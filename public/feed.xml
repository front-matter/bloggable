        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than 200 health journals today published an editorial calling for urgent action to keep average global temperature increases below 1.5°C, halt the destruction of nature, and protect health. The editorial can be read for example <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1734">here</a> (published under a CC-BY Open Access license), and the full list of participating journals can be found <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/full-list-authors-and-signatories-climate-emergency-editorial-september-2021">here</a>.</p><blockquote>The greatest threat to global public health is the continued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5°C and to restore nature. Urgent, society-wide changes must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world. We, as editors of health journals, call for governments and other leaders to act, marking 2021 as the year that the world finally changes course.</blockquote><p>The COVID Pandemic is currently taking up all our attention. But we should not loose time addressing the environmental crisis triggered by climate change, and having a significant negative impact on global health, both via direct effects of global heating and extreme weather events, and indirectly via reduced food production.</p><p>This joint editorial by more than 200 health journals worldwide is yet another clear sign of the urgency of the situation, and the need for action. And we should not forget that health is just one aspect of how the climate crisis is seriously affecting all our lives, in particular those most vulnerable.</p><p>The editorial makes a strong point that the time for action is now, and that wealthy nations must do much more, and much faster. It is also an opportunity to think about what we as individuals can do, whether it is about re-evaluating our individual carbon footprint, thinking about what political parties we support (Germany where I live for example has a federal election in three weeks), and whether the organizations we work for can do more to slow down global warming.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://www.force11.org/blog/step-forward-software-citation-githubs-enhanced-software-citation-support">Cross-posted</a> from the FORCE11 blog. Authors: Martin Fenner, Stephan Druskat, Neil Chue Hong, Daniel S. Katz, Morane Gruenpeter, Arfon Smith, Tom Morell and Robert Haines</em></p><p>On August 19, <a href="https://github.blog/2021-08-19-enhanced-support-citations-github/">GitHub announced</a> software citation support in GitHub repositories. Citation information provided by users (using a CITATION.cff YAML file in the root directory of the default branch) is parsed and made available as bibtex file or formatted citation, currently supporting the APA citation style. The APA style is a good start as it is the only popular citation style that labels software with the string <code>[Computer software]</code> but we hope to see support for more citation styles – including those popular in computer science – going forward. Going forward we also hope to see support for biblatex and potentially <code>@software</code> as the bibtex entry type.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/August/24th/Bildschirmfoto 2021-08-24 um 18.16.55.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="792" height="626"><figcaption>Cite this repository GitHub example</figcaption></figure><pre><code>@misc{Haines_Ruby_CFF_Library_2021,

  month = {8},
  title = {{Ruby CFF Library}},
  url = {https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff},
  year = {2021}
}</code></pre><p>This is an important step forward for wider software citation adoption, as it allows software authors to provide the required information necessary for citing software directly in a GitHub code repository, and for tools and workflows to integrate with this information. Within days of the initial GitHub announcement via a tweet by GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, we saw support for this new workflow by the scholarly repository <a href="https://twitter.com/ZENODO_ORG/status/1420357001490706442">Zenodo</a> and the reference manager <a href="https://twitter.com/zotero/status/1420515377390530560">Zotero</a> (see below). The <a href="https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-indexer/metadata-workflow.html">swh-indexer</a> by <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/">Software Heritage</a> (SWH) already indexed and supported searching over the CITATION.cff files available on the HEAD/master branch of a repository archived in SWH.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve added support for GitHub’s new citation feature. When saving GitHub repos to your library, Zotero can now use the enhanced metadata provided by developers.<br><br>If there’s no citation file, Zotero will continue to use the existing repo metadata (Company, Prog. Language, etc.). <a href="https://t.co/Q34zPBRGFj">https://t.co/Q34zPBRGFj</a></p>&mdash; Zotero (@zotero) <a href="https://twitter.com/zotero/status/1420515377390530560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</figure><p>We also see hundreds of repositories adding CITATION.cff files every week since the initial announcement – you can track the adoption via <a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;p=1&amp;q=CITATION.cff&amp;s=committer-date&amp;type=Commits">this</a> GitHub query.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/August/24th/Bildschirmfoto 2021-08-24 um 18.24.19.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="964"><figcaption>Tracking Citation.CFF files via GitHub query</figcaption></figure><p>While a citation pointing to the GitHub code repository is a great start, ideally the software author wants to perform an important additional step: archive the source code in a long-term archive either via the Software Heritage universal software archive (detailed instructions <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/save-and-reference-research-software/">here</a>, and automatable from the GitHub repository with a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/save-to-software-heritage">GitHub Action</a>), and/or the scholarly repository Zenodo via the the <em>Making Your Code Citable</em> workflow described <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">here</a>, which will use the metadata provided in a CITATION.cff file.</p><p>One particular challenge with citing software is versioning, where there are multiple use cases to be supported, including the need to cite a specific version, and to aggregate the citations of all versions in a single place. There is more work needed to link <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a> to the version information provided in this new GitHub feature, and to support the generic citation without a specific version – what Zenodo calls a <em>concept DOI</em>, and the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) call an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records"><em>expression</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Many software authors also want to link to a publication describing their software from the GitHub repository, and the <a href="https://citation-file-format.github.io/">Citation File Format</a> (CFF) supports this via a ‘<a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md#credit-redirection">preferred-citation</a>’ field. Additionally, authors can cite the software (and other works) their software builds on in a ‘<a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md#referencing-other-work">references</a>’ section in CFF files. Software authors are expected to provide the relevant information in a CITATION.cff file in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> format that follows the <a href="https://citation-file-format.github.io/">Citation File Format</a> specification. An example CITATION.cff file can be found <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/ruby-cff/blob/main/CITATION.cff">here</a>.</p><p>Some software authors might want to use tools to help generate the CITATION.cff file. A starting point is the CFF Initializer available <a href="https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/">here</a>, and a list of available tools for working with CFF files <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/README.md#tools-to-work-with-citationcff-files-wrench">here</a>; we expect more tools to appear over time. There are many standards for describing software (we already mentioned bibtex and DOI metadata), and <a href="https://codemeta.github.io/">CodeMeta</a> also plays a particularly important role by providing <a href="https://codemeta.github.io/crosswalk/">crosswalks</a> and tools for converting between the various metadata standards for software. Going forward we expect to see more metadata conversion workflows, in particular via <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, adding to the already existing <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cffconvert">cffconvert</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/codemeta2cff">CodeMeta2CFF</a> GitHub Actions. We also hope to see similar software citation support appear in the GitLab platform.<br></p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/support-open-source"/>
        <updated>2021-08-12T14:56:42.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago GitHub introduced the ability to sponsor an open source contributor – person or organization. They handle (and pay for) the payment logistics for a one-time or regular contribution. A <a href="https://github.blog/2019-06-12-faq-with-the-github-sponsors-team/">blog post from June 2019</a> describes the thinking of the GiHub Sponsors team that went into this service, and the practicalities of using the service are documented <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/sponsoring-open-source-contributors/sponsoring-an-open-source-contributor">here</a>.</p><p>In my <a href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/how-readers-can-support">last blog post</a> I talked about a similar concept, supporting this blog via a one-time donation or small monthly contribution. Similar to GitHub sponsors this is also a small voluntary contribution rather than a required payment, and it depends on a backend service that can handle small contributions of just a few dollars/euros.</p><p>Readers of this blog know that I am a big fan of dog food (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">saying</a> not the food). In this case it means that Front Matter should become a GitHub sponsor for open source software it depends on. As a small startup you have to start somewhere, and the pick for the first organization to support was an easy one: <a href="https://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a> (CSL). For practical reasons Front Matter sponsors Rintze Zelle, one of the main contributors to CSL:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/August/12th/Bildschirmfoto 2021-08-12 um 16.06.31.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1070" height="555"><figcaption>Front Matter GitHub sponsoring</figcaption></figure><p>The reason I picked CSL is that I never seen an open source project contributing to scholarly infrastructure so much with so little resources. CSL is everywhere (see the list of software products using CSL <a href="https://citationstyles.org/">here</a>), and has been for many years. And there is no big organization standing behind CSL that pays a salary that allows one or more developers to work on CSL, a common pattern with important open source software. So a big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/bdarcus">Bruce D'Arcus</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/skornblith">Simon Kornblith</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fgbjr">Frank Bennett</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rintzezelle">Rintze Zelle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adam42smith">Sebastian Karcher</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/1nukshuk">Sylvester Keil</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/johanneskrtek">Johannes Krtek</a>, Liam Magee, <a href="https://twitter.com/cparnot">Charles Parnot</a>, Carles Pina, Andrea Rossato, <a href="https://twitter.com/danstillman">Dan Stillman</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/zuphilip">Philipp Zumstein</a>, to name just a few of the many contributors to CSL. You can thank them yourself in the <a href="https://discourse.citationstyles.org/">CSL discussion forum</a>, but if your own software depends on CSL, please consider GitHub sponsorship.</p><p>GitHub sponsors and donations and memberships for the Front Matter blog are of course flavors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a>, which has an interesting history and many success stories you can learn from, and mistakes to avoid.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Front Matter blog <a href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/front-matter-officially-launches-today">launched last week</a> and while the content is currently only written by me, I hope this will change in the coming months to include one-time guest posts and regular writers. One challenge is to figure out how to finance the blog in the long run. Running blog infrastructure is not overtly expensive, and in the case of the Front Matter blog amounts to about 120€/$140 a month:</p><ul><li>hosting Ghost blog editor 15€/month (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>)</li><li>hosting Next.js frontend 20€/month (<a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>)</li><li>hosting full-text search index 35€/month (<a href="https://typesense.org/">Typesense</a>)</li><li>hosting Discourse commenting platform 15€/month (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>)</li><li>web analytics €5/month (<a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>)</li><li>registration domain name 35€/year (<a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple</a>) </li><li>DOI registration €300/year (estimate, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a>)</li></ul><p>The cost not reflected above, is of course staff time for writing blog posts, but also editing, deciding on topics, reaching out to potential writers, etc. A reasonable goal would be to pay for an editor one day a week, which would add about 1280€/1500$ to the monthly cost running the blog. How can this be supported financially?</p><p>While there is always the hope of finding an organization (funder, publisher, institution, infrastructure provider, etc.) that cares enough about Open Science to pay for running this blog, a more realistic alternative is to depend on reader contributions, combined with volunteer donations. </p><p>Advertisements are a very painful way to recover even a fraction of the costs for running a blog that caters to a relatively small audience (scholarly communication). In response several platforms, including <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, have evolved with a business model focused on providing exclusive content to paying subscribers. This is obviously not an option for an Open Science blog, where the assumption is that content is free to read and reuse under a Creative Commons license.</p><p>Today the Front Matter blog is starting a newsletter with a small monthly subscription fee (3€/month or 30€/year). The newsletter does not provide exclusive content, but rather is a convenience for users to directly receive content in their email inbox rather than via the <a href="https://blog.front-matter.io/feed.xml">the Front Matter RSS Feed</a>. In addition, users can give one-time donations to support the Front Matter blog. These payment options are provided by <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">Buy Me a Coffee</a>, with a <a href="https://blog.front-matter.io/support">link</a> to the membership/support page in the footer of every Front Matter page  (see screenshot below).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/August/9th/Bildschirmfoto 2021-08-09 um 20.21.20.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2210" height="1252"><figcaption><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/frontmatter">Buy Me a Coffee page</a> for Front Matter</figcaption></figure><p>I hope that by the end of the year, some revenue will accrue that can support the Front Matter blog. It would definitely be a strong motivation to write regular Open Science blog posts with interesting content. A related aim of course is to nurture active and engaged readers who write comments in response to the posts, suggest topics to write about, and generally tell me via comments or email how Front Matter can do better.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The open source research data management platform InvenioRDM <a href="https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/releases/versions/version-v6.0.0/   ">today announced</a> the first Long-Term Support (LTS) release, usable on production services. And I am joining the effort as a participating partner via <a href="https://front-matter.io">Front Matter</a>, the organization I started this week.</p><p>InvenioRDM was <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/blog/2019-04-29-rdm/">first announced in April 2019</a>:</p><blockquote>Our vision in the next five-years, is to make InvenioRDM a world-leading extensible research data management platform used by research institutions all around the world and with businesses providing services, support and customizations on top of InvenioRDM. </blockquote><p>The first concrete set of goals was defined as</p><ul><li>A stable InvenioRDM platform - A research data management platform based on <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> and the <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/">Invenio v3 Framework</a>.</li><li>A community of public and private institutions to sustain InvenioRDM.</li><li>Minimum two existing repositories migrated to InvenioRDM, with Zenodo being one of them.</li></ul><p>Today's release brings invenioRDM much closer to achieving these goals. The next major milestone for InvenioRDM is to migrate <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> to run on top of InvenioRDM.</p><p>In the coming two months I will not only try to get up to speed with the invenioRDM project and start working with the CERN team and the other participating partners, but I also have the specific task of making sure invenioRDM fully supports the data citation roadmap for scholarly data repositories, work done by the <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/dcip">Force11 DCIP project</a> with Merce Crosas and me as co-leads, and described in a 2019 <em>Scientific Data</em> paper (Fenner <em>et al</em>. 2019):</p><h3 id="guidelines-for-repositories-1-5-required-6-9-recommended-10-11-optional">Guidelines for Repositories (1-5 required, 6-9 recommended, 10-11 optional)</h3><ol><li>All datasets intended for citation must have a globally unique persistent identifier that can be expressed as an unambiguous URL.</li><li>Persistent identifiers for datasets must support multiple levels of granularity, where appropriate.</li><li>The persistent identifier expressed as an URL must resolve to a landing page specific for that dataset, and that landing page must contain metadata describing the dataset.</li><li>The persistent identifier must be embedded in the landing page in machine-readable format.</li><li>The repository must provide documentation and support for data citation.</li><li>The landing page should include metadata required for citation, and ideally also metadata facilitating discovery, in human-readable and machine-readable format.</li><li>The machine-readable metadata should use schema.org markup in JSON-LD format.</li><li>Metadata should be made available via HTML meta tags to facilitate use by reference managers.</li><li>Metadata should be made available for download in BibTeX and/or another standard bibliographic format.</li><li>Content negotiation for schema.org/JSON-LD and other content types may be supported so that the persistent identifier expressed as URL resolves directly to machine-readable metadata.</li><li>HTTP link headers may be supported to advertise content negotiation options</li></ol><p>Several of these recommendations are of course already addressed by invenioRDM, but there is more work needed in the details, e.g. how metadata are exposed in dataset landing pages using schema.org. And these recommendations have evolved, e.g. as described in the output of the <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/research-metadata-schemas-wg">Research Data Alliance (RDA) Research Metadata Schemas Working Group</a> published in June (Wu <em>et al. </em>2021).</p><p>Please reach out to me in the comments or via email if you have any questions or suggestions regarding this upcoming work, or more generally my new involvement in invenioRDM.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Fenner, M., Crosas, M., Grethe, J.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Front Matter describes the content preceding the main text of a book or journal. In science, several research journals, including <em>PLOS Biology</em>, <em>Nature</em> and <em>Science</em>, have Front Matter sections, used for news, opinions, and other content that are not a research articles. Front Matter is also the name of the company that I registered last month, as I think it is a good fit for what I am trying to accomplish, after leaving the DOI registration agency DataCite in July 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/zx3k-3923">Farewell to DataCite</a>), having been their Technical Director for six years.</p><p>I sincerely believe that there is a need for more venues that talk about emerging scholarly content types such as research data, research software or preprints as scholarly outputs. The Front Matter Blog hopes to become such a venue. As a starting point I have added (almost) all my blog posts since 2007, collected from my previous blogging locations (<em>Nature Network</em>, <em>PLOS Blogs, </em>my Personal Blog, and the DataCite blog<em>)</em>, and I hope at least some of them still make an interesting read all these years later. Technically, the blog uses <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and the Ghost Editor as a backend, and a frontend built with <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, a common <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> setup: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/August/2nd/jamstack-javascript-apis-markup.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="850" height="394"><figcaption>Jamstack, via <a href="https://snipcart.com/blog/jamstack">Snipcart</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Two features of the Front Matter Blog are particularly important to me:</p><ul><li>full-text search of all blog posts (with the help of  <a href="https://typesense.org/">Typesense</a>), as tags, categories, and search by title allow only limited content discovery, and  </li><li>comments using a mature and open commenting system (<a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>).</li></ul><p>There is more work planned for the coming months, with the next milestone being the registration of DOIs for all blog posts.</p><p>But Front Matter is more than a blogging platform.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After six years as DataCite Technical Director, I am both sad and excited to announce that I will be leaving DataCite, beginning a new adventure as an independent developer for the <a href="https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/">invenioRDM</a> project on August 1st. My focus will remain on research data management, but with a different angle.</p><p>A lot has changed since 2015 at DataCite in general, and the DataCite technical architecture in particular. Rather than describe the work on DataCite infrastructure over the past six years in more detail, I want to provide a snapshot of where the DataCite infrastructure is with its core services, and what considerations the team is taking into account going forward.</p><h3 id="content-registration">Content registration</h3><p>DataCite members can register DOIs and metadata for content using the Metadata Store (MDS). The MDS API hasn’t changed much for users since 2012, although the technology powering the API has been replaced more than once, and the metadata schema is constantly evolving. We have added a JSON REST API and web frontend (<a href="https://doi.datacite.org/">Fabrica</a>) starting in 2017. Going forward we hope to see more adoption of the JSON REST API, e.g. by finalizing and promoting the JSON schema. And we may want to explore other ways to register content, namely by embedding metadata in landing pages using schema.org in combination with sitemaps files.</p><h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3><p>In October 2020 DataCite launched <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/">DataCite Commons</a> as a new discovery platform, followed by an announcement to retire DataCite Search by the end of 2021. DataCite Commons enables the discovery of connections between content, people, and organizations. DataCite Commons uses the existing DataCite backend infrastructure with relational databases and Elasticsearch in combination with a new <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> API. Going forward we will see whether this approach scales appropriately, or whether a different technology is needed to power DataCite Commons. This would include the exploration of graph database technologies such as neo4j with or without GraphQL. Further, we will work to track the adoption of GraphQL and our REST API architecture.</p><h3 id="backend-services">Backend services</h3><p>DataCite as an infrastructure provider has always focussed on backend APIs and related services. As part of this work, DataCite has migrated to a Docker container-based cloud architecture. There is still work ahead, from migrating to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> to service meshes and better monitoring and handling of service loads.</p><h3 id="frontend-services">Frontend services</h3><p>The DataCite frontend service architecture has gradually evolved over the last six years, with the new services Fabrica and DataCite Commons using modern Javascript frameworks (Ember.js and Next.js, respectively). One side effect of this gradual evolution is a rather complex mix of technologies. Going forward, rewriting outdated services, and consolidating the various technologies are important goals. Combined with this could be the broader use of <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">serverless architectures</a> which we started using in DataCite Commons.</p><h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3><p>DataCite is in a good position to handle our technology projects during this transition. I have been working closely with the DataCite team to transition responsibilities and will continue to be involved in community initiatives. Matt will publish a blog post next week that will cover the future team structure.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/zx3k-3923">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DataCite is a DOI registration agency that enables the registration of scholarly content with a persistent identifier (DOI) and metadata. This content can then be searched for, reused, and connected to other scholarly resources. But how does the underlying infrastructure enable this? In this blog post, we will describe what we have built to make this work. This is a fairly technical post, as I tried to go a little deeper into the details.</p><h3 id="cloud-hosting-and-devops">Cloud hosting and DevOps</h3><p>DataCite is a small nonprofit organization (<a href="https://datacite.org/staff.html">currently 12 team members</a>, including three in the development team), and the team is fully remote. All our infrastructure is running in the Cloud (most of it using Amazon Web Services (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>), with the servers that store data located in Ireland). We have automated the operation of our services as much as possible, following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> best practices. Because of the small team size, we have no separation of software development and system administration teams, and DevOps allows us to highly integrate these roles. Two important automation tools we use are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> for Continues Integration/Continues Deployment (CI/CD) and <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> for managing “Infrastructure as Code”. While we are using Terraform since 2016, we have only recently migrated our CI/CD workflows from <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a> (finishing the migration in the next few months), mainly because GitHub Actions come with many ready-to-use actions for some of the more complex parts of our deployment pipeline. All DataCite software is available with an open license in a public GitHub repository, and that also includes our GitHub actions and Terraform configurations. You can for example find the code for our REST API <a href="https://github.com/datacite/lupo">here</a>, and the corresponding GitHub actions <a href="https://github.com/datacite/lupo/tree/master/.github/workflows">here</a>.</p><h3 id="datacite-backend-services">DataCite backend services</h3><p>The DataCite backend uses services that store data (files or databases), and we use managed AWS services for those, e.g. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">RDS</a> to manage our MySQL relational databases. Our APIs are all running as stateless Docker containers, and we use the Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">ECS</a>), in combination with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/">Amazon Application Load Balancers</a> to manage those. The adoption of Docker containers was the biggest change in our infrastructure 2016-2019, and we have developed a lot of expertise in this area. Going forward we will switch to Kubernetes (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">AWS Kubernetes Service</a>) at some point, as it has become the de-facto standard for container management in the cloud and provides additional functionalities in a widely-used open source platform. In 2015 all backend services were written in Java, over the last six years – as we upgraded our services one after another – this has changed to backend services written in Ruby and Python. This might again change going forward, we have for example started to use an <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">open source software for collecting usage stats</a> that is written in Elixir. While we have to be careful as a small development team to not spread our expertise too wide, we need to be open to new technologies, and a grant-funded project that can be based on existing open source software</p><h3 id="datacite-frontend-services">DataCite frontend services</h3><p>The DataCite frontend services have over time been clearly separated from backend services, with only one service still running as a full-stack service (mainly because of the special needs for authentication). <a href="https://github.com/datacite/bracco">DataCite Fabrica</a> is our main service for account management and DOI registration and was originally launched in September 2017. Fabrica uses the Ember.js Javascript framework. Ember.js addresses the needs we have for this service but has not seen the same level of adoption as some other Javascript frameworks, namely React or Vue. When we launched <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/">DataCite Commons</a> – our replacement for the DataCite Search discovery service – in October 2020, we decided to use the <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> framework (based on React), together with GraphQL as the query language for our APIs. Next.js supports server-side rendering, which enabled us to provide embedded metadata (in particular in <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> format) that are picked up by Google (e.g. for Google Dataset Search) and other indexers. The initial experience has been positive and we are going to not only build out the functionality – and performance – of DataCite Commons, but over time also transition our legacy frontend services to the same platform – currently we are using six different technologies for those, as they were built over time in the last ten years. We can then also explore more the use of <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">serverless</a> as a technology to support our frontend services, as we are doing with DataCite Commons, running on the <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> platform.</p><p>The following picture puts everything I talked about together into a single view (obviously omitting a lot of detail):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/reference_architecture.png" class="kg-image" alt="Reference architecture" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Reference architecture</figcaption></figure><p>Please feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:mfenner@datacite.org">me</a> if you have any questions about the DataCite technology stack.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Metadata that describes scientific software in standard ways – in particular citation metadata such as title, authors, publication year, and venue – is essential for proper software citation implementation. The metadata should be generated by the software author, stored in the code repository, included in submissions to journals, and archived with the source code in a software archive. The CodeMeta community has created such a standard vocabulary, with version 2.0 of the metadata schema released in 2017, and with mappings to common metadata standards for software source code, including DataCite metadata. Since that release, a task force of the Force11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group with co-chairs Morane Gruenpeter from Software Heritage and Martin Fenner from DataCite has worked on updating the schema to version 3.0, with a particular focus on aligning the CodeMeta schema with schema.org metadata.</p><p>The following terms in CodeMeta 2.0 are not (yet) part of schema.org:</p><ul><li>softwareSuggestions</li><li>maintainer</li><li>contIntegration</li><li>buildInstructions</li><li>developmentStatus</li><li>embargoDate</li><li>funding</li><li>issueTracker</li><li>referencePublication</li><li>Readme</li></ul><p>The CodeMeta Task Force of the Force11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group is now seeking community input via the CodeMeta GitHub issue tracker (summarized in <a href="https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/issues/232">https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/issues/232</a>). The task force asks for input until June 15, so that CodeMeta version 3.0 can ideally be finalized by July. After this work is done, the task force will propose the integration of all CodeMeta terms into the schema.org schema, so that CodeMeta becomes fully aligned with schema.org for better interoperability with existing documentation, tooling, and related communities.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DataCite and the <a href="https://www.project-freya.eu/en">FREYA project</a> partners are proud to announce the official launch of <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/">DataCite Commons</a> today. DataCite Commons is the web interface to explore the PID Graph, formed by the publications, datasets, research software, and other research outputs generated by researchers working at research institutions and supported by grant funding (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>). The PID Graph depends on persistent identifiers to uniquely identify all these resources, and metadata that describe these resources and their connections.</p><p>We launched a pre-release version of DataCite Commons in August [Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-commons-at-your-service/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/f4df-4817">2020a</a>)] and have used the last two months not only for many small improvements and bug fixes, but also to add two important new features: a statistics page that describes the information available in the PID Graph, and personal accounts that allow for ORCID claiming and other functionality going forward.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-10-28-um-11.42.23.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="DataCite Commons data sources summarized on the DataCite Commons statistics page."></figure><p>While DataCite Commons includes all PIDs and metadata from DataCite and Research Organization Registry (ROR), it currently includes only a subset of metadata from ORCID, and only a subset of DOIs and metadata from Crossref. Other persistent identifiers for scholarly resources will be added over time. The statistics page shows the current coverage of DataCite Commons and thus the FREYA PID Graph. The statistics page also shows the current numbers of the connections between works, between works and people, and between works and organizations, allowing us to track the growth of the PID Graph over time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-10-28-um-12.02.32.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="DataCite Commons personal accounts showing the ORCID claiming status."></figure><p>User accounts are the other big change in this DataCite Commons release. They make it easier to navigate to your personal DataCite Commons page, listing all your publications, datasets, and software that DataCite Commons knows about. But more importantly, these personal accounts enable ORCID claiming, adding one or more works to your ORCID Record. When you search for works in DataCite Commons after logging in, you can see the works that have already been sent to your ORCID Record by DataCite, or an error message is shown if something went wrong. The next step, actual claiming from DataCite Commons search results, is in the final phase of development and will be open for beta testers in November.</p><p>This release of DataCite Commons wraps up the work on the PID Graph in the FREYA project, which will end at the end of November. We went from the initial idea for the PID Graph concept to the implementation of a production service for users, following the process summarized below.</p><h3 id="user-story-collection-and-prioritization">User story collection and prioritization</h3><p>In 2018 the FREYA project partners started collecting user stories that address important needs of their respective communities. In an August 2018 workshop we discussed these user stories, grouped them together, and prioritized them. The main categories were the aggregation of scholarly outputs, e.g. by research institution, funder, or researcher; the versioning and granularity of data and software, and the grouping of all research outputs and other resources (e.g. data, software, people, funding) for a given publication. All these user stories depend on a PID Graph, with typically two connections needed in the graph, e.g. “show me all citations for datasets funded by a particular grant”.</p><h3 id="technical-architecture-and-api-development">Technical architecture and API development</h3><p>Based on these requirements we started to investigate if our existing technical architecture supported these user stories, or what changes would be needed. The initial exploration looked at incremental changes to our existing REST APIs, but it became clear that more fundamental changes would be needed, supporting queries of the PID Graph in a number of different ways. In the spring of 2019, we decided to use GraphQL as the underlying technology for the PID Graph, as it supports the kinds of queries common in the PID Graph, is widely adopted in terms of software libraries, documentation, and developer community, and can be easily integrated into existing backend systems such as relational databases and search indexes such as Solr or Elasticsearch. DataCite released a GraphQL API pre-release version in May 2019, and a production version in May 2020 (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-commons-at-your-service/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/yfck-mv39">2020b</a>).</p><h3 id="web-frontend-development">Web frontend development</h3><p>The GraphQL API we had developed allowed us to address the user stories we identified, and we started to write Jupyter notebooks as a platform that makes it easier to work with the GraphQL API, and in August 2020 the FREYA project released ten Jupyter notebooks addressing some of the user stories we had identified (Fenner &amp; Petryszak, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-commons-at-your-service/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4004426">2020</a>). But APIs and Juypter notebooks are still a significant hurdle for many users, and in the spring of 2020 we started work on a web frontend for the GraphQL API and thus the PID Graph. In August 2020 we launched a pre-release version of this web frontend and called it DataCite Commons (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-commons-at-your-service/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/f4df-4817">2020a</a>). Today we are officially releasing DataCite Commons (Fenner, Hallett, Garza, &amp; Wimalaratne, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-commons-at-your-service/#ref-https://doi.org/10.14454/qgk4-zs88">2020</a>) as the web frontend for the FREYA PID Graph and as a key FREYA contribution to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).</p><h3 id="monitoring-and-feedback">Monitoring and feedback</h3><p>The release of DataCite Commons is an important milestone, but more work is needed to make sure that DataCite Commons addresses the needs of its users, and that the service sees significant use by the community. The focus for the next few months will therefore be on monitoring for traffic, bugs and other issues, and feedback collection regarding additional features.

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/datacite-switches-to-globus-for-authentication"/>
        <updated>2020-10-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Access to some DataCite resources and services requires authentication so that DataCite knows who is making a request. This includes <a href="https://doi.datacite.org/">Fabrica</a>, our DOI registration service that requires a member account, but also our integration with ORCID in the <a href="https://profiles.datacite.org/">Profiles</a> service, where researchers authenticate with us to allow us to send information about content with DataCite DOIs authored by them to their ORCID record.</p><p>Authentication needs to be secure, not allowing access by the wrong people, but also practical, as otherwise poor password behavior with reduced security might result, as highlighted in the 2019 update of the NIST guidelines (Grassi, Garcia, &amp; Fenton (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/globus-authentication/#ref-https://doi.org/10.6028/nist.sp.800-63-3">2017</a>)) that set the industry standard. With this in mind, we have two main goals for improving authentication with DataCite services: a) phase-out of institutional logins in favor of more secure personal accounts, and b) consolidate authentication into a single service to simply access to all secured resources.</p><p>We started work on improving DataCite authentication two months ago, beginning with a major upgrade of the <a href="https://profiles.datacite.org/">Profiles</a> service. We are relaunching this upgraded service today. Most changes are under the hood and not visible to users; they include much-needed maintenance work, but also an improved administration interface for DataCite staff.</p><p>One visible change for users is the new sign in via Globus. <a href="https://www.globus.org/">Globus</a>, an initiative at the University of Chicago - and a DataCite member -, is a non-profit service that provides reliable data transfer and sharing, and authentication services for the research community. Globus’ overall mission not only aligns well with DataCite’s mission but its authentication service, Globus Auth, provides the functionality needed by DataCite and DataCite users. The previous version of the Profiles service allowed login via ORCID, Google, and GitHub, but did not support the use of institutional identities. Globus allows users to login with their institutional account, supporting several hundred such federated identities via InCommon and eduGAIN federations and other custom identity providers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2019-10-09-um-19.16.21.png" class="kg-image" alt="New Profiles sign in screen" loading="lazy"></figure><p>New Profiles sign in screen</p><p>DataCite now integrates with Globus via OpenID Connect, and requires that users login either with their ORCID identity or with another identity (e.g., an institutional account) linked to that ORCID identity via Globus. We use the ORCID ID to identify the user independent of email addresses or other information that may change over time, aligned with the recommendation of using the eduPersonORCID property in Federated Identity Management (Demeranville (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/globus-authentication/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1064011">2017</a>)). For authenticating ORCID claiming, a second step is needed, obtaining the required permissions directly from ORCID to write to the user’s ORCID record. This integration of Globus allows DataCite to focus on providing persistent identifier services, while relying on Globus for authentication services.</p><p>While connecting authentication via OpenID Connect is straightforward, we made the process even easier for Ruby users by writing the omniauth-globus Ruby gem (Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/globus-authentication/#ref-https://doi.org/10.14454/81gp-9y63">2019</a>)) that requires only the minimal configuration of a CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REDIRECT_URL.</p><p>This change is just the first step in our work on improving authentication to DataCite services. As a next step, we will provide personal accounts, roles, and permissions for our DOI registration service Fabrica, which currently uses a separate authentication workflow and institutional accounts. We will continue partnering with Globus to wrap up this work before the end of 2019 but will keep the login option via institutional accounts until the end of 2020. In early 2020, we will start providing authentication tokens (in addition to basic authentication via username/password) for API users, and we will improve our integration with ORCID via a pilot of the <a href="https://members.orcid.org/service-provider-workflow">ORCID token delegation</a> workflow.</p><p>If you have any questions about these authentication updates, don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@datacite.org">mailto:support@datacite.org</a>.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/08jb-pn73">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Demeranville, T.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Metadata are essential for finding, accessing, and reusing scholarly content, i.e. to increase the FAIRness [Wilkinson et al. (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/making-the-most/#ref-https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">2016</a>)] of datasets and other scholarly resources. A rich and standardized metadata schema that is widely used is the first step, encouraging users to register these metadata (as many of these are optional and not required) is the second step, while infrastructure providers such as DataCite facilitating metadata registration and making the most of the available metadata is the third step. While we all have put considerable energy into the first two steps, I want to use this blog post to describe what DataCite is doing to improve metadata FAIRness via our services. I will focus on three important optional metadata properties and on two approaches: encouraging metadata registration in a standardized way using the new DOI form in our Fabrica service, and improving discovery via search filters in the next major release of DataCite Search, that we have started development work on.</p><h3 id="language">Language</h3><p>DataCite metadata can include the primary language of the resource, using either the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</a> (e.g. <em>en-US</em>) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1">ISO 639-1</a> (e.g. <em>en</em>) controlled vocabularies. In the context of discovery, the ISO 639-1 code is most helpful, as we want to find resources we can understand because we speak the language, and not necessarily care about the nuances of for example U.S. English vs. British English. In Fabrica, the DOI form uses the list of languages in ISO 639-1, and that is also what we will use for filters in search.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-07-09-um-07.03.28.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="DOI form language"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-07-09-um-07.03.56.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Search facet language"></figure><p>Going forward, it would make sense to consider allowing multiple languages per resource. This will not only allow using both BCP 47 and ISO 639-1, addressing different use cases, but will also allow the proper description of multilingual resources.</p><h3 id="rights">Rights</h3><p>Rights information about a resource is essential, as it informs the user if and under what conditions the resource can be reused. In order to allow users to filter by a specific license, rights information needs to be normalized. In theory, a URL pointing to a specific license is all that is needed, but we also need a human-readable string, and ideally also an abbreviation for the license (e.g. Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International and CC-BY-4.0 for https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), and, more importantly, many licenses have more than one URL, e.g.</p><ul><li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0</a></li><li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></li><li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a></li><li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode</a></li></ul><p>We can address this by normalizing the URLs for all licenses, and providing a standard name and abbreviation. Luckily, this work has already been done by the [Software Package Data Exchange](https://spdx.dev/) (SPDX) project of the Linux Foundation. While SPDX focusses on software licenses, it also includes all Creative Commons licenses, which are the most common licenses used in DataCite metadata for data and text. In metadata schema 4.2, released in March 2019, we added the properties <em>rightsIdentifier</em>, <em>rightsIdentifierScheme</em> and <em>schemeURI</em>, and this enables the use of SPDX. In the past few months we have added SPDX support to the DOI form, and we will have search facets based on SPDX.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-07-09-um-07.35.30.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="DOI form rights"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-07-09-um-07.36.41.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Search facet license"></figure><h3 id="subject-area">Subject Area</h3><p>DataCite metadata have a very flexible Subject property, with sub-properties <em>SubjectScheme</em>, <em>SchemeURI</em>, and <em>ValueURI</em>. Unfortunately there is no standard way to describe the subject area covered by the resource. This makes it difficult to find content described by DataCite metadata in for example Mathematics, or to understand to what extend the various disciplines use DataCite DOIs. There are many subject area classification schemes, but the most widely used generic classification scheme is the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf">OECD Fields of Science classification</a> with 6 top-level categories and 42 subcategories. We have implemented the OECD Fields of Science classification in the DOI form, and will do so in search facets.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-07-09-um-07.51.23.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="DOI form subject"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-07-09-um-07.52.20.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Search field of science facet"></figure><p>While OECD Fields of Science is the most commonly used generic subject classification, the most widely used subject classification we currently find in DataCite metadata is the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/6BB427AB9696C225CA2574180004463E?opendocument">Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) Fields of Research</a>. This classification is much more detailed, supporting different use case. Luckily there is an official ANZSRC mapping to the OECD Fields of Science. This allows us to automatically add the OECD Fields of Science category or subcategory if the ANZSRC Fields of Research is used in DataCite metadata.</p><h3 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h3><p>We hope that the DOI form makes it easier to register more of the optional but important metadata in a standardized way, and that the new search filters we are launching in a few months will improve discoverability of the content. And that in turn this encourages DataCite members and their repositories to include this information in DOI metadata also when using one of the DataCite APIs for DOI registration. There are sometimes good reason to do things differently, and this also includes metadata for language, rights and subject. The DataCite metadata schema provides the flexibility needed, but we hope that in most cases the standard vocabularies ISO 639-1, SPDX and OECD Fields of Science will be used, improving the finding, accessing, and reusing of scholarly content with DataCite metadata for everyone.</p><p>Of course we shouldn’t forget the important work of the DataCite Metadata Working Group, which is busy working on the next DataCite schema version. That is a topic for another blog post, but I can already tell you that DataCite metadata will better support text documents.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/1dgk-1m22">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Wilkinson, M.

        <updated>2020-08-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today DataCite is proud to announce the launch of <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/">DataCite Commons</a>, available at <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/">https://commons.datacite.org</a>. DataCite Commons is a discovery service that enables simple searches while giving users a comprehensive overview of connections between entities in the research landscape. This means that DataCite members registering DOIs with us will have easier access to information about the use of their DOIs and can discover and track connections between their DOIs and other entities. DataCite Commons was developed as part of the EC-funded project Freya and will form the basis of new DataCite services.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-08-25-um-06.46.42.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Search for works in DataCite Commons"></figure><h3 id="content">Content</h3><p>DataCite Commons has a lot of content to search for. One of the most important features is the ability to search for all DOIs, no matter whether registered with DataCite, Crossref, or one of the other scholarly DOI registration agencies. Users want to search for content or look up metadata for a particular DOI, and not worry about where to look. DataCite initially focused on registering DOIs for datasets (approaching 8 million DOIs so far), but our members to date have also registered almost 6 million DOIs for text publications. At the same time, Crossref members have given almost 2 million DOIs to datasets in addition to the DOIs for journal articles, book chapters, and other text publications. Other content types can be equally found at both DataCite and Crossref, e.g. dissertations or preprints. And there are 6 more <a href="https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html">DOI registration agencies</a> that register DOIs for scholarly content. Including the more than 110 million Crossref DOIs in DataCite Commons is a huge undertaking. We currently have 10 million Crossref DOIs in DataCite Commons with the import of many more DOIs ongoing, together with 20 million DOIs from DataCite.</p><h3 id="connections">Connections</h3><p>DataCite Commons not only has a lot more content to search for but also exposes the connections between DOIs in the form of citations, versions, and collections. DataCite Commons also shows the connections between content with DOIs and people, research organizations, and funders – what we together call the PID Graph of scholarly resources identified via persistent identifiers (PIDs) and connected in standard ways. We integrate with both the <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> and <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR</a> (Research Organization Registry) APIs to enable a search for (10 million) people and (100,000) organizations and to show the associated content. For funding, we take advantage of the inclusion of Crossref Funder IDs in ROR metadata. We combine these connections, showing a funder, research organization, or researcher not only their content but also the citations and views and downloads if available, together with aggregate statistics such as numbers by year or content type.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-08-25-um-06.34.23.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Works by organization"></figure><p>For a single work, e.g. the dataset registered with DOI <a href="https://commons.datacite.org/doi.org/10.5061/dryad.234">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.234</a>, we show views, downloads and citations if available:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-08-25-um-06.33.07.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Views, downloads and citations"></figure><h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3><p>By mapping all Crossref metadata to corresponding metadata in DataCite, we can support much more granular search queries compared to just mapping basic metadata. With this release, we are also launching a new set of filters for content search. We added license type, fields of science, primary language, and DOI registration agency to the existing filters publication year and work type. As described in a July blog post (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/power-of-pids/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/1dgk-1m22">2020a</a>), we are using existing controlled vocabularies for these filters (license type: <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a>, fields of science: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/science/inno/38235147.pdf">OECD</a>, and language: <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html">ISO639-1</a>), and are re-indexing all our metadata (almost completed) to align with these standard vocabularies where possible. We encourage our members to use these standard vocabularies when registering content. This should help to find content that has a license that allows unrestricted re-use, and that is in the research field and language we are interested in. Using these widely used vocabularies should help with interoperability with other services.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-08-25-um-06.29.39.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Filtering by license"></figure><h3 id="technology">Technology</h3><p>To make DataCite Commons possible, we built a technology platform that can properly handle the metadata from multiple sources and the rich connections between them. The underlying technology is <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>. Our GraphQL API launched in May 2020 (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/power-of-pids/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/yfck-mv39">2020b</a>) and uses the <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/">graphql-ruby</a> library that also powers the GitHub GraphQL API. The DataCite Commons web frontend is built with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> (together with <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</a>), a popular Javascript Framework, to interact with this GraphQL API. Everything we have built is based on open source software and is made available (<a href="https://github.com/datacite/lupo">API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/datacite/akita">web frontend</a>) with a permissive open source license. As always, we welcome contributions to our source code and are more than happy to help others work with GraphQL.</p><h3 id="project-freya">Project FREYA</h3><p>The work on DataCite Commons is part of the <a href="https://www.project-freya.eu/en">FREYA project</a> that is helping build the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), funded by the European Commission. DataCite Commons fulfills the specific project goals of delivering one Common DOI Search for DOIs from all DOI registration agencies, and of providing an easy to use interface for the PID Graph powered by GraphQL. FREYA will end in November 2020, and we will use the remaining three months to improve the service based on the input we collected so far, and the feedback we will receive with this release. We will focus on supporting researchers and other end-users, building on the schema.org metadata export (Cousijn, Cruse, &amp; Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/power-of-pids/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/5aep-2n86">2018</a>), citation formatting, and ORCID claiming (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/power-of-pids/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/15x1-bj6r">2015</a>) available in DataCite Search. What we released today is the first public version of the service, we will continue adding many more Crossref DOIs and more connections, and work on improving the performance as the system scales. Beyond FREYA, DataCite Commons will be maintained and further developed by DataCite in coordination with other PID providers and the broader open science community. Watch out for a FREYA webinar on DataCite Commons in September.</p><h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3><p>While DataCite Commons is open to everyone to help with the discovery of scholarly resources and its connections that are part of the PID Graph, it provides particular value to DataCite members. The service makes their metadata and content available to a wide audience, helps them discover and report connections such as citations and affiliation and funding information, and provides an open platform for further integrations with other services going forward. We will closely work with DataCite members to further align the new service with their needs and the needs of the communities they serve. We will be actively seeking input as we continue to build on the DataCite Commons and there will be a dedicated Open Hours session in the coming months. If you have feedback at this point, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@datacite.org">DataCite Support</a> or post a message in the DataCite channel of the PID Forum.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/f4df-4817">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Cousijn, H., Cruse, P., &amp; Fenner, M.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In May, the Make Data Count team <a href="https://makedatacount.org/2020/05/05/igniting-change-our-next-steps/">announced</a> that we have received additional funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for work on the Make Data Count (MDC) initiative. This will enable DataCite to do additional work in two important areas:</p><ul><li>Implement a bibliometrics dashboard that enables bibliometricians – funded by a <a href="https://www.scholcommlab.ca/2020/05/04/sloan-announcement/">separate Sloan grant</a> – to do quantitative studies around data usage and citation behaviors.</li><li>Increase adoption of standardized data usage across repositories by developing a log processing service that offloads much of the hard work from repositories.</li></ul><p>In this blog post, we want to provide more technical details about the upcoming work on the bibliometrics dashboard; the log processing service will be the topic of a future blog post. The bibliometrics dashboard will be based on several important infrastructure pieces that DataCite has built over the past few years, and that are again briefly described below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/noun_dashboard_2172952.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="doi-registration-services">DOI registration services</h3><p>In the MDC initiative we track data citations in the scholarly literature, focussing on datasets registered with DataCite and publications registered with Crossref.</p><h3 id="event-data">Event Data</h3><p>We use the joint <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/eventdata-guide">Crossref/DataCite Event Data</a> service to exchange information about connections between publications and datasets, contributed via Crossref and DataCite members through the metadata they register. These connections are also made available via a <a href="http://www.scholix.org/">Scholix</a>-compliant REST API. In the previous MDC project, the Event Data service was expanded to include data usage stats and make retrieving information easier for DataCite members.</p><h3 id="data-usage-reports">Data Usage Reports</h3><p>DataCite members and repositories upload monthly reports about data usage to DataCite using a standard format (<a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/counter-code-practice-research-data-usage-metrics-release-1/">COUNTER Code of Practice for Research Data Usage Metrics</a> and protocol (<a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-sections/sushi/">SUSHI</a>). COUNTER Code of Practice for Research Data Usage Metrics and the DataCite <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/usage-reports-api-guide">usage reports API</a> were developed in the previous MDC project.</p><h3 id="graphql-api">GraphQL API</h3><p>The DataCite GraphQL API [Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-mdc-stack/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/yfck-mv39">2020</a>)] built in the EC-funded <a href="https://www.project-freya.eu/en">FREYA</a> project brings together all of the above information in a single API that supports the complex queries typically needed for retrieving aggregated data citation information.</p><h3 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter Notebooks</h3><p>We use Jupyter notebooks to analyze and visualize the information made available in the GraphQL API [Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-mdc-stack/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/hwaw-xe52">2019</a>)], and have developed documentation, demos, and training material with our partners in the FREYA project.</p><h3 id="common-doi-search">Common DOI Search</h3><p>Common DOI Search, a service currently under development by DataCite with help from Crossref and others in the FREYA project, and with a first version planned to be released in August, will bring a single search interface for all scholarly DOIs, no matter from which DOI registration agency (DataCite, Crossref, etc.). All DOIs in Common DOI Search are in a single Elasticsearch search cluster using the same DataCite metadata schema.</p><h3 id="data-metrics-badge">Data Metrics Badge</h3><p>The Data Metrics Badge – developed as part of the <a href="http://www.belmontforum.org/projects/4057/">Parsec</a> project – is an <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/displaying-usage-and-citations-in-your-repository">easy to install</a>Javascript widget that displays up-to-date citations, views, and downloads for a single DOI, and links to the DataCite Search page for more detailed information.</p><h3 id="researcher-profile">Researcher Profile</h3><p>Also as part of the PARSEC project, we have built the <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-researcher-profiles">Researcher Profile</a> that, using the researcher's ORCID ID, brings all academic outputs and their metrics for a given researcher into a single dashboard. This work serves as a blueprint for other aggregations (e.g. by research organization) in the bibliometrics dashboard.</p><h3 id="bibliometrics-dashboard">Bibliometrics Dashboard</h3><p>All the services described above are required building blocks for the bibliometrics dashboard we will start working on in August. What the dashboard will add is better insights into the data citation data we have collected, primarily helping the bibliometricians in the project, but also available to other users. We will use Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analyses and to address very specific research questions, and data visualizations in the bibliometrics dashboard that address the most common questions, such as the growth of data citations over time.</p><p>The bibliometrics dashboard will expand the common DOI search service that we are currently building, beyond FREYA, which ends in November. Common DOI search, and also the bibliometrics dashboard, are built using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, not only the most popular Javascript framework right now, but also integrating very nicely with GraphQL APIs. More specifically we are using <a href="https://nextjs.org/">next.js</a> to run react on the server, helping with faster page loading and search engine optimization (SEO).</p><p>We have picked the popular <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a> library for our data visualizations. Vega is not only widely used and very flexible, but also available in versions for Jupyter notebooks (<a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html">Altair</a>) and React (<a href="https://github.com/vega/react-vega">React-Vega</a>).</p><h3 id="using-the-bibliometrics-dashboard">Using the Bibliometrics Dashboard</h3><p>DataCite members and the repositories they work with contribute to the bibliometrics dashboard in important ways, registering content with a DOI and standard metadata facilitating citation, inclusion of references in the metadata, and submission of data repository usage stats. The bibliometrics dashboard will increase our understanding of data citation and data usage stats through the bibliometrics work, but will also provide aggregations of information of interest to our members – for example data citations and data usage over time, by discipline or by repository – not available before. This information is displayed in the bibliometrics dashboard, and available via Jupyter notebooks and the GraphQL API.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/v9pp-7a27">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Fenner, M.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a blog post four weeks ago DataCite Executive Director Matt Buys talked about the DataCite strategic priorities for 2020 (Buys, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/2020-strategic-priorities-for-services-and-infrastructure/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/9j86-bv91">2020</a>). In this post we want to talk a bit more about the strategic priorities for this year we have regarding services and infrastructure work: a) consolidation of our services and infrastructure, and b) stronger emphasis on member-driven product development. They are based on the clear message we heard from our members, e.g. in the member survey that we shared yesterday (Cousijn, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/2020-strategic-priorities-for-services-and-infrastructure/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0x81-y943">2020</a>).</p><h3 id="consolidation-of-our-services-and-infrastructure">Consolidation of our services and infrastructure</h3><p>The focus of development work over the past few years has been on upgrading existing DataCite infrastructure and building new services. With the relaunch of the OAI-PMH service in December 2019 (Hallett, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/2020-strategic-priorities-for-services-and-infrastructure/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/ppth-pz62">2019</a>), we have now upgraded all major DataCite infrastructure that existed in 2015. For 2020, we want to spend more time consolidating our existing services and infrastructure, scaling back new service development, of course within the ramifications of what we promised to deliver in ongoing grants such as <a href="https://www.project-freya.eu/en">FREYA</a>. The work planned includes</p><ul><li>Better monitoring and analytics of our services, e.g. better tracking of API performance</li><li>Prioritize stability of our infrastructure, e.g. spending more time fixing bugs</li><li>Consolidate the number of services available to our members, e.g. merging the public DataCite Search into the Fabrica service</li></ul><h3 id="stronger-emphasis-on-member-driven-product-development">Stronger emphasis on member-driven product development</h3><p>This strategic priority includes two aspects: improving our process of feedback collection from DataCite members and how that informs our product development, and prioritizing our development efforts on new services or service improvements asked for by our members.</p><p>In 2020 we will improve the existing process of collecting input from our members regarding product development. These improvements will be based on how we currently collect member input via support emails, Open Hours, webinars and the DataCite General Assembly, other conversations with members, <a href="https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues">GitHub issues</a> opened by members and users, and our <a href="https://datacite.org/roadmap.html">public roadmap</a> that allows comments and upvoting.</p><p>While continuing to improve the process of collecting feedback from members, there are a number of new services or service improvements that have been consistently asked for by our members, and that we will prioritize working on in 2020. This includes improvements of the DOI registration form in Fabrica to cover all optional metadata properties, a public dump of all DOI metadata available for download, improvements to the query interface for searching for DOIs, and better support for text documents in the metadata schema (e.g. support for journal name, volume, issue, and page numbers).</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/9te8-5h68">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Buys, M.

        <updated>2020-01-20T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we launched the new version of the OAI-PMH service in November (Hallett (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-member-api/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/ppth-pz62">2019</a>)), and retired Solr (used by the old OAI-PMH service) in December, we completed the transition to Elasticsearch as our search index, and the <a href="https://api.datacite.org/">REST API</a> as our main API. All our services now integrate via Elasticsearch and the REST API, including:</p><ol><li><a href="https://mds.datacite.org/">MDS API</a> - DOI registration API</li><li><a href="https://ez.datacite.org/">EZ API</a> - DOI registration API, compatible with CDL EZID service</li><li><a href="https://doi.datacite.org/">Fabrica</a> - DOI registration and account management web interface</li><li><a href="https://oai.datacite.org/">OAI-PMH</a> - Metadata harvesting</li><li><a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite Search</a> - public DOI search</li><li><a href="https://stats.datacite.org/">Stats Portal</a> - statistics about DOI registrations and resolutions</li><li><a href="https://data.datacite.org/">Content Negotiation</a> - DOI metadata in other formats</li></ol><p>This consolidation was a lot of work in 2019, but will greatly simplify the maintenance of our services and the development of new functionality going forward.!</p><p>This consolidation of course also has its downsides, and the most important one is supporting both member services and public services via the same API. While DataCite will always make all DOI metadata available in a public API and search interface, we also have to make sure our paying members get the best possible service quality when registering DOIs or otherwise interacting with DataCite services as member.</p><p>To address this challenge we have in December split the REST API into two versions: a <strong><strong>Public API</strong></strong> and a <strong><strong>Member API</strong></strong>. These two APIs use exactly the same URLs (starting with https://api.datacite.org), run exactly the same code, and provide exactly the same public data, the only difference being that traffic is directed to a different set of servers if users authenticate as a member. This change is subtle enough that you probably have not noticed the change yet.</p><p>The launch of separate <strong><strong>Public</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Member</strong></strong> APIs allows us to monitor the uptime and response time for DataCite member services separately from our public services, and adjust as needed. We updated the <a href="https://status.datacite.org/">DataCite status page</a> to reflect this change, you can now see separate metrics (both response time and request count) for the Public API and Member API:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2020-01-20-um-10.40.10.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>There are of course other approaches to separate out member API calls from public API calls, including separate API endpoints, e.g. pub.orcid.org vs. api.orcid.org at ORCID, or separate APIs for members and non-members, e.g. the separate DOI registration API at Crossref. But we feel that our approach for accessing the member vs. public API aligns best with our strategy of offering a consolidated REST API for all services.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/ysq3-p703">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Hallett, R.

        <updated>2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DOI content negotiation is one of the oldest DataCite services, launched in 2012. Content negotiation makes it easy to fetch DataCite metadata in other metadata formats, for example <em>BibTeX</em> or <em>schema.org</em>, or as formatted citation in one of more than 5,000 citation styles. For example:</p><pre><code>curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G</code></pre><p>In 2017 we updated the service, both adding new content types (e.g. schema.org), and improving the support for existing content types (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/changes-to-doi-content-negotiation/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-01qj">2017</a>).</p><p>In 2018 we launched a new version of the REST API (Dasler, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/changes-to-doi-content-negotiation/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/s8rt-zv48">2018</a>) that complements content negotiation: you can now submit metadata in most of the metadata formats supported by content negotiation to register a DOI.</p><p>With this blog post we want to announce an important upcoming change to DataCite DOI content negotiation that addresses a long-standing issue. Content negotiation is used to provide different representations of the same resource in different formats. What content negotiation is not is a protocol to return the content itself described by the DOI instead of the metadata describing the content, e.g. a PDF or CSV file. The initial implementation of DataCite DOI content negotiation didn't make that clear distinction and allows registration of custom content types, including those that typically are associated with content rather than metadata, e.g. <code>application/pdf</code>. Registration of custom content types is still possible with the current version of the service, but we are today announcing that we will retire this functionality on January 1st, 2020.</p><p>We know that many organizations make heavy use of custom content types for DataCite DOIs, so we provide both a long transition period and alternative approaches to achieve the same.</p><p>On October 1st, 2019 we will retire support for custom content types via the DOI resolver <code>https://doi.org</code>. You can continue to use custom content types by using the DataCite content negotiation service at data.datacite.org directly, e.g.</p><pre><code>curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://data.datacite.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G</code></pre><p>Starting January 1st, 2020 custom content types will no longer be supported.</p><p>There are two alternatives to using custom content types in content negotiation:</p><ul><li>use the REST API, specifically the <code>/media</code> API endpoint to access exactly the information currently made available via content negotiation</li><li>use content negotiation at the landing page for the resource that the DOI resolves to. DataCite content negotiation is forwarding all requests with unknown content types to the URL registered in the handle system.</li></ul><p>Going forward, the upcoming changes will lead to improvements in two areas:</p><ul><li>the content negotiation service will become faster, easier to maintain, and more aligned with other DOI registration agencies such as Crossref. The new service is already running at https://data.crosscite.org.</li><li>we can improve the workflows for registering URLs to content in the DOI registration service. This will enable direct access to content, and will improve machine access to data.</li></ul><p>Please read our <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-content-resolver">support documentation for content negotiation</a> for more details, or reach out to <a href="mailto:support@datacite.org">DataCite support</a> if you need help transitioning from custom content types you have registered in the past.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/nz0m-rb06">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Dasler, R.

        <updated>2019-07-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The connections between scholarly resources generated by persistent identifiers (PIDs) and associated metadata form a graph: the PID Graph [Fenner &amp; Aryani (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/tracking-the-growth-of-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/jwvf-8a66">2019</a>)]. We developed this PID Graph concept in the EC-funded <a href="https://www.project-freya.eu/en">FREYA project</a>, and have identified important use cases and technical requirements. In May, DataCite introduced a GraphQL API to standardize and simplify how users can contribute to and consume the PID Graph [Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/tracking-the-growth-of-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/qab1-n315">2019b</a>)]. Today we are announcing another important milestone: we added the required functionality to the DataCite GraphQL API that allows us to keep track of the growth of the PID Graph in terms of nodes (resources) and edges (connections). As before, we are using a Jupyter notebook to analyze and visualize the data.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/download-19-.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Number of nodes and connections in the PID Graph" loading="lazy" title="PID Graph: number of nodes and connections"></figure><p><strong><strong>Number of nodes and connections in the PID Graph</strong></strong></p><p>The graph visualizes the main resources currently available via the DataCite GraphQL API, and their connections. The required data are fetched via a single GraphQL API call:</p><pre><code>{
  publications {
    totalCount
    publicationConnectionCount
    datasetConnectionCount
    softwareConnectionCount
    researcherConnectionCount
    funderConnectionCount
  }
  datasets {
    totalCount
    datasetConnectionCount
    softwareConnectionCount
    researcherConnectionCount
    funderConnectionCount
  }
  softwares {
    totalCount
    softwareConnectionCount
    researcherConnectionCount
    funderConnectionCount
  }
  researchers {
    totalCount
  }
  funders {
    totalCount
  }
}</code></pre><p>The numbers reflect what is currently available via the DataCite GraphQL API, not the total number of publications, datasets, etc. with persistent identifiers and linking metadata. This includes all publications, datasets and software with DataCite DOIs, all funders in the <a href="https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214360886-The-Open-Funder-Registry">Crossref Open Funder Registry</a>, publications with Crossref DOIs linked to at least one DataCite DOI, and all researchers with an ORCID identifier linked to at least one DataCite DOI. A lot of work remains to be done to include the other resources with persistent identifiers made available by FREYA partners, including Crossref, ORCID and EMBL-EBI, as well as their connections. With this new API functionality we can now track the growth of the PID Graph with the key performance indicators (KPIs) number of <strong><strong>nodes</strong></strong> and number of <strong><strong>connections</strong></strong>.</p><p>A few interesting observations can be made from the visualization: not surprisingly, given that datasets currently make up the largest number of resources in the PID Graph, by far the largest number of connections (9.4 million) is between datasets and other datasets. Looking at the relation type of these connections in the Event Data API, most of them (8.5 million) don't describe versioning or granularity (HasPart/IsPartOf relations), but use the relation type <strong><strong>references</strong></strong> between two <a href="https://www.gbif.org/en/">GBIF</a> DOIs. This reflects the main <a href="https://www.gbif.org/en/document/81771/gbif-overview-powerpoint-slides">use case for DOIs at GBIF</a>, tracking occurrences of species.</p><p>The graph shows 1.5 million connections between publications and datasets, representing the data citations made available via the <a href="https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/app-scholix/">Crossref/DataCite Event Data Scholix API endpoint</a>. Twenty-five percent of datasets with DataCite DOIs have been referenced in the scholarly literature, according to this graph. We also see the number software citations using DataCite DOIs for software found in the scholarly literature, and we can use this API call to keep track of them. Similarly, we can track the number of datasets, publications and software linked to researchers (via their ORCID ID), and funding (via the Crossref Funder ID), but keep in mind that connections to researchers and funding via Crossref are still missing.</p><p>The Jupyter notebook used to generate the visualization shown here is available via GitHub, where we store all PID Graph notebooks in a <a href="https://github.com/datacite/notebooks">central repository</a>. Starting with this notebook [Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/tracking-the-growth-of-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.14454/3bpw-w381">2019a</a>)] we are also issuing DOIs for the notebooks, which we generate using a <a href="https://codemeta.github.io/">codemeta</a> file hosted in the same folder as the notebook. This should make these notebooks easier to discover, and they also become part of the PID Graph.</p><p>Going forward we want to refine the GraphQL API to provide the numbers of <strong><strong>nodes</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>connections</strong></strong> as they change over time, making it easier to track progress. And of course we will be adding more resource types and information from other FREYA partners.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago DataCite announced the pre-release version of a GraphQL API [Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/using-jupyter-notebooks-with-graphql-and-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/qab1-n315">2019</a>)]. GraphQL simplifies complex queries that for example want to retrieve information about the authors, funding and data citations for a dataset with a DataCite DOI. These connections together form the PID Graph [Fenner &amp; Aryani (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/using-jupyter-notebooks-with-graphql-and-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/jwvf-8a66">2019</a>)], and DataCite is working with the other partners in the EC-funded <a href="https://www.project-freya.eu/">FREYA project</a> on making it easier to contribute to the PID Graph, and consume information in the PID Graph.</p><p><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a> are a very popular web-based interactive computational environment and are the perfect platform to explore the PID Graph via GraphQL APIs. Since interactions with GraphQL APIs are standardized and GraphQL libraries exist for many programming languages supported by Jupyter notebooks, all the user has to do is come up with interesting queries and process the information returned from the API as JSON, following exactly the format of the query.</p><p>An example notebook can best explain this. We have created a GitHub repository for notebooks using the GraphQL API at <a href="https://github.com/datacite/notebooks">https://github.com/datacite/notebooks</a>, and you find <a href="https://github.com/datacite/notebooks/blob/master/pid-graph/r-person-publications/r-person-publications.ipynb">this notebook</a> in there. Open the notebook in your favorite Jupyter client (e.g. <a href="https://nteract.io/">nteract</a>) or look at it directly in GitHub.</p><p>The GraphQL query in the notebook is as follows:</p><pre><code>{
  researcher(id: "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-2405") {
    id
    name
    publications(first: 50) {
      totalCount
      nodes {
        id
        relatedIdentifiers {
          relatedIdentifier
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>This query will return the first 50 publications with DataCite DOIs linked to my ORCID ID, together with information about content referenced by these publications. The Jupyter notebook is then processing the JSON API response with two major outputs:</p><ul><li>two reference lists of all publications, and of all their references, using the APA citation style and the <a href="https://citation.crosscite.org/">DOI citation formatter service</a>.</li><li>a network graph of all publications and their references (blue circles), with a node (green circle) representing the author of these publications (me):</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/download-3-.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Force-directed graph of publications by a particular researcher and their references"></figure><p>Even with only 50 publications the graph already is rather complicated. Many of my publications with DataCite DOIs are for the DataCite Blog, and you see them connected to a blue node in the top part of the graph. In the lower left corner you see a blog post with an unusually high number of references (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/using-jupyter-notebooks-with-graphql-and-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/ct8b-x1ce">2016</a>). A number of publications appear as pairs linked to each other, reflecting the figshare approach to versioning.</p><p>This is only the starting point of what can be done with Jupyter notebooks and GraphQL, but it is clear that the possibilities are almost endless. You can use the above notebook as a starting point, e.g. to generate the graph of publications (with DataCite DOIs) using your ORCID ID. Or you do something very different, or use Python instead of R as programming language. You can of course contribute interesting notebooks to the above GitHub repository using a pull request.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/hwaw-xe52">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Fenner, M.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DataCite DOIs describe resources such as datasets, samples, software and publications with rich metadata. An important part of this metadata is the description of connections between resources that use persistent identifiers (PIDs) provided by DataCite and others (Crossref, ORCID, ROR, ISNI, IGSN, etc.). Together these resources and their connections form a graph, the PID Graph (Fenner &amp; Aryani, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/graphql-api-pre-release/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/jwvf-8a66">2019</a>).</p><p>Accessing information available in this PID Graph, while preserving the rich connections between resources, is not trivial, and the JSON REST APIs that most PID service providers including DataCite are providing to users, while having a very good track record allowing users to access a single resource or a list of similar resources, might not be the best fit for more complex queries of the PID Graph.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>, a query language that uses a graph as the underlying data model and aligns well with the kinds of queries that need to be supported in the PID Graph. GraphQL was started by Facebook in 2012, made available as Open Source software in 2015, and in 2019 has become a mainstream technology with broad support in terms of <a href="https://graphql.org/code/">libraries, tools and services</a>.</p><p>Today DataCite is announcing the pre-release version of the DataCite GraphQL API, and we invite you to try it out at <a href="https://api.datacite.org/graphql">https://api.datacite.org/graphql</a>. GraphQL works very differently from the REST APIs that most of us are familiar with: you need a special client application (e.g. <a href="https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql">this one</a> or <a href="https://www.graphqlbin.com/">this one</a>) to use a GraphQL API, and all API calls are done to the same URL and using the POST method.</p><p>A typical starting point for a query in the PID Graph using GraphQL is a resource such as a dataset, researcher, organization, etc. identified by it's PID. For example:</p><pre><code>{
  dataset(id: "https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/nfzli3/cynkam") {
    titles {
      title
    }
  }
}</code></pre><pre><code>{
  publication(id: "https://doi.org/10.5438/jwvf-8a66") {
    titles {
      title
    }
  }
}</code></pre><pre><code>{
  software(id: "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1013940") {
    titles {
      title
    }
  }
}</code></pre><pre><code>{
  researcher(id: "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1642-628X") {
    givenName
    familyName
  }
}</code></pre><pre><code>{
  organization(id: "https://ror.org/05rrcem69") {
    name
  }
}</code></pre><p>Some of these PIDs are obviously not provided by DataCite, but the DataCite GraphQL supports them as well via a wrapper layer over, for example, the <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR</a> API.</p><p>GraphQL allows you to specify exactly the fields the query should return, including linked resources. For example all publications (with a DataCite DOI) authored by a particular researcher, and including the titles and relatedIdentifiers for those publications:</p><pre><code>{
  researcher(id: "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4695-7874") {
    id
    name
    givenName
    familyName
    publications {
      totalCount
      edges {
        node {
          id
          titles {
            title
          }
          relatedIdentifiers {
            relationType
            relatedIdentifier
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>In addition to retrieving a specific resource using the PID, you can also do queries. For resources with DOIs, the query syntax is exactly the same as in DataCite Search or DOI Fabrica. For example:</p><pre><code>{
  softwares(query: "subjects.subject:python") {
    totalCount
    
    nodes {
      id
      titles {
        title
      }
      fundingReferences {
        funderIdentifier
        funderName
        awardTitle
        awardNumber
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efvxGfU_oVM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 97, 91); font-family: Raleway, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"></iframe></figure><p>After this short introduction it should have become clearer how GraphQL works differently from your typical REST API, and that GraphQL is a perfect fit for the kinds of queries one might want to do with the PID Graph. Now that you have had an introduction to the DataCite GraphQL API, you can try your own queries.</p><p>The DataCite GraphQL API is a pre-release version, which means it's not yet final. It may contain bugs or might be missing functionality you expect. In particular more complex queries of the PID Graph are not yet supported. Your feedback is valuable for improving the API, so we encourage you to try it out and let us know what you think. Please use the <a href="https://www.pidforum.org/c/pid-graph">PID Graph section in the PID Forum</a> to ask questions or suggest features. We'll keep updating the API, and we aim to get a final release out sometime later this year.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/qab1-n315">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Fenner, M., &amp; Aryani, A.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DOI metadata provenance is describing the history of a particular DOI metadata record, i.e. what changes were made when and by whom. This information is now stored and provided via an API for all DOI registrations since March 10, 2019.</p><p>The following provenance information is now available via a new <code>/activities</code> REST API endpoint:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>prov:wasGeneratedBy</strong></strong>. The unique identifier for the activity making changes to a DOI record.</li><li><strong><strong>prov:generatedAtTime</strong></strong>. Timestamp of the activity.</li><li><strong><strong>prov:wasDerivedFrom</strong></strong>. The DOI for which the changes are being tracked.</li><li><strong><strong>prov:wasAttributedTo</strong></strong>. The client or provider account responsible for the changes.</li><li><strong><strong>action</strong></strong>. Can be either create, update or delete.</li><li><strong><strong>version</strong></strong>. Version number for the DOI record.</li><li><strong><strong>changes</strong></strong>. Changes made to DOI metadata, broken down by attribute, with both old and new value.</li></ul><p>The main use case is more transparency about changes to DOI metadata, including changes of the URL. You will for example be able to see the provenance for the DOI metadata for this blog post via <em>https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.5438/wy92-xj57/activities</em>. This is mainly useful if something goes wrong, but for example helps explain why a DOI record sometimes has a new <code>updated date</code> even though the member didn't make any changes (the most likely reason is that we stored <a href="https://support.datacite.org/docs/link-checker">link checker</a> results and you would see that in the provenance record).</p><p>We have captured more than 3.6 million activities around DOI metadata records since starting this new service in March. Going forward, we will enhance the functionality, e.g. by providing the same information in DOI Fabrica in addition to the API. Tracking the provenance also allows users to revert changes that were made inadvertently, and it allows DataCite to build services that are triggered when a particular change is made to DOI metadata.</p><p>This work has been done as part of the <a href="https://www.project-freya.eu/en/about/mission">FREYA project</a>, which aims to expand the technical and social infrastructure for persistent identifiers in Europe.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Persistent identifiers (PIDs) are not only important to uniquely identify a publication, dataset, or person, but the metadata for these persistent identifiers can provide unambiguous linking between persistent identifiers of the same type, e.g. journal articles citing other journal articles, or of different types, e.g. linking a researcher and the datasets they produced.</p><p>Work is needed to connect existing persistent identifiers to each other in standardized ways, e.g. to the outputs associated with a particular researcher, repository, institution or funder, for discovery and impact assessment. Some of the more complex but still important use cases can’t be addressed by simply collecting and aggregating links between two persistent identifiers, including</p><ol><li>Aggregate the citations for all versions of a dataset or software source code</li><li>Aggregate the citations for all datasets hosted in a particular repository, funded by a particular funder, or created by a particular researcher</li><li>Aggregate all citations for a <a href="http://www.researchobject.org/">research object</a>: a publication, the data underlying the findings in the paper, and the software, samples, and reagents used to create those datasets.</li></ol><p>To address these use cases we need a more complex model to describe the resources that are identified by PIDs, and the connections between them: a graph. In graph theory, the resources identified by PIDs correspond to the nodes in this graph, and the connections between PIDs correspond to the edges.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/pid_graph_image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Fig 1.

A schematic representation of the PID graph with digital objects connected by PIDs, showing three use cases: A: Different versions of software code, B: Datasets hosted by a particular repository, C: All digital objects connected to a research object.</p><p>Using a graph makes it easier to describe these more complex use cases and relationships, and this approach has been frequently applied to similar questions in the past. FREYA builds on the expertise and close collaboration with the <a href="http://researchgraph.org/">Research Graph</a> team and adopts the outputs of the <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-description-registry-interoperability.html">Research Data Alliance DDRI Working group</a> to transform PID connections into an improved graph of research objects. This project takes advantage of the best practices of graph modelling and distributed network analysis techniques. We call this the <strong><strong>PID Graph</strong></strong>.</p><h3 id="pid-graph-use-cases">PID Graph Use Cases</h3><p>Before starting work on implementing the PID Graph, the FREYA partners collected user stories from their communities relevant to the PID Graph work. We used GitHub issues in a public repository for this activity and then met in person in August 2018 to clarify, group and prioritize these user stories. In total, we identified 48 user stories, described <a href="https://github.com/datacite/freya/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PID+Graph%22++label%3A%22user+story%22+">here</a>. The main outcomes of the August 2018 workshop were:</p><ol><li>There is a significant number of relevant user stories that can only be addressed by implementing a PID Graph.</li><li>While there is a diverse number of stakeholder groups and persistent identifier types in these user stories, a number of common themes and major use cases emerged in the workshop.</li><li>We didn’t identify any uses cases that require more than two connections between PIDs, simplifying the required implementation work needed.</li></ol><p>After identifying and describing the most relevant use cases, summarized above, we started the implementation work for the FREYA PID Graph. Our goal was to implement the PID Graph as standard production service rather than a research activity or pilot service, so scalability and maintainability are of utmost importance. We learned a lot from the extensive experience gained in the <a href="http://researchgraph.org/">Research Graph</a> initiative and decided to build PID Graph using a set of federated RESTful JSON APIs. PID Graph will not be a single service but federated between FREYA PID providers, FREYA disciplinary partners, and organizations outside of FREYA. PID Graph will be provided by <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">RESTful JSON APIs</a> that describe the resources (nodes) and connections (edges) in this graph. All FREYA PID providers use RESTful JSON APIs to provide PID metadata so that this approach aligns with the extensive existing infrastructure.</p><h3 id="initial-pid-graph-implementation">Initial PID Graph Implementation</h3><p>The first working PID Graph implementation is provided by DataCite, extending the existing Event Data Service (Dasler &amp; Cousijn, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/s6d3-k860">2018</a>), a collaboration between Crossref and DataCite. Event Data is a service that provides connections (here called events) between PIDs and other resources, with an initial focus on social media mentions and data citations. The initial PID Graph work done by DataCite since the August 2018 workshop has added these functionalities to <a href="https://datacite.org/eventdata.html">DataCite Event Data</a>:</p><h4 id="include-metadata-about-resources">Include metadata about resources</h4><p>Include not only metadata about connections but also metadata about the resources identified by PIDs. This dramatically simplifies the API calls needed to construct a PID Graph. We do this by optionally including the metadata for the <strong><strong>subj</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>obj</strong></strong> (the resources linked via the event) in Event Data via an extra query parameter: <a href="https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj</a></p><p>Including the metadata for subj and obj also enables queries based on resource metadata, e.g. query by type of content that is connected: <a href="https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;citationType=ScholarlyArticle-SoftwareSourceCode">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;citationType=ScholarlyArticle-SoftwareSourceCode</a></p><p>This query today returns 1,078 events connecting scholarly articles and software, including 834 from journal articles referencing software via Crossref metadata and 210 from software referencing journal articles via DataCite metadata.</p><h4 id="include-implicit-relations-in-metadata-about-resources">Include implicit relations in metadata about resources</h4><p>Metadata for resources contain a lot of information about connected PIDs. We can take advantage of this by including the information in DataCite Event Data, allowing queries that in effect connect two PIDs via an intermediary resource and two connections. Specifically, we include these relations and associated PIDs:</p><ol><li>Version, e.g. dataset A <strong><strong>isVersionOf</strong></strong> dataset B (using DataCite <strong><strong>relatedIdentifier</strong></strong> metadata)</li><li>Granularity, e.g. dataset A <strong><strong>isPartOf</strong></strong> dataset B or dataset A <strong><strong>isSupplementTo</strong></strong> article B (using DataCite <strong><strong>relatedIdentifier</strong></strong> metadata)</li><li>Funding, e.g. dataset A <strong><strong>isFundedBy</strong></strong> funder B (using DataCite <strong><strong>fundingReferences</strong></strong> metadata)</li><li>Author, e.g. dataset A <strong><strong>isAuthoredBy </strong></strong>author B (using DataCite <strong><strong>nameIdentifier</strong></strong> metadata)</li></ol><p>These connected PIDs can then act as a <strong><strong>proxy</strong></strong> in PID Graph queries, as demonstrated in this example:</p><p><a href="https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.5061/dryad.k5k9074">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.5061/dryad.k5k9074</a></p><p>The query today returns one data citation of the dataset identified by the DOI, and eight data files that are part of this dataset. If someone decides to cite one of these data files instead of the dataset (following principle 8 Specificity and Verifiability of the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (Data Citation Synthesis Group, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk">2014</a>)), that data citation would also be included in the DataCite Event Data response.</p><p>Similarly, the citation of a specific version of a dataset would be included if querying for the parent version of the dataset. Examples for funding and authorship are given in the next paragraph.</p><h4 id="include-more-types-of-events">Include more types of events</h4><p>The initial focus in Event Data was on social media mentions and data citations. DataCite has added author-resource links and funder-resource links, using ORCID and Crossref Funder ID as PIDs, respectively. DataCite also include dataset usage statistics, as part of the work in the Make Data Count (Lowenberg, Budden, &amp; Cruse, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/pre3-2f25">2018</a>) project. This enables the following two use cases:</p><ol><li>Show all datasets created by a particular researcher and their usage stats <a href="https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;orcid=0000-0002-1194-1055">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;orcid=0000-0002-1194-1055</a>. The query today returns four datasets created by a researcher identified via her ORCID ID, plus a combined 21 unique views of these datasets in February and March 2019.</li><li>Show all datasets funded by the European Commission that have been cited by a journal article <a href="https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.13039/501100000780&amp;citation-type=Dataset-ScholarlyArticle">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.13039/501100000780&amp;citation-type=Dataset-ScholarlyArticle</a>.

        <updated>2019-01-07T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we are announcing our first new functionality of 2019, a much improved search for DataCite DOIs and metadata. While the <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite Search</a> user interface has not changed, changes under the hood bring many important improvements and are our biggest changes to search since 2012.</p><h2 id="faster-indexing">Faster Indexing</h2><p>Newly registered (and tagged findable) DOIs now appear in the DataCite Search index within a few minutes, compared with the previous up to 12 hour lag. The same is true for metadata updates or DOIs removed from the public search index (by changing the DOI state from <strong><strong>findable</strong></strong> to <strong><strong>registered</strong></strong>). Faster indexing is particularly important when related content is published at the same time, e.g. a dataset with a DataCite DOI associated with a journal article with a Crossref DOI.</p><h2 id="advanced-doi-search-in-doi-fabrica">Advanced DOI Search in DOI Fabrica</h2><p>This faster indexing makes it possible for members and clients to use the Search index also in <a href="https://doi.datacite.org/">DOI Fabrica</a>, enabling the same advanced search functionality available in DataCite Search, but also including DOIs in <strong><strong>draft</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>registered</strong></strong> state. Our Solr search index could not be used in DOI Fabrica, as users would not see newly created or updated DOIs because of the indexing delay. This makes it much easier to manage DOIs and associated metadata, e.g. by filtering for DOIs in draft state or finding DOIs using the retired metadata schemata 2.1 and 2.2. And it is the first time that we provide DOI registration and search in a single user interface; this kind of simplification is one of our themes for 2019 [Dasler (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/improving-search/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/bckb-qy95">2018</a>)].</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2019-01-05-um-17.30.20.png" class="kg-image" alt="Query for research data management" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Query for research data management</figcaption></figure><h2 id="search-for-everything">Search for Everything</h2><p>Our new search index covers all metadata and allows specific searches of every metadata field. For example <strong><strong>geoLocationPlace</strong></strong>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2019-01-05-um-17.40.47.png" class="kg-image" alt="Search for geoLocationPlace Cuba" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Search for geoLocationPlace Cuba</figcaption></figure><p>The supported search syntax is very similar to what was available before, and uses the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax">Elasticsearch Query String Syntax</a>. You can for example specify field names, use wildcards, regular expressions, ranges, and boolean operators, e.g. use <code>creators.affiliation:stanford +creators.affiliation:ucsf</code> to find the 174 DOIs with collaborators from both of these two institutions.</p><h2 id="it-solves-the-deep-paging-problem">It Solves the Deep Paging Problem</h2><p>One important limitation of our previous search index, and a common issue with many search implementations, was the <a href="https://solr.pl/en/2011/07/18/deep-paging-problem/">deep paging problem</a>, making it hard if not impossible to fetch a very large number of results. Our new search index supports cursor-based pagination that overcomes this problem, allowing users to, for example, harvest all DOI metadata from a particular member. This is done in the REST API, specifying a larger number of records per page – e.g. <code>https://api.datacite.org/providers/caltech/dois?page[size]=1000</code> – and the using the URL provided via <code>links.next</code> in the API response for the next query.</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><p>The above changes were made possible by updating our search index service from an old version of Solr (4.0) to a recent version of Elasticsearch (6.3). We switched to Elasticsearch, as it works better with our new JSON-based workflow – see our December blog post about JSON [Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/improving-search/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/1pca-1y05">2018</a>)] – and we can use a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">hosted service</a> tightly integrated with the rest of our infrastructure thereby reducing the support effort needed.</p><h2 id="next">Next</h2><p>Not all DataCite services have been switched to the new search index, the <a href="https://stats.datacite.org/">Stats Portal</a> and <a href="https://oai.datacite.org/">OAI-PMH</a> service will be migrated within the next three months and continue to use the old Solr search index for now.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months we will also provide better documentation, and improve performance and fix any bugs we encounter. We will also work with our members to better understand what kind of queries they are most interested in, and how we can better support these queries in the search interface.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/vyd9-ty64">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Dasler, R.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All DataCite DOIs have associated metadata, described in the DataCite Metadata Schema Documentation (DataCite Metadata Working Group (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-datacite-json/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0014">2017</a>)), validated and stored as XML in the DataCite Metadata Store (MDS). These metadata are then made available via DataCite APIs and services. For these services XML is not always the best format, and we are thus providing the metadata in other formats, most notably JSON. The problem with our approach so far has been that this JSON was not properly defined, creating overhead and ambiguity both for our internal services and for our users. To change this situation, and to make it easier to work with metadata for DataCite DOIs, we today are announcing <strong><strong>DataCite JSON</strong></strong>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/uploads/bildschirmfoto-2018-12-19-um-15.36.18.png" class="kg-image" alt="Google Trends: Searches for XML API (red) vs. JSON API (blue)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Google Trends: Searches for XML API (red) vs. JSON API (blue)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="what-is-datacite-json">What is DataCite JSON?</h3><p>DataCite JSON represents all metadata elements and attributes available in DataCite XML, and can be converted from and to DataCite XML via several DataCite services (MDS API, EZ API, DOI Fabrica, Content Negotiation) that internally all use the bolognese metadata conversion library (Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-datacite-json/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/n138-z3mk">2017</a>)), which also provides a command-line utility. Both our new Elasticsearch Search index and the updated JSON REST API (more on those in another blog post) use DataCite JSON. The bolognese metadata conversion library uses DataCite JSON as the intermediary format, for example when converting BibTeX to schema.org JSON-LD or JATS XML.</p><h2 id="is-datacite-json-different-from-datacite-xml">Is DataCite JSON different from DataCite XML?</h2><p>There are minor differences between DataCite JSON and DataCite XML, mainly to make working with the metadata easier. This includes an <strong><strong>identifiers</strong></strong> object that combines the <strong><strong>identifier</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>alternateIdentifier</strong></strong> properties, and a <strong><strong>types</strong></strong> object that not only stores <strong><strong>resourceTypeGeneral</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>resourceType</strong></strong> information, but also the type information from RIS, BibTeX, Citeproc and schema.org, to avoid losing type information when converting between these formats. There is also a new <strong><strong>container</strong></strong> property that stores information about the repository or journal where the content is located. We can provide this information in DataCite XML via the relatedidentifier (with relationType <strong><strong>isPartOf</strong></strong>) and description (via descriptionType <strong><strong>SeriesInformation</strong></strong>) elements, but the process is cumbersome. DataCite JSON also includes information not available in DataCite XML, including the url registered for the DOI, and the date the DOI was registered.</p><h2 id="do-you-have-examples-using-datacite-json">Do you have examples using DataCite JSON?</h2><p>To see DataCite JSON in action, lookup the DOI metadata of your favorite DOI in our JSON REST API, e.g. <a href="https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.5438/0014">https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.5438/0014</a>, or - if you are a DataCite member or client - in <a href="https://doi.datacite.org/">DOI Fabrica</a>. Alternatively install bolognese (via <code>gem install bolognese</code>) and fetch metadata via the command <code>bolognese 10.5438/0014 -t datacite_json</code>. Documentation of DataCite JSON is unfortunately still sparse, in early 2019 we will provide better documentation via our <a href="https://support.datacite.org/">support site</a>, and this will also include updated documentation of the JSON REST API and a JSON Schema to validate the metadata, aligned with our XSD Schema for DataCite XML.</p><p>We hope that DataCite JSON makes it easier to work with DataCite metadata, helping to improve metadata quality and re-use. We encourage users to adapt their tools to take advantage of DataCite JSON, and to consider DataCite JSON also when working with metadata not associated with a DataCite DOI, but when a description of scholarly resources with standard metadata and using JSON is needed.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We know that software is important in research, and some of us in the scholarly communications community, for example, <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group">in FORCE11</a>, have been pushing the concept of software citation as a method to allow software developers and maintainers to get academic credit for their work: software releases are published and assigned DOIs, and software users then cite these releases when they publish research that uses the software.</p><p>DataCite recently examined the DOIs that have been created for software, and found that the number of new DOIs created for software is growing roughly exponentially, now reaching about 2000 software DOIs per month, with spikes of around 4000 per month in some of 2017. The data and results are shown here. The source code for the R script used to generate the data and figures is available (Fenner, Katz, Smith, &amp; Nielsen (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/doi-registrations-software/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/wr0x-e194">2018</a>)).</p><p>As of May 16, 2018, <a href="https://search.datacite.org/works?resource-type-id=software">58,301 DOIs</a> have been registered for software.

There appears to be a change of in the rate of growth around this time as well.</p><h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2><p>We see a nice exponential growth in the number of DOIs for software, and we don't expect this to change in 2018 and beyond. The <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group">FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group</a> is working on implementation and adoption of the Software Citation Principles, and for a number of use cases, e.g., citation in a journal article, DOIs play an important role. The working group also tries to address the challenges in using DOIs as identifiers for software that still exist, and what is done to resolve them, including pre-registration APIs to smooth the automated push-style deposit; better semantic linkage supported by extensions to the DataCite schema, and group/collective/microcitation DOI use.</p><p>We expect initiatives such as <a href="http://citation-file-format.github.io/citation-file-format/">Citation File Format</a> and <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/">Software Heritage</a> to have a positive impact on the number of DOIs for software.

(<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/doi-registrations-software/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5063/schema/codemeta-2.0">2017</a>)) is particularly relevant; this new standard for software metadata simplifies the crosswalk between the wide variety of metadata standards for software, and is increasingly integrated into DOI registration workflows, including the CaltechDATA repository since <a href="https://www.library.caltech.edu/news/enhanced-software-preservation-now-available-caltechdata">March 2018</a>, the DataCite DOI registration service since May 2018 (Fenner (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/doi-registrations-software/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/cxe5-rg55">2018</a>), Dasler (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/doi-registrations-software/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0yk5-b755">2018</a>)) and is planned for the Zenodo/GitHub integration in autumn 2018.

        <updated>2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today DataCite is launching <a href="https://doi.datacite.org/">DOI Fabrica</a>, the next generation of DataCite’s DOI registration service, replacing the Metadata Store (<a href="https://mds.datacite.org/">MDS</a>). This is the biggest and most important product release DataCite has done in many years, and the result of nine months of hard work by the entire DataCite team.</p><p>DOI registration is the core service that DataCite is providing to its members and the data centers they work with. The requirements for how DOI registration should work have changed significantly since the Metadata Store was originally launched in 2011. We began the DOI Fabrica project in early 2017 by collecting, categorizing, and prioritizing user stories for what is needed from the DataCite DOI registration service. Central to this activity was continuously engaging with our members and the DataCite community to make sure their needs were met. As part of this work, we rethought how we work with user stories and how develop our product roadmap (more details in <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/roadmap/">this</a> blog post), and you can find all user stories directly relevant for DOI registration <a href="https://www.datacite.org/user-stories.html?=&amp;category=create#how-to-provide-feedback">here</a>.</p><p>Once it was clear that significant work was needed to improve the existing DOI registration service, and that incremental changes of the Metadata Store wouldn’t be enough, we thought about how to best approach the development of a new service. The following principles guided us:</p><ul><li>Implement and constantly improve a feedback process that can guide our development. In addition to the user stories and roadmap we also worked closely with the <a href="https://www.datacite.org/steering.html">DataCite Services and Technology Steering Group</a> that was launched in September 2016.</li><li>Do gradual, small changes as much as possible to reduce the risk of failures or significant delays – we have all experienced this with scholarly infrastructure projects. DOI Fabrica focusses on changes in the user interface, and we have left the MDS API unchanged for now.</li><li>Re-architect the existing DOI registration service into smaller, loosely coupled services to simplify maintenance and improvements. DOI Fabrica consists of one frontend service, one authentication service, and two APIs (the legacy MDS API plus a new API for managing members and data centers).</li><li>Make it easy to run the code in development, deploy code changes and receive automatic error messages. This includes continuous integration tools for automatically running tests after commits to the code repository.</li><li>Build user interfaces that engage users, and provide clear documentation and mechanisms to provide feedback.</li></ul><p>What do all of the above have in common? They make the product development process faster, broken down into smaller steps, and more focused on what our members and users really care about. The most important feature of DOI Fabrica is thus the ongoing development it enables going forward, and you can expect important new functionality in the next few months (check our <a href="https://www.datacite.org/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> for details and/or if you want to provide feedback). But of course, this first DOI Fabrica release comes with functionality directly addressing the needs identified in the user stories collected earlier this year. We want to highlight how we addressed five of these user stories:</p><h3 id="single-sign-on"><a href="https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues/132">Single Sign-on</a></h3><p><em>As a member or data center, I want a single username/password to access all DataCite services, so that I don't spend extra time managing access.</em></p><p>We have consolidated all login options for users into a single service, <a href="https://profiles.datacite.org/">DataCite Profiles</a>, and defined roles and permissions for DOI Fabrica. To not break existing integrations, the MDS API will continue to use the old username/password authentication.</p><h3 id="powerful-mds-admin-user-interface-ui"><a href="https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues/56">Powerful MDS Admin User Interface (UI)</a></h3><p><em>As a member, I want a powerful admin UI (prefix transfer from one datacenter to another, editing/hiding the welcome email to data centers, expand the length of the field “domain” etc.) to manage all my data centers so that I reduce admin costs and can track changes.</em></p><p>All functionality relevant for DOI registration (including management of data centers and prefixes) is now available via API calls. DOI Fabrica provides a powerful administrator UI that, for example, allows members to automatically fetch new prefixes from the DataCite pool when all their prefixes are in use, instead of sending an email to DataCite support.</p><h3 id="link-checker-reports"><a href="https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues/11">Link checker reports</a></h3><p><em>As a national library, I want services that check DOI resolution (broken links), so I can keep my responsibilities of persistence.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2017/10/link-checking.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>DOI Fabrica includes a simple link checker that is particularly useful during DOI registration. A more robust link checker is on our <a href="https://www.datacite.org/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> for the coming months.</p><h3 id="reporting-tool"><a href="https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues/52">Reporting tool</a></h3><p><em>As a member, I want a reporting tool, so that I can stay informed about my DOIs.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2017/10/stats.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>While future DOI Fabrica releases will provide much more detailed reporting, with this release members will see a dashboard that summarizes the numbers of data centers (clients) they work with, and the number of DOIs registered per year.</p><h3 id="dois-per-discipline"><a href="https://github.com/datacite/datacite/issues/68">DOIs per discipline</a></h3><p><em>As a national library, I want to see how many datasets exist per discipline, so that I can decide about resourcing.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2017/10/re3data.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>We are still a long way from understanding how many DOIs for research data exist per discipline, but we took an important first step by enabling the linking of data centers to <a href="https://www.re3data.org/">re3data</a>, allowing us to automatically pull in information about the disciplines covered in any particular repository.</p><p>With so many changes in DOI Fabrica we couldn’t include everything we wanted in the first release, and one functionality in particular has to wait for the next release in six weeks: DOI registration. We need to first address technical dependencies before this can be implemented, and rather than delaying the first release of DOI Fabrica, we decided to focus on functionality important for our members, and to add DOI registration via XML upload and web form in the next release. We look forward to your feedback and to suggestions on how we can improve <a href="https://doi.datacite.org/">DOI Fabrica</a>.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/g7q1-7t10">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/a-content-negotiation-update"/>
        <updated>2017-04-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While it is a best practice for DOIs (expressed as URL) to send the user to the landing page for that resource (Starr et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/content-negotiation-update/#ref-https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1">2015</a>), sometimes we want something else: <strong><strong>metadata</strong></strong>, e.g. to generate a citation, or to go to the <strong><strong>content</strong></strong> itself. The easiest way to do that is to use DOI content negotiation.</p><p>In this blog post we will give an introduction to DOI content negotiation, describe some of the issues we identified with our current implementation, and announce a major service update addressing these issues and launching in two weeks.</p><p>DOI Content Negotiation uses the HTTP <strong><strong>Accept</strong></strong> header together with the DOI expressed as URL. This is best explained by an example, using a recent post from this blog:</p><pre><code>curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G</code></pre><p>This command returns BibTeX metadata for this DOI:</p><pre><code>@misc{https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G,
  doi = {10.5438/0000-0C2G},
  url = {https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G},
  author = {Cruse, Patricia},
  publisher = {DataCite},
  title = {The OI Project gets underway planning an Open Organization Identifier Registry},
  year = {2017}
}</code></pre><p>Or maybe you want to go directly to the content, in this case the JATS XML for the blog post (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/content-negotiation-update/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-00cc">2017c</a>):</p><pre><code>curl -LH "Accept: application/xml" https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G</code></pre><p>Sometimes it is easier to use a normal link instead, e.g. in a web browser where sending HTTP headers is a bit involved.</p><pre><code>curl -L https://data.datacite.org/application/x-bibtex/10.5438/0000-0C2G</code></pre><p>For this to work you have to go directly to the DataCite content negotiation service at <strong><strong>data.datacite.org</strong></strong> instead of using the <strong><strong>doi.org</strong></strong> DOI proxy.</p><p>The most popular use of DOI content negotiation is citation formatting in any of the 1000s of citation styles provided by the Citation Style Language (<a href="http://citationstyles.org/">CSL</a>) project. For this we combine DOI content negotiation, which generates a JSON file from the metadata in a format that CSL understands (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/">Citeproc JSON</a>), with our <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/citation-formatting-service-upgrade/">DOI citation formatting service</a>, which generates the formatted citation:</p><pre><code>curl -LH "Accept: text/x-bibliography; style=apa" https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G</code></pre><p>This command returns a citation formatted in <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA style</a>:</p><pre><code>Cruse, P. (2017). The OI Project gets underway planning an Open Organization Identifier Registry. DataCite. https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G</code></pre><p>There is an easier way to get this information from DataCite if you don't feel comfortable using the command line. First find the DOI you want to cite in DataCite Search, e.g. <a href="https://search.datacite.org/works/10.5438/0000-0C2G">https://search.datacite.org/works/10.5438/0000-0C2G</a> in this case.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2017/04/search-result.png" class="kg-image" alt="Add to ORCID" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Add to ORCID</figcaption></figure><p>Then click on the <strong><strong>Cite</strong></strong> button and select on of several popular citation styles. We again pick the APA style:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2017/04/cite-apa.png" class="kg-image" alt="APA style" loading="lazy"><figcaption>APA style</figcaption></figure><p>This is the same formatted citation we saw earlier, as DataCite Search is using the content negotiation and citation formatting services in the background. These services have been around for several years, and we work together with other DOI registration agencies on this. The citation service in DataCite Search for example is based on Crossref <a href="https://github.com/crosscite/doi-metadata-search">open source code</a> originally written for <a href="https://search.crossref.org/">Crossref Metadata Search</a>.</p><h2 id="upcoming-changes">Upcoming Changes</h2><p>There is still room for improvement of the content negotiation service. As part of work in the EC-funded THOR project (Farquhar et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/content-negotiation-update/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/6423">2015</a>) we took a closer look at what you can and can't do with DOI content negotiation. We identified a number of gaps, and will address them by launching an updated content negotiation service in May.</p><h3 id="many-content-types-only-supported-with-required-metadata">Many content types only supported with required metadata</h3><p>The current DataCite content negotiation only supports the required metadata (identifier, creator, title, publisher, publicationYear, resourceTypeGeneral) for most content types. This means that even for something as straightforward as BibTeX DataCite is not converting the supported optional metadata such as <code>description</code>, <code>subject/keywords</code>, <code>version</code> or <code>license</code>. And for rich metadata such as RDF, a long list of properties is not converted.</p><h3 id="limited-person-name-parsing">Limited person name parsing</h3><p>Person names are very difficult to parse, in particular when not using the optional properties <code>givenName</code> and <code>familyName</code> introduced in DataCite Schema 4.0 last year (DataCite Metadata Working Group, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/content-negotiation-update/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0012">2016</a>). But proper parsing is important for citations, as different citation styles use different formatting rules for names. And BibTex expects a particular format that is hard to support without proper person name parsing.</p><h3 id="better-support-for-consistent-metadata-across-doi-registration-agencies">Better support for consistent metadata across DOI registration agencies</h3><p>Although content negotiation is supported by several DOI registration agencies, there is only limited support for common metadata beyond the basic citation metadata. This makes it harder than it should it to combine metadata records from different DOI registration agencies. The current RDF support is limited, and no DOI registration agency is offering content negotiation that converts metadata from another registration agency.</p><h3 id="support-for-additional-content-types">Support for additional content types</h3><p>The list of supported content types could be much longer, from emerging metadata standards such as <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> or <a href="http://www.scholix.org/">scholix</a> to community-specific standards such as <a href="https://www.ddialliance.org/">DDI</a> for social sciences, DATS for the life sciences (Sansone et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/content-negotiation-update/#ref-https://doi.org/10.1101/103143">2017</a>), or <a href="http://codemeta.github.io/">codemeta</a> for software.</p><h3 id="unrecognized-content-types-raise-an-error">Unrecognized content types raise an error</h3><p>When the DataCite DOI content negotiation encounters an unrecognized content type, it returns a <strong><strong>406 Not Acceptable</strong></strong> error. This means that it is impossible to implement content negotiation downstream at the data center, as all content negotiation requests will be redirected to DataCite. Data centers can register their custom content types in the DataCite MDS using the <code>media</code> API endpoint, but this feature is unfortunately not widely used.</p><p>DataCite has rewritten most of the code of the content negotiation service, and has extracted out the metadata conversion into a standalone library (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/content-negotiation-update/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/n138-z3mk">2017a</a>) that can also be used locally via the command line. The new service is currently in final testing at <a href="https://data.test.datacite.org/">https://data.test.datacite.org</a>, and we plan to launch this into production ion May 9th. We have worked on all the limitations listed above, and some of the highlights include:</p><ul><li>extensive support for schema.org/JSON-LD as a common metadata standard independent of a particular DOI registration agency</li><li>extensive RDF support as XML or Turtle via schema.org metadata</li><li>tested with DOIs from DataCite and Crossref, supports conversion of Crossref metadata to DataCite metadata</li><li>BibTeX and RIS files have proper file extension (.bib and .ris) for easier import into other applications.</li><li>new content type <code>codemeta</code>, other content types will be added in the coming months based on user feedback</li><li>available as open source software via Github (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/content-negotiation-update/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/t1jg-hvhn">2017b</a>) and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/crosscite/content-negotiation/">Docker Hub</a>.</li></ul><p>There is one breaking change that users should be aware of: the content type <code>text/html</code> will no longer be supported, as the DOI proxy always forwards requests with this content type to the URL registered in the handle system. Users who want to see a HTML representation of the DOI metadata should go to DataCite Search, i.e. <a href="https://search.datacite.org/works/10.5438/0000-0C2G">https://search.datacite.org/works/10.5438/0000-0C2G</a> instead of https://data.datacite.org/10.5438/0000-0C2G. We will be improving the information shown for a single DOI in DataCite Search in the coming months, and appreciate user feedback.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-01qj">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>DataCite Metadata Working Group.

        <updated>2017-01-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago we started assigning DOIs to every post on this blog (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/schema-org-register-dois/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/4K3M-NYVG">2016c</a>). The process we implemented uses a new <a href="https://github.com/datacite/cirneco">command line utility</a> and integrates well with our the publishing workflow, with (almost) no extra effort compared to how we published blog posts before.</p><p>Given that DataCite is a DOI registration agency, we obviously are careful about following best practices for assigning DOIs. DataCite focusses on DOIs for research data, but many of the general principles can also apply to blog posts. And we have learned a few things already.</p><h3 id="using-schemaorg-metadata-embedded-in-landing-pages">Using schema.org metadata embedded in landing pages</h3><p>Our initial implementation collected the metadata required for DOI registration in a way that is specific to a particular type of blogging software, so-called <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators">static site generators</a>. While popular, this leaves out a large number of blogs, for example every blog hosted by Wordpress, by far the most popular blogging platform. We have now relaunched our blog to collect metadata differently, generic enough to work for any blog, but also well aligned with best practices for DOIs.</p><p>Our practice is that every DOI should resolve to a landing page, and that landing page should provide both human- and machine-readable metadata. Machine-readable metadata can be embedded into web pages in a number of ways. Traditionally this was done using HTML meta tags, more recent approaches to embedding metadata in HTML include <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/microdata.html">microdata</a>, <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-rdfa-primer-20150317/">RDFa</a>. An alternative approach is to embed the metadata using JSON and a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. The latter approach is easier to implement, as all metadata are in a single place, and the JSON can be embedded dynamically via a script.</p><p>As for the vocabulary, the DataCite Metadata Schema has never been widely used for metadata embedded in web pages. Dublin Core Metadata (“Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1,” <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/schema-org-register-dois/#ref-http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dces">2012</a>) are often used for metadata in HTML <code>meta</code> tags. <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> is an initiative started in 2011 with many of the same goals as Dublin Core, namely to <em>create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet</em>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/12/schema-org.png" class="kg-image" alt="schema.org" loading="lazy"><figcaption>schema.org</figcaption></figure><p>Schema.org is widely adopted, not the least because the initiative was started by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex to help with indexing web pages for search. Schema.org metadata can be embedded using microdata, RDFa or JSON-LD.</p><p>DataCite has recently added support for schema.org in JSON-LD format to <a href="http://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html">DOI content negotiation</a>, for example <code>curl -LH "Accept: application/vnd.schemaorg.ld+json" https://doi.org/10.5438/4K3M-NYVG</code>. Schema.org in JSON-LD is also embedded in search results on <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite Search</a> using the tag <code>&lt;script type="application/vnd.schemaorg.ld+json"&gt;</code>.</p><p>The DataCite blog now uses schema.org in JSON-LD format to embed metadata in machine-readable format, for example for the blog post mentioned earlier:</p><pre><code>{

}</code></pre><p>If you are familiar with the DataCite Metadata Schema, it is easy to see how schema.org metadata can be converted into DataCite metadata and used with the DataCite Metadata Store, DataCite’s DOI registration and management service. The properties required by DataCite metadata (DOI, author, title, publisher, publicationYear, resourceTypeGeneral) are standard metadata for blog posts with the exception of the DOI. You can see that the JSON-LD <code>@id</code> is the DOI expressed as HTTPS URL (and that the <code>@id</code>for authors is their ORCID ID). And there are some naming differences e.g. <code>name</code> vs. <code>title</code>. The DataCite metadata corresponding to the above schema.org metadata look like this (and <a href="http://data.crosscite.org/application/vnd.datacite.datacite+xml/10.5438/4K3M-NYVG">can be downloaded</a> via DOI content negotiation):</p><pre><code>&lt;resource xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

&lt;/resource&gt;</code></pre><p>Schema.org metadata in JSON-LD format can be added to Wordpress blogs using a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-structuring-markup/">plugin</a>, and more generally can be added to any webpage using tools such as <a href="https://moz.com/blog/using-google-tag-manager-to-dynamically-generate-schema-org-json-ld-tags">Google Tag Manager</a>.</p><h3 id="doi-minting-workflow">DOI minting workflow</h3><p>Publishing a blog post with embedded schema.org metadata, which is then used to mint a DOI and register DOI metadata, changes the DOI minting workflow for this blog. Although the publication workflow of a blog is much simpler than for peer-reviewed content, there are still three distinct phases:</p><ul><li>post is drafted by author</li><li>post is shared for feedback with staff (and possibly others)</li><li>post is published</li></ul><p>A DOI for a DataCite blog post is minted in phase 2, i.e. as soon as it is clear that the post will be published. What we are not doing at this phase is making the metadata public – we set the <code>is_active</code> flag in the DataCite MDS to false. This prevents indexing in DataCite Search, and the post can only be found if you know the DOI. For sensitive content we could redirect the DOI to a generic landing page, but that would be overkill for the typical blog post. Once the post is published, we set the <code>is_active</code> flag to true, enabling indexing, and show the post on the DataCite blog homepage.</p><p>With this workflow we have the DOI before publication, which is helpful as a link to collect limited feedback, or for joint blog posts with other organizations, such as our organization identifier blog post in November (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/schema-org-register-dois/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/TNHX-54CG">2016a</a>).</p><p>On the other hand, we should not register the DOI too early, e.g. for draft posts that are never published. What we should also avoid is using something that looks like a DOI, but is not registered with the Handle system. Geoff Bilder has described the problems with such DOI-like strings as internal identifiers in a June 2016 <a href="http://blog.crossref.org/2016/06/doi-like-strings-and-fake-dois.html">post</a> on the Crossref blog.</p><p>The DataCite blog uses "cool" DOIs that are generated from random numbers using the base32 algorithm (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/schema-org-register-dois/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/55E5-T5C0">2016b</a>). We have modified this process a little bit: we create an internal identifier (we call them accession number) that contains a random number unique to the DataCite blog for every draft post – this post has accession number <code>MS-12</code>. When we mint the DOI this accession number - ignoring letters and hyphens - is turned into a DOI, and the DOI can be predicted because of the base32 algorithm. This workflow avoids using DOI-like strings as internal identifiers, and eliminates the small risk of using the same random number twice when minting a DOI.</p><h3 id="blog-posts-in-jats-xml">Blog posts in JATS XML</h3><p>Blog posts are web pages and the landing page for the DOI also contains the fulltext of the post. But there are good reasons to make a blog post also available in downloadable form, most importantly to facilitate reuse, and for archiving. Journal Article Tag Suite (<a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/">JATS</a>) is an XML standard for tagging journal articles, used by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> full-text archive of biomedical literature and by an increasing number of scholarly publishers.</p><p>JATS is an appropriate format for the blog posts of this blog, and starting this week all of our posts are also available in JATS XML format. You can see the download URL in the schema.org markup, we will add a more visible link to all posts once some minor tagging issues are resolved. We will also start registering the download URL with the DataCite MDS as <code>media</code>, making the JATS XML available to <a href="http://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html">DOI content negotiation</a>, and thus direct download. This should facilitate reuse by others, e.g. aggregation of content from multiple sources and display of content in different formats. This blog uses the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution</a> license, allowing the copying, redistribution and remixing of the material in any medium or format for any purpose.</p><h3 id="the-blog-as-container">The blog as container</h3><p>Also this week we assigned a DOI to the DataCite blog itself (Cruse, Rueda, Garza, &amp; Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/schema-org-register-dois/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-00SS">2015</a>). The blog is added as a <code>isPartOf</code> relation to the schema.org and DataCite metadata of each blog post. This should facilitate discovery of related content via metadata, and allows users to also refer to the blog itself instead of individual posts. The blog is registered as a <code>resourceTypeGeneral</code> of Collection.</p><p>The alternative would have been to describe the DataCite blog as the <code>publisher</code> of our blog posts. We are using <strong><strong>DataCite</strong></strong> as <code>publisher</code> instead, as we feel the publisher should be a person or organization.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/0000-00cc">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Cruse, P., Rueda, L., Garza, K., &amp; Fenner, M.

PLOS ONE (and PLOS) have changed scholarly publishing in many ways, from a DataCite perspective probably most importantly via the data policy <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2014/02/24/plos-new-data-policy-public-access-data-2/">updated in February 2014</a> that states that</p><blockquote>PLOS journals require authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception.</blockquote><p>PLOS ONE was not the first journal with a Joint Data Archiving Policy (Whitlock, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/mysteries-in-reference-lists/#ref-https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2010.11.006">2011</a>), but this policy update moved proper archiving in public repositories of data used in papers into the mainstream, given that PLOS ONE had become the largest journal in the world by number of papers published.</p><h2 id="volumes-issues-and-pages">Volumes, issues and pages</h2><p>Publishing so many papers, and doing this only in electronic form, means that PLOS ONE doesn't really have journal issues, and that papers are published daily as they become ready – a common pattern with online-only journals. This means that the traditional way of referencing a scholarly article via journal name, volume, issue and page numbers isn't really useful anymore, as a proxy PLOS ONE uses the publication year as volume, month as issue and an <a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.1/element/elocation-id.html">electronic location identifier</a> instead of page numbers, for example <em>PLOS ONE</em>, 9(8), e105948. But of course we don't use this information to uniquely identify and locate a PLOS ONE article, we use the DOI instead – <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105948">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105948</a> for this example.</p><p>This particular DOI is for an interesting article by Norris et al. (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/mysteries-in-reference-lists/#ref-https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105948">2014</a>) that describes how rocks in Death Valley slide with the help of thin layers of ice and wind, a phenomenon known since the 1940s, but in this paper for the first time systematically analyzed using GPS.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/12/journal.pone.0105948.g004.png" class="kg-image" alt="GPS-instrumented rock with its rock trail, Fig. 4 from Norris et al.

In other words, the references are formatted for a journal article that can be found as physical copy in a library, sorted and shelved by publication name, volume and issue. Only one in three references use a DOI and/or URL, even though that is the only way to fetch the online-only article.</p><p>Journal name, volume, issue and electronic location identifier also don't work too well in uniquely identifying the journal article, as this information is human-readable, but difficult for a machine to extract from the reference list. Many publishers of course link to referenced articles using the DOI behind the scenes even when not displaying the DOI, but that is a brittle implementation. Reference lists are for example also used by authors in manuscript submissions, and without DOIs displayed in the reference list it becomes much harder for the author to provide machine-readable information about the references used.</p><h2 id="citation-styles">Citation styles</h2><p>Reference lists remain one of the mysteries in scholarly publishing. Not only does this small example demonstrate that they still have not been fully adapted to how journal articles are published, read and cited in 2016, but you can also see that the examples use multiple citation styles. There are <a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles">thousands of them</a>, displaying the same information in so many different ways that generating and consuming references has become a business in itself. Another mystery is the limitation of the number of references in an online-only journal. While it makes sense to set some limit, these numbers sometimes seem arbitrarily low, coming from a time when every extra page printed was costly.</p><p>It seems unrealistic in the near future to ever agree on a common citation style. But what we can do is at least use a citation style that is widely used instead of reinventing one for every journal, and use a style that includes the DOI in the reference. PLOS switched from a PLOS-specific style to the Vancouver or NLM style (Patrias, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/mysteries-in-reference-lists/#ref-https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256">2015</a>) in 2015. This style is widely used by biomedical journals, and PLOS ONE articles now include DOIs in reference lists, as you can see for example in this 2015 PLOS ONE paper (Tenopir et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/mysteries-in-reference-lists/#ref-https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134826">2015</a>) – the sliding rocks paper was published in 2014.</p><p>Vancouver/NLM allows the inclusion of DOIs in references, but isn't really urging users to do so, and it still recommends a traditional style of referencing:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/12/ch1e1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The general format for a reference to a journal article, taken from (Patrias, 2015)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The general format for a reference to a journal article, taken from (Patrias, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/mysteries-in-reference-lists/#ref-https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256">2015</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>This blog uses the <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA style</a>, a style that is not only widely used and documented, but also includes DOIs in references (as you can see in the reference list of this blog post), and is one of the few citation styles with <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/12/how-to-cite-a-data-set-in-apa-style.html">specific support for data citations</a> (adding <em>[Data set]</em> after the title). And in contrast to the Vancouver style this style uses the <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Author-Date</a> format for in-text citations, providing more context to the reader of the article.</p><p>Using journal name, volume, issue and page numbers in a reference poses a particular challenge for DataCite, as the DataCite metadata schema doesn't support them. The main reason for this is DataCite's focus on providing metadata for datasets. Also, the DataCite metadata schema is based on <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-citation-guidelines/">Dublin Core</a>, which also doesn't have these properties (<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#bibliographicCitation">bibliographicCitation</a> can be used instead). More than 1.5 million text documents have been registered with a DataCite DOI, and many of them probably would have had journal name, volume, issue and pages information available. Should we add support for these properties to the DataCite metadata schema, or should we see these properties as no longer essential for citation information in a reference and leave them out of the metadata schema? I would argue that resources that have a digital object identifier don't require volume, issue and pages information to uniquely identify and/or locate the resource.</p><p>The other challenge for DataCite is that the current state of reference lists in journal articles makes it harder than needed to include data citations in them. When DOIs are not included in reference lists since the citation style doesn't want them displayed, then manuscripts with data citations submitted by authors need special treatment, which limits adoption because of the extra effort required. Publishers routinely rebuild reference lists from scratch by fetching the DOI and associated metadata based on the citation information provided, and these tools are built around citation metadata typically found in journal articles (including volume, issue and page information) and Crossref DOIs.</p><p>The conclusions from the above are simple:</p><blockquote>As a publisher, require a citation style that includes the DOI.</blockquote><h2 id="mystery-solved">Mystery solved?</h2><p>The X-Files is an American TV series about FBI special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who investigate unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. And in an episode aired in February 2016 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5240/68D6-DD1B-C9D5-AE84-9A9E-2">The X-Files: Mulder &amp; Scully Meet the Were-Monster</a>, via <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4549942/quotes">IMDB</a>), Fox Mulder refers to the PLOS ONE Sliding Rocks paper when he says:</p><blockquote>Scully, since we've been away, much of the "unexplained" has been explained. The "Death Valley Racetrack"? Turns out it was just ice formations, moving the rocks around as it melted. Yeah, ice.</blockquote><p>To refer to this episode you can again use <a href="https://doi.org/10.5240/68D6-DD1B-C9D5-AE84-9A9E-2">a DOI</a>, which in this case is not for scholarly content but is an <a href="http://eidr.org/">EIDR</a> – A universal unique identifier for movie and television assets.

For DataCite this means that we should use DOIs with appropriate metadata and strategies for long-term preservation for the scholarly outputs we produce. For the most part this is not research data, but rather technical documents such as the DataCite Schema and its documentation (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/eating-your-own-dog-food/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0012">2016</a>).</p><p>These outputs also include the posts on this blog, where we discuss topics relevant for the DataCite community, but also of broader interest to anyone who cares about research data, persistent identifiers, and scholarly infrastructure. And starting today all blog posts on this blog will have a DOI, metadata and use a persistent storage mechanism.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/12/230785.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Photo by Bill Emrich.

The command line utility is <a href="https://github.com/datacite/cirneco">Cirneco</a>, generating the metadata XML according to the DataCite Metadata Schema, and registering DOI and metadata with the DataCite MDS. Like all tools mentioned in this post Cirneco is open source software, please reach out to us if you are interested in implementing similar functionality for your blog.</p><h3 id="generating-dois">Generating DOIs</h3><p>The DOIs for this blog are generated automatically, using a modified base32 encoding algorithm that is provided by Cirneco, as discussed last week (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/eating-your-own-dog-food/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/55E5-T5C0">2016</a>). The DOI is generated and minted when a new post is pushed to <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/">https://blog.datacite.org</a>. This avoids two problems: a) DOI-like strings in the wild before publication and b) the randomly generated DOI exists already (we can simply generate a new one). All DOIs are short, without semantic infomation that might change over time, and with a checksum to minimize transcription errors, for example <strong><strong>https://doi.org/10.5438/XCBJ-G7ZY</strong></strong>. Going forward we encourage users to link to the DataCite Blog using the DOI, as these links will continue to work even if we ever move the blog to a different location.</p><h3 id="generating-metadata">Generating Metadata</h3><p>For the generation of metadata, we need to strike a balance between simple author provided metadata, but rich enough to aid discovery. We are doing this via three mechanisms:</p><ul><li>metadata provided by the author</li><li>default metadata for the blog</li><li>metadata automatically extracted from content</li></ul><p>The metadata provided by the author are the typical metadata for blog posts, provided via <a href="https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/">YAML front matter</a> at the beginning of each post:</p><pre><code>---
layout: post
title: Eating your own Dog Food
author: mfenner
date: 2016-12-19
tags:
- datacite
- doi
- metadata
---</code></pre><p>We can reuse all these metadata when generating DataCite metadata, using the tags as <code>subjects</code>.</p><p>The default metadata are metadata that always stay the same for the blog, such as <code>publisher</code>, <code>HostingInstitution</code> and <code>rights</code>. We can store them in a site-wide configuration file. We can also assume reasonable defaults that can be overridden in the YAML front matter, e.g. <code>resourceType</code> (we use <a href="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">BlogPosting</a> with <code>resourceTypeGeneral</code> Text) and <code>version</code>. We store more information about authors outside the blog post, including <code>givenName</code>, <code>familyName</code> and <code>nameIdentifier</code> (we now show the ORCID ID of every blog author at the bottom of the post).</p><p>Finally, there are metadata that we can automatically extract from the blog post, and we are currently doing this for the <code>description</code> and <code>relatedIdentifier</code>. This blog uses Pandoc and BibTex to generate the references section at the end, and we can fetch this information and convert it into the format needed for <code>relatedIdentifier</code>.</p><p>Taken together we can provide all metadata that are <em>required</em> or <em>recommended</em> in the Metadata Schema documentation (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/eating-your-own-dog-food/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0012">2016</a>), and we can do this without any extra effort for the author. The full XML is avalailable <a href="https://data.crosscite.org/application/vnd.datacite.datacite+xml/10.5438/4K3M-NYVG">here</a>.</p><p>Not all blog posts need to be cited formally with metadata in a <em>references</em> list formatted according to a specific citation style. But these metadata greatly help with discovery, a search in DataCite Search for <a href="http://search.datacite.org/works?query=eating+dog+food">eating dog food</a> will for example bring up this blog post as the first hit.</p><h3 id="persistent-storage">Persistent storage</h3><p>Using DOIs means that readers not only expect rich metadata that help with citation and discovery, but also that DataCite takes extra care to preserve the blog posts, thinking beyond the particular technical implementation or even the contiuing existence of this blog. This is an area where we do need to do more work, starting with a decision about the best archival format for a blog post (HTML, PDF, <a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/">JATS</a>?). For now blog posts are hosted in multiple Git repositories (<a href="https://github.com/datacite/blog">one of them on Github</a>), and in two independent Amazon S3 buckets that each use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html">versioning</a>. Multiple locations with versioning are a good start, but more work is clearly needed.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/4k3m-nyvg">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>DataCite Metadata Working Group.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gbilder">Geoff Bilder</a> from CrossRef likes to show the following slide at scholarly conferences, and then asks the audience what they see:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/article-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Paper 1" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Most of us probably immediately recognize this document as a scholarly article. This immediate recognition includes essential parts of an article such as the title - or the reference list:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/article2-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Paper 2" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Paper 2</figcaption></figure><p>This immediate recognition is a powerful concept, it makes it easy for the reader to navigate a scholarly document, e.g. to quickly jump to the abstract or references.</p><p>We don't have the same immediate recognition for datasets. Given that a large number of datasets in DataCite are in CSV (comma separated values) format, the closest we come to a immediately recognized document is probably the spreadsheet:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Spreadsheet_animation.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Container" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Container.<em>From: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spreadsheet_animation.gif">Wikimedia Commons</a>, licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</em></figcaption></figure><p>A canonical format for datasets goes beyond immediate recognition of the essential parts by the user, it would also greatly facilitate reuse of data. As <a href="https://twitter.com/nickstenning">Nick Stenning</a> from the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) pointed out at CSV.conf last year, the cost of shipping of goods is in large part determined by the cost of loading and unloading, and the container has dramatically changed that equation. He argued that common formats such as the OKFN <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/">data package</a> could do the same for data reuse.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/break-bulk-sacks.png" class="kg-image" alt="Bulk parcels" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Bulk parcels. <em>From: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hafenarbeiter_bei_der_Verladung_von_Sackgut_-_MS_Rothenstein_NDL,_Port_Sudan_1960.png">Wikimedia Commons</a>, licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately there are at least three problems with using spreadsheets as canonical format for datasets:</p><ul><li>not every dataset can be represented as a CSV file, there are many specialized formats (including of course Excel <code>.xlsx</code>)</li><li>we can't include descriptive metadata (not even authors or document title) in a CSV file</li><li>many datasets actually include a collecting of files: not only in CSV format, but also other data formats and support files such as a README.</li></ul><p>The approach taken by the OKFN data package format - and related formats such as the <a href="https://researchobject.github.io/specifications/bundle/">Research Object Bundle</a> - is to put all data files (in CSV or other formats) into a folder, together with a standardized machine-readable file that includes the metadata (e.g. title, authors, publication date and license). This folder can then compressed with <code>zip</code>, again yielding a single file (a very common approach used for example for <code>epub</code> and <code>docx</code>).</p><p>The concept described here (a collection of documents in a larger container, and a listing of all included documents) is of course at least as old as the scholarly article: the <strong><strong>book</strong></strong> as a canonical format for collections (of texts), and the <strong><strong>table of contents</strong></strong> to describe what is in the book.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Table_of_Contents_PANARCHIE_published_in_1860.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Table of contents" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Table of contents. <em>From: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Table_of_Contents_PANARCHIE_published_in_1860.JPG">Wikimedia Commons</a>, licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The approach described here would not only help package datasets into a more reusable standard format, but the scholarly article would also greatly benefit from migrating to a container format. We all know that the concept of the scholarly article described at the beginning of this posts is falling apart - an article is simply no longer a single text document. We have not only associated figures and tables, but also associated files that can't be easily included into the article PDF, in particular files that contain the data underlying the findings of the article, but also other supplementary information.</p><p>There are currently three common approaches referencing the underlying data in a scholarly article:</p><ul><li>inclusion in supporting information files without any specific linking</li><li>informal citation in the article text, most commonly in the materials and methods section</li><li>formal citation with inclusion in the reference list</li></ul><p>Until not too long ago I was a big proponent of including all data associated with an article in the reference list, mainly to make it easier to find the data. But the reference list isn't the appropriate place for something that is really part of the article - or as colleague <a href="http://bio.unc.edu/people/faculty/vision/">Todd Vision</a> puts it: the data generated for an article are another <strong><strong>output</strong></strong> rather than an <strong><strong>input</strong></strong>. Reference lists summarize all the inputs to an article, whereas outputs belong into a <strong><strong>table of contents</strong></strong>. A table of contents isn't a standard feature of scholarly articles yet, but to me is a logical next step for the journal article format, together with using the underlying concept of a container format described earlier in this post. Extracting references to datasets from a table of contents should be as easy as extracting them from a reference list, in particular if we make sure that this table of contents is openly available.</p><p>Journal Article Tag Suite (<a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/">JATS</a>) is the standard machine-readable format for journal articles in the life sciences (and increasingly other sciences). At <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/">JATS-CON</a> in April this year I proposed (starting at minute 210) to extend JATS by providing it also as a container format:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card kg-card-hascaption"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://videocast.nih.gov/embed.asp?live&#x3D;16116"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">NIH VideoCasting Event</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description"></div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://videocast.nih.gov/favicon.ico"></div></div></a><figcaption>JATS-CON 2015 Day 2</figcaption></figure><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/5aeg-weev">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <updated>2016-12-15T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 1998 Tim Berners-Lee coined the term cool URIs (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/cool-dois/#ref-https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">1998</a>), that is URIs that don’t change. We know that URLs referenced in the scholarly literature are often not cool, leading to link rot (Klein et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/cool-dois/#ref-https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115253">2014</a>) and making it hard or impossible to find the referenced resource.</p><p>Cool URIs are, of course, a fundamental principle behind DOIs, with the two important concepts <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html"><em>resolution</em></a> (it is very hard to maintain a URL directly pointing at a resource) and <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/6_Policies.html"><em>policies</em></a> (that all DOI registration agencies and organizations minting DOIs agree to maintain the redirection). The third essential element for DOIs, their <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/4_Data_Model.html"><em>data model</em></a>, is not directly about persistent linking, but about the discoverability of the linked resources via standard metadata in a central index.</p><p>All DOIs, expressed as HTTP URI, are therefore cool URIs. So what is a cool DOI? And, furthermore, how to create and use them? To understand what a cool DOI is, we have to explain the three parts that make up a DOI:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/12/doi-parts.png" class="kg-image" alt="The three parts that make up a DOI" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The three parts that make up a DOI</p><h3 id="proxy">Proxy</h3><p>The proxy is not part of the DOI specification, but almost all scholarly DOIs that users encounter today will be expressed as HTTP URLs. DataCite recommends that all DOIs are displayed as permanent URLs, consistent with the recommendations of other DOI registration agencies, e.g. the <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/doi_display_guidelines.html">Crossref DOI display guidelines</a>. When the DOI system was originally designed, it was thought that the DOI protocol would become widely used, but that clearly has not happened and displaying DOIs as <strong><strong>doi:10.5281/ZENODO.31780</strong></strong> is therefore not recommended.</p><p>The DOI proxy enables the functionality of expressing DOIs as HTTP URIs. Users should also be aware of two these two recommendations:</p><ul><li>Use <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_proxy/proxy_policies.html">doi.org</a> instead of dx.doi.org as DNS name</li><li>Use the HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP protocol</li></ul><p>Ed Pentz from Crossref makes the case for HTTPS in a <a href="http://blog.crossref.org/2016/09/new-crossref-doi-display-guidelines.html">September blog post</a>. The web, and therefore also the scholarly web, is moving to HTTPS as the default. It is important that the DOI proxy redirects to HTTPS URLs, and it will take some time until all DataCite data centers use HTTPS for the landing pages their DOIs redirects to.</p><p>What many users don’t know is that doi.org is not the only proxy server for DOIs. DOIs use the handle system and any handle server will resolve a DOI, just as doi.org will resolve any handle. This means that <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10.5281/ZENODO.31780">https://hdl.handle.net/10.5281/ZENODO.31780</a> will resolve to the landing page for that DOI and that https://doi.org/10273/BGRB5054RX05201 is a handle (for a <a href="http://www.igsn.org/">IGSN</a>) and not a DOI.</p><h3 id="prefix">Prefix</h3><p>The DOI prefix is used as a namespace so that DOIs are globally unique without requiring global coordination for every new identifier. Prefixes in the handle system and therefore for DOIs are numbers without any semantic meaning. One lesson learned with persistent identifiers is that adding meaning to the identifier (e.g. by using a prefix with the name of the data repository) is always dangerous, because – despite best intentions – all names can change over time.</p><p>Since the DOI prefix is a namespace to keep DOIs globally unique, there is usually no need for multiple prefixes for one organization managing DOI assignment. The tricky part is that these responsibilities can change, e.g. when an organization manages multiple repositories and one of them is migrated to another organization. It therefore makes sense to assign one prefix per list of resources that always stays together, e.g. one repository. It is possible that one prefix is managed by multiple organizations (as long as they use the same DOI registration agency), but that makes DOI management more complex.</p><h3 id="suffix">Suffix</h3><p>The suffix for a DOI can be (almost) any string. Which is both a feature and a curse. It is a feature because it gives maximal flexibility, for example when migrating existing identifiers to the DOI system. And it is a curse because it not always works well in the web context, as the list of characters allowed in a URL is limited. A good example of this are SICIs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier">Serial Item and Contribution Identifier</a>), they were defined in 1996 before the DOI system was implemented, and could then be migrated to DOIs. Unfortunately they can contain many characters that are problematic in a URL or make it difficult to validate the DOI, as in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1409(199908/10)3:6/7%3C672::aid-jpp192%3E3.0.co;2-8">https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1409(199908/10)3:6/7&lt;672::aid-jpp192&gt;3.0.co;2-8</a>. A Crossref <a href="http://blog.crossref.org/2015/08/doi-regular-expressions.html">blog post</a> by Andrew Gilmartin gives a good overview about the characters found in DOIs and suggests the following regular expression to check for valid DOIs:</p><pre><code>/^10.\d{4,9}/[-._;()/:A-Z0-9]+$/i</code></pre><p>SICIs demonstrate two other pitfalls:</p><ul><li>they contain semantic information (ISSN, volume, number, etc.) that may change over time, and</li><li>they are long, difficult to transcribe, with characters not allowed in URLs, and not very human-readable.</li></ul><p>Semantic information might also lead users to expect certain functionalities. A common pattern that we see at DataCite is to include information about the version or parent in the suffix, e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.3501629.V1">https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.3501629.V1</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.0SN63/7">https://doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.0SN63/7</a>. While the decision on what to put into the suffix is up to each data center, we should make sure users don't think that these are functionalities of the DOI system (e.g. that adding <strong><strong>.V2</strong></strong> to any DOI name will resolve to version 2 of that resource).</p><p>Another issue to keep in mind when assigning suffixes is that DOIs – in contrast to HTTP URIs – are case-insensitive, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.31780">https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.31780</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.31780">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.31780</a> are the same DOI. All DOIs are <a href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html#2.4">converted to upper case</a> upon registration and DOI resolution, but DOIs are not consistently displayed in such a way.</p><h3 id="generating-cool-dois">Generating cool DOIs</h3><p>With all that, what should the ideal DOI look like? Its suffix should be:</p><ul><li>opaque without semantic information</li><li>work well in a web environment, avoiding characters problematic in URLs</li><li>short and human-readable</li><li>Resistant to transcription errors</li><li>easy to generate</li></ul><p>On Tuesday DataCite released a tool that helps generating such a suffix, an open source command line tool called <a href="https://github.com/datacite/cirneco">cirneco</a> (a lot of our open source software uses Italian dog breed names). Cirneco is a Ruby gem that can be installed via</p><pre><code>gem install cirneco</code></pre><p>Cirneco uses base32 encoding, as <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html">described</a> by Douglas Crockford. The encoding starts with a randomly generated number to guarantee uniqueness of the identifier, and then encodes the number into a string that uses all numbers and uppercase letters. It avoids the letters I, O and L as they can be confused with the letter 1 and 0, using 32 characters (and 5 checksum characters) in total. The last character is a checksum. The resulting string from cirneco always has a length of 8 characters, in groups of 4 separated by a hyphen to help with readability. The advantage of base32 encoding over using only numbers (as for example ORCID is doing) is that the resulting string becomes much more compact, the available 7 characters (plus one for the checksum) can encode 34,359,738,367 strings, compared to 10 million when only using numbers. This number is large enough that the resulting suffix will not only be unique for a given prefix, but also unique for all DOIs (there is a very small chance to get the same random number twice, but this will be rejected when trying to register the DOI).</p><p>Another common way to generate random strings would have been universally unique identifiers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a>), but they are long and not very human-readable, e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.4233/UUID:6D192FE2-DE18-4556-873A-D3CD56AB96A6">https://doi.org/10.4233/UUID:6D192FE2-DE18-4556-873A-D3CD56AB96A6</a>.</p><p>An example DOI generated by cirneco would be</p><pre><code>cirneco doi generate --prefix 10.5555
10.5555/KVTD-VPWM</code></pre><p>The generated DOI is short enough that it should work well in places where space is limited, providing an alternative to the <a href="http://shortdoi.org/">ShortDOI</a> service which shortens existing DOIs, but does this by adding another layer on top of the DOI proxy.</p><p>Another cirneco command checks that this is a valid bas32 string using the checksum</p><pre><code>cirneco doi check 10.5555/KVTD-VPWM
Checksum for 10.5555/KVTD-VPWM is valid</code></pre><p>This can be used to quickly verify a DOI, e.g. in a web form or API. The Ruby base32 encoding library used by cirneco is open source (<a href="https://github.com/datacite/base32">https://github.com/datacite/base32</a>. I added the checksum to the existing library), and implementations of the Crockford base32 encoding pattern are available in many other languages, including <a href="https://github.com/jbittel/base32-crockford">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dflydev/dflydev-base32-crockford">PHP</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/base32-crockford">Javascript</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22385467/crockford-base32-encoding-for-large-number-java-implementation">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/richardlehane/crock32">Go</a> and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/crockford-base32">.NET</a>.</p><p>To answer the question raised at the beginning: a cool DOI is a DOI expressed as HTTPS URI using the doi.org proxy and using a base32-encoded suffix, for example <strong><strong>https://doi.org/10.5555/KVTD-VPWM</strong></strong>. This DOI works well in a web environment, is human readable, easy to parse and detect (e.g. in text mining), and can be generated using an algorithm that is well understood and supported.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/12/cool-dois.svg" class="kg-image" alt="Cool DOIs" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Cool DOIs</figcaption></figure><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/55e5-t5c0">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Berners-Lee, T.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we are launching a new version of the DataCite API at <a href="http://api.datacite.org/">http://api.datacite.org</a>. This new version includes numerous bug fixes and now includes related resources (e.g. data centers, members or contributors) according to the <a href="http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes">JSONAPI spec</a>. The changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/datacite/spinone/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>. Current users of the API should watch out for breaking changes in the <code>meta</code> object used for faceting.</p><p>We first launched the DataCite API in June as what we hope will become the new standard way to retrieve metadata from DataCite. Most of the content in the API comes from our search index of the MDS and is about DOI metadata, but we are also including information from other services, e.g. our member database and the <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/its-all-about-relations/">Event Data</a> service. We ourselves use the API to power the web frontend for search, to <a href="https://www.datacite.org/members.html">display member information</a> on our homepage, and to provide a search for our <a href="http://blog.datacite.org/">blog</a>.</p><p>Other ways to obtain DataCite metadata include <a href="http://oai.datacite.org/">OAI-PMH</a> for harvesting large volumes of metadata, and direct access to the Solr search index. This direct public access to the Solr search index will be discontinued in 2017 for performance and security reasons, so we encourage all users to migrate to the DataCite API as soon as possible. We will be adding missing API functionality in the coming months, most importantly provide all available DOI metadata in the API and thus search web frontend. Please <a href="mailto:tech@datacite.org">contact us</a> if you have suggestions or bug reports regarding the DataCite API.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/6wcf-efw5">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The scholarly research community has come to depend on a series of open identifier and metadata infrastructure systems to great success. Content identifiers (through DataCite and Crossref) and contributor identifiers (through ORCID) have become foundational infrastructure for the community. But there is one piece of the infrastructure that is missing -- there currently is no open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for organization identifiers and associated metadata.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/11/london_institute.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The London Institution.

Source: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:London_Institution_at_the_Finsbury_Circus.jpg">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>In early 2016, DataCite began a collaboration with ORCID and Crossref to explore the organization identifiers landscape and on how our organizations could work with the community to solve the organization identifier problem (Demeranville et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-organization-identifier-project/#ref-https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.3479141">2016</a>). Out of those conversations emerged a way forward as expressed in the following documents:</p><ol><li>Organization Identifier Project: A Way Forward (Cruse, Haak, &amp; Pentz, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-organization-identifier-project/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/2906">2016</a>)</li><li>Organization Identifier Provider Landscape (Bilder, Brown, &amp; Demeranville, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-organization-identifier-project/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/4716">2016</a>)</li><li>Technical Considerations for an Organization Identifier Registry (Fenner, Paglione, Demeranville, &amp; Bilder, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-organization-identifier-project/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/7885">2016</a>)</li></ol><p>We invite the community to comment on these papers online via email (<a href="mailto:oi-project@orcid.org">oi-project@orcid.org</a>) or comments in the corresponding Google Docs (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpWRBnlrU_X6TwYzQlB89w4FNXMLqieJv-RW0irNTsg/edit?usp=sharing">1</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcKXWm9PxDvVWBxdlH7BVU7w8esnW0F_dppNiCJ9BW8/edit#">2</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj5sRRdnjKLjY81AbaeUdal3n6VuQgi1H66vRMaayiA/edit?usp=sharing">3</a>), or in person at <a href="https://crossreflive16.sched.org/">Crossref LIVE16</a> on November 1st and 2nd or at <a href="http://pidapalooza.org/">PIDapalooza</a> on November 9th and 10th. To move The OI Project forward, we will be forming a Community Working Group with the goal of holding an initial meeting before the end of 2016. The Working Group’s main charge is to develop a plan to launch and sustain an open, independent, non-profit organization identifier registry to facilitate the disambiguation of researcher affiliations</p><h2 id="datacite%E2%80%99s-focus">DataCite’s Focus</h2><p>An important focus of DataCite’s work is to connect resources , which have a DataCite DOI, to other resources - for example <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/dynamic-data-citation-webinar/">new versions of the same dataset</a>, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/to-better-understand-research-communication-we-need-a-groid-group-object-identifier/">collections of related datasets</a>, or <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/location-of-the-citation/">articles citing the dataset</a>. Equally important is the support for linking these resources to the people and organizations who have contributed to their generation. We are working closely with ORCID to enable <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-datacite-profiles-service/">linking between DataCite DOIs and ORCID IDs</a>. In July we <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/relaunching-datacite-search/">relaunched our search</a> to better show these relations between DataCite DOIs and other resources. And in September we launched an updated DataCite Metadata Schema (DataCite Metadata Working Group, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-organization-identifier-project/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0012">2016</a>) with better support for linking to funding information. Enabling all these relations are persistent identifiers and metadata describing these relations.</p><p>DataCite also supports the linking of resources to academic institutions in one of two ways: Using the <strong><strong>HostingInstitution</strong></strong> contributor role, or via the <strong><strong>affiliation</strong></strong> attribute for creators and contributors. One gap we identified when analyzing linking to organizations (Fenner et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-organization-identifier-project/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.30799">2015</a>) last September is the lack of adoption of organizational identifiers. Without broad adoption of identifiers for organizations similar to how DataCite DOIs, Crossref DOIs and ORCID IDs are widely used in the scholarly community, it becomes very difficult to track these relations to institutions in a way similar to how we can track relations to people.</p><p>Again, we look forward to the community’s feedback either via email or in person at the <a href="http://pidapalooza.org/">PIDapalooza</a> conference next week.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/tnhx-54cg">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On July 12, 2016, DataCite invited <a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~andi/">Andreas Rauber</a> to present the recommendations for dynamic data citation of the <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/groups/data-citation-wg.html">RDA Data Citation Working Group</a> in a webinar.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/07/dynamic-data.png" class="kg-image" alt="Dynamic data" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Dynamic data</figcaption></figure><p>Andreas is one of the co-chairs of the RDA working group, and he gave a throughout overview of the recommendations, and the thinking that went into them. The <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/system/files/documents/RDA-DC-Recommendations_151020.pdf">final recommendations</a> are available since last fall, and the current focus of the working group is to help with implementations.</p><p>The recommendations have to be implemented in the data center, but DataCite is happy to help coordinate the work, and to provide feedback to Andreas and the rest of the working group where needed. Of particular importance from a DataCite perspective is <strong><strong>recommendation 8</strong></strong>:</p><blockquote>Query PID: Assign a new PID to the query if either the query is new or if the result set returned from an earlier identical query is different due to changes in the data. Otherwise, return the existing PID.</blockquote><p>Assigning a persistent identifier (not only) when a dataset is originally generated, but also when a dataset is about to be cited, is central not only to the working group recommendations for dynamic data citation, but also crucial for other data citation use cases. Data exist at different levels, from raw data possibly generated by a machine, to highly processed data used in a publication. The figure below – presented by Robin Dasler from CERN at the <a href="https://project-thor.eu/2016/06/21/july-7-2016-thor-workshop-identifiers-infrastructure-impact-and-innovation/">THOR Workshop</a> on July 7 in Amsterdam - demostrates this for high-energy physics (HEP):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/07/hep.png" class="kg-image" alt="HEP" loading="lazy"><figcaption>HEP</figcaption></figure><p>DataCite DOIs are intended as citation identifiers. They are persistent identifiers and provide standardized metadata, including links to associated publications, contributors and funders. They thus focus on the data in the top section of the pyramid. While we can also use DataCite DOIs for the other levels of the pyramid, sometimes other identifiers are more appropriate for raw, non-persistent data generated my machines. Dynamic data citation can be seen as a variant of the process that this pyramid describes.</p><p>If you could not attend last week or you want to review the session, the recording of the webinar is available:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/174795589" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(102, 97, 91); font-family: Raleway, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"></iframe></figure><p>The <a href="https://project-thor.eu/">THOR project</a> will work with interested data centers on dynamic data citation in the coming 12 months, hopefully leading to important feedback and a few more implementations of the RDA working group recommendations.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CSV in many ways is for data what Markdown is for text documents: a very simple format that is both human- and machine-readable, and that – despite a number of shortcomings - is widely used. Given the popularity of Markdown for writing blog posts, using CSV to publish blog posts with tabular data should be an obvious thing to do, and we have just published our first blog post using CSV data. The blog post shows Table 3 from the DataCite Metadata Schema (DataCite Metadata Working Group, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/publishing-tabular-data-as-blog-post/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0010">2014</a>), describing the mandatory properties.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/05/periodic_table.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Periodic table of elements. From: Wikipedia" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Periodic table of elements. From: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>The DataCite blog uses the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site generator, and all blog posts are written in Markdown format. All posts have their metadata in YAML format at the beginning of the file (separated by <code>---</code> from the main text).</p><pre><code>---
layout: post
title: Publishing tabular data as blog post
author: mfenner
tags:
 - csv
 - metadata
 - blog
---</code></pre><p>Markdown is a nice format for writing texts, but doesn't work so well for tabular data, as the current Markdown table implementations are difficult to edit and read for humans for all but the simplest tables. CSV is a much better fit for tabular data, and can be written both with a general text editor, or with a spreadsheet program or other specialized tool.</p><p>To add the metadata required for every Jekyll blog post we are again adding a YAML header, the resulting file format is <a href="http://csvy.org/">CSVY</a>, about which we have talked before (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/publishing-tabular-data-as-blog-post/#ref-https://blog.datacite.org/thinking-about-csv">2016b</a>). Jekyll can be extended to understand many file formats beyond Markdown. As a <code>CSVY</code> converter doesn't exist yet, we have written this converter and released <strong><strong>jekyll-csvy</strong></strong> as Ruby gem (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/publishing-tabular-data-as-blog-post/#ref-https://github.com/datacite/jekyll-csvy">2016a</a>), so that <code>CSVY</code> support can be easily added to every Jekyll-powered blog.</p><p>In HTML tabular data are typically displayed as HTML tables, and this is what we are doing with the <code>CSVY</code> converter. This works well for tables that are not too wide, and the converter supports inline Markdown formatting (bold, italic, links, etc.) in table cells. Block formatting (e.g. lists) is on our list of future improvements, and we will polish the converter based on user feedback. We are of course also interested in embedding CSV tables within Markdown documents, as this is a common use case.</p><p>One important feature of using CSVY for blog posts is that the CSV remains available, and can be ingested and processed by tools that can read CSVY, e.g. using the R rio (Becker et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/publishing-tabular-data-as-blog-post/#ref-https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/index.html">2016</a>) package.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/5aeg-weev">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Becker, J., Chan, C.-h., Chan, G.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Data citation is core to DataCite's mission and DataCite is involved in several projects that try to facilitate data citation, including <a href="https://project-thor.eu/">THOR</a>, <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/dcip">Data Citation Implementation Pilot (DCIP)</a>, <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/">Research Data Alliance (RDA)</a>, and <a href="http://www.copdess.org/">COPDESS</a>. The biggest roadblock for wider data citation adoption might be insufficient incentives for individual researchers, but another major challenge is that implementing data citation is still too complicated.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/05/Citation_needed_stickers.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Citation needed.

By User:Tfinc (Own work) <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure><p>When we talk about data citation, we typically mean two related, but different scenarios:</p><ol><li>an article or other scholarly work cites an already published dataset.</li><li>all data and related metadata underlying the findings reported in a submitted manuscript should be deposited in an appropriate public repository (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">PLOS data availability statement</a>)</li></ol><p>The first scenario is not conceptually different from an article citing another article, where the common practice is to put everything that is cited into the reference list.</p><p>The second scenario is probably not only more common, but also requires more complex workflows, e.g. coordination of issuing persistent identifiers for article and data and linking them together via metadata. And we as a community are still working on common practices for doing this. Assuming again that incentives are the biggest driver of change, I would argue that researchers, publishers, and funders are all interested in making this work, but that data repositories have the strongest motivation to improve the current situation. If this is true then we should give data repositories a bigger role in the publication of data associated with an article.</p><p>While many publishers host supplementary information for articles, they leave the hosting of more complex research data to external data repositories specialized in this task. Properly referencing all associated data in the article is currently the job of the publisher, and I propose that we give more of this responsibility to the data repository. The data repository can create a data catalog card (with associated persistent identifier and metadata) that describes all data associated with an article. The data catalog card is a collection of metadata, and different from a data paper. The data described in the catalog card can be hosted in that repository or elsewhere.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/05/medium_message.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The medium is the message.

The publisher could (and should) still link to individual data where appropriate, but the proposed solution helps solve several important issues:</p><ul><li>the data catalog card simplifies manuscript submission for publishers</li><li>the data record provides a machine-readable representation of the data availability statement that publishers are increasingly requiring</li><li>the publisher doesn't need to provide machine-readable metadata for all data used in an article, but can reference the data catalog card. Accession numbers that are not globally unique can be used in the article if they are properly referenced in the data catalog card. This facilitates the transition from current practices</li><li>some articles refer to thousands of datasets (e.g. genomics papers), and this number of links is difficult to describe in the traditional article format (e.g. <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/">JATS</a>)</li></ul><p>Several general purpose data repositories already provide most or all of this functionality, I am most familiar with <a href="https://www.datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>, BioStudies (McEntyre, Sarkans, &amp; Brazma, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-catalog-cards-simplifying-article-data-linking/#ref-https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20156658">2015</a>) and Figshare (Hyndman, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-catalog-cards-simplifying-article-data-linking/#ref-https://figshare.com/blog/Unveiling_figshare_Collections_a_new_way_to_group_content/202">2016</a>). Data catalog cards probably work best for repositories that a flexible in the kinds of data they take, and repositories that already have integrations with publishers. Not every data repository needs to support this functionality. Data catalog cards are also an opportunity for differentiation, e.g. by providing data curation, help with data review, etc.</p><p>My thinking about this topic was triggered by a conversation with <a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile?profile_id=1667831">Tim Clark</a> in the context of the DCIP project. The guest post by Dan S. Katz (Katz, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-catalog-cards-simplifying-article-data-linking/#ref-https://blog.datacite.org/to-better-understand-research-communication-we-need-a-groid-group-object-identifier">2016</a>) and the discussion around it was another important motivation, and a DataCite blog post from last August (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-catalog-cards-simplifying-article-data-linking/#ref-https://blog.datacite.org/reference-lists-and-tables-of-content">2015</a>) contains some of the ideas expressed here. Obviously this topic is of great interest to DataCite, as we hope that data catalog cards use DataCite DOIs, and that we can help both with making article/data publishing workflows easier, and with discovering data associated with an article.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/cab5-teg0">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Fenner, M.

        <updated>2016-05-04T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week some of us from DataCite are attending <a href="http://csvconf.com/">CSVconf</a> in Berlin, and we are a conference sponsor and co-organizer.</p><blockquote>csv,conf is a non-profit community conference run by some folks who really love data and sharing knowledge. If you are as passionate about data and the application it has to society as us then you should join us in Berlin!</blockquote><p>One important reason we are at CSVconf is that providing persistent identifiers and starndard metadata for research data, which in most cases are stored in tabular data formats such as CSV, is central to what DataCite is doing. And while DataCite provides a searchable index of metadata for these datasets, getting the metadata into the index is not as frictionless as one would hope.</p><p>The presentations and informal discussions at the conference have been very valuable and entertaining so far, and we still have most of the second day ahead. My personal highlight from the first day: <a href="https://twitter.com/blahah404">Richard Smith-Unna</a> talking about <strong><strong>Easy, massive-scale reuse of scientific outputs</strong></strong>.</p><p>One topic that I have been thinking about the past two days is how to add metadata to CSV files while keeping the simplicity of the format. This is important for DataCite, as we want to make the process of registering datasets with metadata painless, and for individual researchers and small research groups the process should be as simple as possible. Two groups have done great work in this area and Jeni Tennison and Dan Fowler gave presentations about their work at CSVconf:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Jeni Tennison</strong></strong>: Making CSV part of the web, describing the work of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page">CSV on the Web</a> W3C working group</li><li><strong><strong>Dan Fowler</strong></strong>: Data Packages and Frictionless Data for Research, talking about the work Open Knowledge has done on defining <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/">data packages</a></li></ul><p>Both groups use a JSON file to describe the metadata of an associated CSV file. While it is a straightforward process, it still feels as if we are leaving the simplicity of the CSV format. And when we generate a JSON file to describe the metadata, we might as well convert the CSV into JSON and put the metadata into the same file.</p><p><a href="https://blog.datacite.org/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/">Back in September</a> I wrote about a different approach: adding the metadata directly to the CSV file. The following slides summarize this work:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe class="speakerdeck-iframe" frameborder="0" src="https://speakerdeck.com/player/0485d6ed325144bcb155f771e6bfd842?" title="null" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; background: padding-box rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 5px 40px; width: 893px; height: 670px;"></iframe></figure><p>CSVY uses a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">YAML header</a> for the metadata. This keeps the CSV file human readable, and is extensible to add even complex metadata. The downside is of course that it breaks the CSV format, but many CSV parsers support comments and can skip lines at the beginning of a file. Implementing CSVY support would thus only be a small step, and should be backwards compatible in many cases. You can for example use Excel to open these files, of course not parsing the metadata in the YAML header.</p><p>The beauty of this approach from a DataCite perspective is that we can now build a workflow where sending a single CSVY file to an appropriate API is all that is needed to deposit a CSV file into a data repository, and register a DOI with metadata for it.</p><p>There are obviously synergies with <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, <em>a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown</em>. Markdown is a lightweight markup format for text documents, similar to CSV being a lightweight format for data. Tables is one of the things in markdown that are not really lightweight, and CommonMark doesn't (yet) include a syntax for table formatting. We could use CSVY to make tables really simple in markdown. The metadata for the table can be added to the YAML header (something that is commonly used for markdown documents), and the CSV can be added directly to the markdown file. I use <code>,,,</code> to indicate that this is a table.</p><pre><code>,,,CSVconf Speakers

,,,</code></pre><p>Alternatively we might want to read in the CSV from an external file, using a tag that could look like this:</p><pre><code>,[CSVconf Speakers](/_data/speakers.csvy)</code></pre><p>CSVY is compatible with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page">CSV on the Web</a> and <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/">data packages</a> described above as it should be easy to convert the CSVY file with YAML header into a CSV file and JSON file with the metadata, and then host the two files on the web using the CSV on the Web recommendations.</p><p>CSVY is not meant to cover all use cases for CSV files, but should be useful to many people working with CSV. The critical factor is of course tool support in languages that commonly are used to work with CSV files, e.g. Python, R, and Javascript. I learned today that the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/index.html">rio package for R</a> is supporting CSVY, so that is a great start.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week most of the DataCite staff is attending the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2016">Force16</a> conference in Portland, Oregon. Force16 brings together a large group of people who either already work with DataCite in one way or another, or are doing interesting projects of relevance to DataCite.</p><p><a href="https://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> is a non-profit that helps scientists learn where their research is being cited, shared, saved and more. Ten days ago ImpactStory <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/new-better-freer/">launched a new version</a> that is built all around ORCID IDs and DOIs. Both the data and the software running the service are open, and the new version integrates naturally with the ORCID/DOI integrations that DataCite is working on as part of the <a href="https://project-thor.eu/">THOR project</a>. The ImpactStory co-founders Jason Priem and Heather Piwowar are both attending Force16 and we had a great conversation on how the new ImpactStory could be integrated with what DataCite is doing.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a popular repository for software source code, and GitHub staff member <a href="https://github.com/arfon">Arfon Smith</a> is at Force16 as co-chair of the Force11 <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group">Software Citation Working Group</a>. In the past two years we have seen an increasing number of DOIs (currently about 7,200) <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">minted for archived versions of GitHub software releases</a>, deposited mainly in the <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> repository. Just as we want to use DOIs to make it easier for software to become part of the scholarly record, we want to link GitHub and ORCID accounts to facilitate the recognition of scientific software engineers in the current scholarly ecosystem.</p><p>The latest version of the <a href="https://profiles.datacite.org/">DataCite Profiles</a> service released today has added support for ImpactStory and GitHub. If you have an orcid with publications in it you can see a summary from ImpactStory in DataCite Profiles, and a direct link will send you to your ImpactStory profile page. You can now link your GitHub account via OAuth authentication, linking the ORCID identifier used by DataCite Profiles with the GitHub username.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/04/impactstory.png" class="kg-image" alt="Example of DataCite Profiles Settings Page" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Example of DataCite Profiles Settings Page</figcaption></figure><p>To try out this new functionality, go to the <a href="https://profiles.datacite.org/">DataCite Profiles</a> service, and then after login to your <a href="https://profiles.datacite.org/settings/me">Settings</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/location-of-the-citation/">guest post</a> two weeks ago Elizabeth Hull explained that only 6% of Dryad datasets associated with a journal article are found in the reference list of that article, data she also presented at the IDCC conference in February (Mayo, Hull, &amp; Vision, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/its-all-about-relations/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.32412">2015</a>). This number has increased from 4% to 8% between 2011-2014, but is still low. One important reason is missing incentives: we don't yet have the same automated citation linking between articles and data that exists between articles thanks to <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a>.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if a data publisher such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is automatically informed about journal articles citing one of their datasets (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>)?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/04/oak_ridge.png" class="kg-image" alt="Global, Regional, and National Fossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Global, Regional, and National Fossil-Fuel CO2 Emissions.</figcaption></figure><p>The challenge: both DataCite and Crossref collect metadata as part of the respective DOI registration services they provide. These metadata describe the information required for a citation (title, authors, publication date, etc.) (DataCite Metadata Working Group, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/its-all-about-relations/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/0010">2014</a>). And the metadata can contain references to related resources. But what is missing is an automated exchange of the information collected by Crossref and DataCite.</p><p>We can't simply store information coming from Crossref in the DataCite Metadata Store (<a href="https://mds.datacite.org/">MDS</a>) for two reasons:</p><ol><li>Only the organization publishing the DOI can update the metadata, and it is important to keep it this way to to have a single authoritative source.</li><li>The DataCite MDS stores information about DataCite DOIs, but can't store metadata (again title, authors, publication date, etc.) for other resources such as Crossref DOIs.</li></ol><p>DataCite thus needs a service to enhance its DataCite Metadata Store (MDS). Data citations are the most important use case, but his service should be flexible enough to also handle information coming from other providers besides Crossref, for example claims of DataCite DOIs in the ORCID registry or links of DataCite DOIs to code repositories such as Github.</p><p>The new service is called <a href="https://eventdata.test.datacite.org/">DataCite Event Data</a>, and the screenshot above shows six data citations coming from Crossref. The software powering the service is called <a href="http://www.lagotto.io/">Lagotto</a>, open source software originally developed in 2009 by the Open Access publisher <a href="http://www.plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a>. While Lagotto provides the basic functionality needed for the Event Data service, significant development effort was required to enable the full functionality described above. This work was done, and will continue, in close collaboration with Crossref, as Crossref wants to address similar use cases. Although the core Crossref infrastructure is built around citation linking of publications, Crossref is working on <a href="http://blog.crossref.org/2016/02/event-data-open-for-your-interpretation.html">registering other online events associated with Crossref DOIs</a>, e.g. a Wikipedia page referencing one or more journal articles.</p><p>This Tuesday we released version 5 of the Lagotto software (Fenner et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/its-all-about-relations/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.49516">2016</a>) with support for what we need for the Event Data service. The release would not have been possible without developer <a href="https://github.com/afandian">Joe Wass</a> from Crossref. The list of changes is long and can be read about in detail in the <a href="https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/releases/tag/v.5.0.1">release notes</a>. The highlights include:</p><ol><li>A <strong><strong>deposits</strong></strong> API allowing anyone with a valid API key to push events into the system using a JSON object which can be (almost) as simple as</li></ol><pre><code>{ "subj_id": "https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.2857",
  "obj_id": "https://doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.7BQ5T",
  "relation_type_id": "cites",
  "sourceid": "europepmc_fulltext" }</code></pre><ol><li>A <strong><strong>contributor</strong></strong> model to aggregate resources by contributor, using the ORCID ID as persistent identifier.</li><li>Support for <strong><strong>Github</strong></strong>, describing the relations between software release, code repository, and repository owner, for the by now more than 7,000 DataCite DOIs for software linked to a Github release.</li></ol><p>In the coming months DataCite and Crossref will continue developing the platform to build out their Event Data services, so stay tuned for updates. And if you don’t mind minor bugs and incomplete data (currently about 1.2 million events for about 400,000 DataCite DOIs), take a look at <a href="https://eventdata.test.datacite.org/">DataCite Event Data</a> and send us your feedback.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/04/lagotto.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A real life lagotto.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a provider of crucial scholarly infrastructure, it is critical that DataCite not only provides a reliable service, but also <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/problems-with-dx.doi.org-on-january-20th-2015-what-we-know./">properly communicates problems</a>. The best way to do this is via a central status page, a best practice used by many organizations from <a href="https://status.github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://status.disqus.com/">Diqus</a> to <a href="https://status.slack.com/">Slack</a>. Because you don't want to run the status page with the rest of your infrastructure (as the page may go down if there is a problem), many organizations use a third-party service.</p><p>Today DataCite is launching a status page for all its services at <a href="http://status.datacite.org/">http://status.datacite.org</a>. You can also reach the status page via the navigation menu  in the upper right corner of recently launched DataCite services. Below is more information about the main features of the service.</p><h2 id="services-status">Services status</h2><p>At the top of the status page we provide an overview of the status of all our services.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2016/01/services-overview.png" class="kg-image" alt="Services Overview" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Services Overview</figcaption></figure><p>We will update the status manually when there is an issue, possible values are</p><ul><li>Operational</li><li>Degraded Performance</li><li>Partial Outage</li><li>Major Outage</li></ul><p>The overall status at the top of the page reflects these changes.</p><h2 id="live-system-metrics">Live system metrics</h2><p>The DataCite status page shows the aggregated uptime for all DataCite services.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The DataCite blog has migrated to a new platform, from a hosted version at <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> to a self-hosted version using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The main reason for this change is that it gives us more control over the formatting of blog posts. The migration was easy as both Ghost and Jekyll use <a href="http://support.ghost.org/markdown-guide/">markdown</a> to format blog posts, and the blog post URLs haven't changed.</p><p>Other than some layout changes that make the blog look and feel more consistent with other DataCite sites, the other main difference that users will see is that the blog now uses formal citations and reference lists for scholarly content. A September blog post (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-blog-relaunch/#ref-https://blog.datacite.org/adding-references-to-the-datacite-blog">2015</a>) described the background for this, and a good example where you can see the change is the post summarizing the September persistent identifier workshop in Paris (Cruse, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-blog-relaunch/#ref-https://blog.datacite.org/recap">2015</a>).</p><p>Below are some tips if you also want to add formal references to your blog:</p><ol><li>Use markdown format and Jekyll with <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to convert markdown to html. You can add Pandoc support to Jekyll by adding <code>gem 'jekyll-pandoc'</code> to the Jekyll Gemfile and the following into <code>_config.yml</code>:</li></ol><pre><code>pandoc:
  extensions:
    - normalize
    - smart
    - mathjax
    - csl: _styles/apa.csl
    - bibliography: bibliography/references.bib</code></pre><p>The DataCite blog uses the <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA citation style</a> and stores the references in BibTex format. Pandoc uses the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a>, so it is easy to switch to any of the 5000+ available styles.</p><ol><li>You can use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host the blog, but if you want to use <code>https</code>, and/or more flexibility with caching and domain names I recommend <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. Unless your blog sees a lot of traffic I doubt that the monthly cost is more than $2-5. One other advantage is that you don't have to deal with multiple git branches – which is how Github Pages stores the deployed website – as this can be confusing.</li><li>Jekyll is a static site generator, i.e. all blog pages are generated as HTML and no database backend is needed. You can build and deploy to S3 from your local computer, but I highly recommend to use a continuous integration tool for this. DataCite uses <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a>, which is free to use for open source projects. Travis CI has nice support for deployment to Amazon S3, rebuilding all pages and deploying to Amazon S3 takes about three minutes, and is triggered when we commit new code (e.g. a new blog post) to the <a href="https://github.com/datacite/blog">blog</a> git repository. For testing new features we deploy the <code>test</code> git branch to <a href="https://blog.test.datacite.org/">https://blog.test.datacite.org</a>.</li><li>Since the <code>1.15.2</code> release in November Pandoc supports <code>://</code> in citation keys. This makes it easy to generate consistent citation keys using the <code>URL</code> field as the key, in particular when sharing references with others. One nice side effect is that we can use this key (which Pandoc puts into the <code>data-cites</code> attribute of the generated HTML) to generate a link from the in-text citation with a little bit of Javascript, e.g. this one: (Cruse, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-blog-relaunch/#ref-https://blog.datacite.org/recap">2015</a>).</li></ol><p>This blog post is not only the last post on this blog in 2015, but also the 25th post since we launched this blog in August, a nice little milestone at the end of the year. We wish all readers a great start into the new year.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/xcbj-g7zy">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Cruse, T.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started as DataCite Technical Director four months ago, my first post (Fenner, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/tips-for-the-non-profit-startup/#ref-https://blog.datacite.org/data-driven-development">2015</a>) on this blog was about what I called <strong><strong>Data-Driven Development</strong></strong>. The post included a lot of ideas on how to approach development and technical infrastructure. In this post I want to take a second look.</p><p>While I think the ideas expressed in the blog post are still true, I also learned that the focus of a Technical Director working for a small non-profit is somewhere else. The main challenge might be to properly run infrastructure and technical development with limited resources, both in terms of staff and money. While DataCite isn't a startup (the organization turned six years old this month), we face many of the same challenges. And as a non-profit, we can't take the approach of the typical startup, which in the early stages might have a small staff, but usually can spend more money than it is taking in.</p><h3 id="automate-as-much-as-possible">Automate as much as possible</h3><p>The biggest cost is obviously staff, so it is very important to automate the technical infrastructure as much as possible. Luckily many powerful services and best practices have been developed in the last few years, under the umbrella term <a href="http://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/">DevOps</a>. The first step is to go with a cloud infrastructure provider rather than hosting your own servers. While the cost seems higher on paper, it is much easier to automate infrastructure using a cloud provider if you have a small technical team. DataCite infrastructure has been hosted by <strong><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong></strong> (AWS) since the beginning, and we currently see have no plans to change that.</p><p>A large number of tools integrate with AWS, three services that have become essential for DataCite in the past few months are <a href="https://terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> and <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/tips-for-the-non-profit-startup/">Chef</a>:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Terraform</strong></strong> treats infrastructure as code and allows us to have our AWS configuration (EC2 instances, Virtual Private Network, Security Groups, etc.) managed with a set of configuration files stored in a private git repo, e.g.</li></ul><pre><code>resource "aws_route_table" "production" {
    vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.production.id}"
    route {
        cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
        gateway_id = "${aws_internet_gateway.production.id}"
    }

    tags {
        Name = "production"
    }
}

resource "aws_main_route_table_association" "production" {
    vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.production.id}"
    route_table_id = "${aws_route_table.production.id}"
}

    subnet_id = "${aws_subnet.production.id}"
    route_table_id = "${aws_route_table.production.id}"
}

We use <a href="https://hashicorp.com/atlas.html">Atlas</a> (commercial, but free for small installations) to combine them into a web-based team workflow. We hope to complete the migration for all DataCite services in the coming months.</p><h3 id="think-carefully-about-build-vs-buy">Think carefully about Build vs. Buy</h3><p>A common approach in the commercial startup world is to focus on the particular product or service that the organization wants to build, and then outsource almost everything else. This is important when there is only a small number of staff and you want to move fast. While this approach also applies to non-profit organizations, the decision of <strong><strong>build vs. buy</strong></strong> will sometimes be different, because some of these outsourced services would just be too expensive, or create a lock-in that would be a problem later on.</p><p>But for the most part I think the risk of trying to build too much yourself is bigger, in particular since many external services have monthly plans, and there are often several alternatives. The biggest consideration is the risk of lock-in, which is of course what all service providers are aiming for.</p><h3 id="open-source-where-it-is-important">Open Source where it is important</h3><p>The software written by DataCite staff to run the DataCite services is all open source, hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/datacite">public Github repository</a>. This is important for a number of reasons, best explained in the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructures (Bilder, Lin, &amp; Neylon, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/tips-for-the-non-profit-startup/#ref-https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.1314859">2015</a>). One nice side effect is that a number of important external services are free for open source projects, for example Github or the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> continuous integration service.</p><p>What this doesn't mean is that all software that DataCite uses should be open source. I like the approach that ORCID has taken in the ORCID Principles (“Our principles,” <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/tips-for-the-non-profit-startup/#ref-https://orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid/principles">2011</a>):</p><blockquote>All software developed by ORCID will be publicly released under an Open Source Software license approved by the Open Source Initiative. For the software it adopts, ORCID will prefer Open Source.</blockquote><p>Some of the services mentioned above (e.g. Google Apps, Slack, AWS) are obviously not open source, and that is ok if they don't create a lock-in or serious dependency for running the DataCite infrastructure. An interesting approach is hosted open source software, such as this blog. We are currently paying <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost.org</a> a small amount of money to host the blog for us, but we can always move the blog somewhere else or start hosting it ourselves. Our use of AWS is more complex, but similar, all the software (databases, web servers, etc.) we are running is open source, and we can move to a different hosting provider if that is ever needed.</p><h3 id="get-non-profit-discounts">Get Non-Profit Discounts</h3><p>Some organizations provide their infrastructure services for free or a discount to non-profit organizations. DataCite started using <a href="https://apps.google.com/">Google Apps</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> in August. Both are free for eligible non-profits, for other services such as <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/nonprofit/office-365-nonprofit">Office 365</a> we get a deep discount.</p><p>Slack has become an essential internal communication tool. Not only because the current five staff members are in three different countries, but also because Slack nicely integrates with a large number of services. This greatly helps with keeping everyone on the same page.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/12/Bildschirmfoto-2015-12-23-um-11-26-47.png" class="kg-image" alt="Slack" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Slack</figcaption></figure><h3 id="start-small-but-make-changes-easy">Start small but make changes easy</h3><p>One trap you can fall into is to think too big when starting out. You should build or buy what you need now or in the near future. At the same time you should make sure that whatever solution you come up with will scale up when needed.</p><p>There are a number of services out there that provide wonderful value, but are not really appropriate for a small non-profit. They solve problems of much larger organizations, e.g. auto-scaling of servers or centralized data analytics.</p><h3 id="cooperate-with-other-non-profit-organizations">Cooperate with other non-profit organizations</h3><p>One important advantage that non-profits have over commercial startups is that it is easier for them to cooperate with other organizations. In the case of DataCite this primarily means with DataCite members and CrossRef.</p><p>Cooperation takes time and effort, and staff time is usually limited when you are a small organization and also have a lot of technical work on your plate. But it is still a worthwhile investment. And I think non-profit organizations in the scholarly communication space could cooperate much more. While there are many cooperations around specific projects and initiatives, I think most of the basics of running the organization, and the technical infrastructure in particular, are not really discussed much. Small non-profits such as DataCite face particular challenges that are different from both commercial organizations and larger non-profits such as academic institutions. I want to spend more time in 2016 working on this, so please contact me if you are interested to help.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/t0ap-d5w7">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Bilder, G., Lin, J., &amp; Neylon, C.

        <updated>2015-10-29T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Monday ORCID, CrossRef and DataCite announced (<a href="http://blog.orcid.org/blog/2015/10/26/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-next-level">ORCID post</a>, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-to-the-next-level/">CrossRef post</a>, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/auto-update-has-arrived/">DataCite post</a>) the new auto-update service that automatically pushes metadata to ORCID when an ORCID identifier is found in newly registered DOI names.</p><p>This is the first joint announcement by the three organizations, and shows the close collaboration between ORCID, CrossRef and DataCite. A good opportunity to learn more about these joint activities are the <a href="https://orcid.org/content/sf2015">ORCID Outreach Meeting in San Francisco</a> November 3-4, and the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual/archive/">CrossRef Annual Meeting in Boston</a> November 17-18.</p><p>As promised in the Monday blog post, I want to explain the DataCite implementation of the ORCID auto-update functionality in a separate blog post. To start with the bad news: the DataCite service isn't ready yet, and will launch in November. There are two reasons for this: CrossRef started to work on this functionality much earlier, and – more importantly – DataCite feels that we need to make some major architectural changes in our systems to implement this properly. The good news is that the architectural changes will give us a more solid foundation for additional features we can add over time. Let me explain the most important issues below.</p><h3 id="permissions">Permissions</h3><p>In order to update an ORCID record, an organization needs permission from the researcher who owns the record. These permissions can be short-lived for a specific update, or long-lived for many years. The latter is obviously the preferred option for the auto-update functionality.</p><p>DataCite is already collecting permissions to update ORCID records from our <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">Search and Link service</a> and we want to continue collecting permissions for the Auto-update service in the same place. To do this properly, we will launch a new Profiles service. It will act as a central place to interact with DataCite services. In the first version it will focus on ORCID permissions, but we can build this out over time with additional functionality. The service is currently under testing, we hope to launch <strong><strong>Labs Profiles</strong></strong> next week.</p><p>One unresolved issue with the current implementation is that DataCite has to use the same ORCID client credentials for both the Search and Link and Auto-update services. This makes it impossible to distinguish self-claims by a researcher coming in from the Search and Link service, and links coming in from the Auto-update service. CrossRef's has an ORCID membership that allows them to use separate client credentials for Search and Link and Auto-update. We are working with ORCID to solve this.</p><h3 id="multiple-sources">Multiple Sources</h3><p>Another challenge is the synchronization between the Search and Link and Auto-update services. ORCID records can contain multiple claims for the same DOI, e.g. from Search and Link, Auto-update, and possibly also other sources. Here is an example from my ORCID record with claims from Europe PubMed Central, CrossRef Metadata Search and Scopus:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-29-um-11-01-37.png" class="kg-image" alt="ORCID record" loading="lazy"><figcaption>ORCID record</figcaption></figure><p>It is important for DataCite to allow claims from multiple sources, and to show the provenance of every item in a person's ORCID record. The way the Search and Link service currently works (and <a href="http://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef Metadata Search</a> and <a href="http://search.test.datacite.org/">DataCite Labs Search</a> use the same <a href="https://github.com/crosscite/doi-metadata-search">codebase</a> for this) is that researchers can only add a claim to their ORCID records if that DOI is not yet claimed, even if the claim comes from another source. This is a pragmatic decision, as researchers will probably resort to self-claiming only for items that were not automatically added to their profiles. With the launch of Auto-update we need to rethink this approach, possibly allowing users to claim all works that have not yet been claimed via the Search and Link service.</p><h3 id="push-api">Push API</h3><p><a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953">Notifications</a> are an essential feature of ORCID's Auto-update. They allow CrossRef and DataCite to push information to the ORCID record of a person without prior permission. The ORCID record owner receives a message in his/her inbox and has the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept the claim(s).</p><p>The way DataCite's end is implemented results in an information push to ORCID whenever an ORCID is found in our metadata. There is a big overlap between this functionality and what we do in the Search and Link service: authentication with ORCID, background workers for processing, XML generation, error tracking, etc. Therefore we want to move this functionality to a centralised place, separate from the core Search and Link and Auto-update functionalities. While the current focus is on pushing information to ORCID, we could build similar notification services for other organizations in the future, e.g. pushing information to a funder whenever we find a grant identifier in newly issued DOI names. The above requires refactoring of the Search and Link code and it is currently underway.</p><h3 id="round-trip">Round-trip</h3><p>Auto-update is a milestone in automating the workflow of linking ORCID identifiers and DOI names. What is still missing is the opposite direction: telling publishers and data centres about links to their DOIs found in the ORCID registry, e.g. via self-claiming services such as Search and Link. This is relevant for already published works, and for publishers and data centres that have not yet integrated ORCID into their submission systems.</p><p>The ORCID registry focusses on a researcher view, i.e. the works associated with a particular researcher. We also need the inverse here, a service that shows all ORCID identifiers associated with a particular DOI. This information can be very helpful for publishers and data centres, as they can take this information, verify it, and add it to their internal systems and to the metadata they send to CrossRef or DataCite. DataCite is working with ORCID and CrossRef on this. We have aggregated this information for all 205,000 DataCite DOI names that are linked to at least one ORCID identifier. We found a total of about one million links (because most DOI names are linked to multiple ORCID identifiers) and a surprisingly small number of ORCID identifiers (about 2,500) responsibles for these one million links. Or maybe not so surprising if you remember <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/digging-into-data-using-r/">this August blog post</a>.</p><p>Please provide feedback regarding auto-update in the comments. We will follow-up with a new blog post in a few weeks when the DataCite Auto-update service has launched.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/3dfw-z4kq">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post has been cross-posted from the <a href="http://orcid.org/blog/2015/10/26/auto-update-has-arrived-orcid-records-move-next-level">ORCID blog</a>. We will follow up with a blog post later this week explaining the DataCite auto-update implementation.</em></p><p>Since ORCID’s inception, our key goal has been to unambiguously identify researchers and provide tools to automate the connection between researchers and their creative works. We are taking a big step towards achieving this goal today, with the launch of <a href="http://orcid.org/blog/2014/11/21/new-functionality-friday-auto-update-your-orcid-record">Auto-Update</a> functionality in collaboration with <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> and <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>.</p><p>There’s already been a lot of excitement about Auto-Update: <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-to-auto-update-orcid-records/">Crossref’s recent announcement</a> about the imminent launch generated a flurry of discussion and celebration on social media. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ORCID_Org/status/647020600192581633">tweet</a> on the topic was viewed over 10,500 times and retweeted by 60 other accounts.</p><p>So why all the fuss? We think Auto-Update will transform the way researchers manage their scholarly record. Until now, researchers have had to manually maintain their record, connecting new activities as they are made public. In ORCID, that meant using <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973653-Add-works-by-direct-import-from-other-systems">Search &amp; Link</a> tools developed by our member organizations to claim works manually. Researchers frequently ask, “Why, if I include my ORCID iD when I submit a manuscript or dataset, isn’t my ORCID record “automagically” updated when the work is published?”</p><p>With the launch of Auto-Update, that is just what will happen.</p><p><strong><strong>It might seem like magic but there are a few steps to make it work</strong></strong>:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Researchers</strong></strong>. You need to do two things: (1) use your ORCID iD when submitting a paper or dataset, and (2) authorize Crossref and DataCite to update your ORCID record. In keeping with our commitment to ensuring that researchers maintain full control of their ORCID record, you may revoke this permission at any time, and may also choose privacy settings for the information posted on your record.</li><li><strong><strong>Publishers and data centers</strong></strong>. These organizations also have two things to do: (1) collect ORCID identifiers during the submission workflow, using a process that involves authentication (not a type-in field!), and (2) embed the iD in the published paper and include the iD when submitting information to Crossref or DataCite.</li><li><strong><strong>Crossref and DataCite</strong></strong>. Upon receipt of data from a publisher or data center with a valid identifier, Crossref or DataCite can automatically push that information to the researcher’s ORCID record. More information about how to opt out of this service can be found here: <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953">the ORCID Inbox</a>.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/graph.png" class="kg-image" alt="Automagically" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Automagically</figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-is-this-so-revolutionary">Why is this so revolutionary?</h3><p>A bit of background, first. Crossref and DataCite, both non-profit organizations, are leaders in minting DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for research publications and datasets. A <a href="http://www.crossref.org/01company/16fastfacts.html#sthash.o7NGwOnP.dpuf">DOI</a> is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a digital object – in this case, an electronic journal article, book chapter, or a dataset. Each DOI is associated with a set of basic metadata and a URL pointer to the full text, so that it uniquely identifies the content item and provides a persistent link to its location on the internet.</p><p>Crossref, working with over a thousand scholarly publishers, has generated well over 75 million DOIs for journal articles and book chapters. DataCite works with nearly 600 data centers worldwide and has generated over 6.5 million DOIs to date. Between them, Crossref and DataCite have already received almost a half a million works from publishers and data centers that include an ORCID iD validated by the author/contributor. With Auto-Update functionality in place, information about these articles can transit (with the author’s permission) to the author’s ORCID record.</p><p>Auto-Update doesn’t stop at a researcher’s ORCID record. Systems that have integrated ORCID APIs and have a researcher’s ORCID record connected to that system -- their faculty profile system, library repository, webpage, funder reporting system -- can receive alerts from ORCID. Information can move easily and unambiguously across systems.</p><p>This is the beginning of the end for the endless rekeying of information that plagues researchers -- and anyone involved in research reporting. Surely something to celebrate!</p><p><strong><strong>Questions you may have</strong></strong>:</p><h4 id="q-what-do-i-need-to-do-to-sign-up-for-auto-update">Q. What do I need to do to sign up for auto-update?</h4><p>You need to grant permission to Crossref and DataCite to post information to your ORCID record. You can do this today by using the Search and Link wizard for DataCite available through the ORCID Registry or the <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite Search</a> page. We also have added a new ORCID Inbox, so that you can receive a message from Crossref or DataCite if they receive a datafile with your iD, and you can grant permission directly. See <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953">more on the ORCID Inbox</a>.</p><h4 id="q-will-crossref-and-datacite-be-able-to-update-my-orcid-record-with-already-published-works-for-which-i-did-not-use-my-orcid-id">Q. Will Crossref and DataCite be able to update my ORCID record with already published works for which I did not use my ORCID iD?</h4><p>No. The auto-update process only applies to those works that these organizations receive that include your ORCID iD. For previous works that did not include your ORCID iD, you will need to use the DataCite and Crossref Search and Link wizards to connect information with your iD.</p><h4 id="q-what-information-will-be-posted-to-my-record">Q. What information will be posted to my record?</h4><p>With your permission, basic information about the article (such as title, list of contributors, journal or publisher) or dataset (such as data center name and date of publication) will be posted, along with a DOI that allows users to navigate to the source paper or dataset landing page.</p><h4 id="q-what-if-my-journal-or-data-center-doesn%E2%80%99t-collect-orcid-ids">Q. What if my journal or data center doesn’t collect ORCID iDs?</h4><p>Ask them too! This simple step can be accomplished using either the Public or Member ORCID APIs. Information about integrating ORCID iDs in <a href="http://members.orcid.org/publisher-workflow">publishing</a> and <a href="http://members.orcid.org/repository-systems">repository</a> workflows is publicly available.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/ferw-cwhq">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago today Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) launched its service at the Outreach Meeting in Berlin.

</figure><p>Executive Director Laure Haak was written a nice <a href="http://orcid.org/blog/2015/10/15/celebrating-our-third-anniversary">blog post</a> summarizing the achievements in the past few years, going from 0 to 1.7 million registered users, 400 members and a staff of 20. Congratulations!</p><p>On October 17, a day after the ORCID launch, DataCite started to work with ORCID in the European Commission-funded ORCID and DataCite Interoperability Network <a href="http://odin-project.eu/">ODIN</a>, a project that has laid the groundwork for the integration of both the two services, and associated datasets. DataCite is continuing work with ORCID in the follow-up project <a href="http://project-thor.eu/">THOR</a> that started in June, and there will soon be an exciting announcement about a new integration of the two services.</p><p>This birthday has a special meaning for me, as I was a member of the ORCID Board at the time, and had helped organize the launch event in Berlin, as well as the kickoff meeting of the ODIN project, and a well-attended German-language <a href="https://dini.de/veranstaltungen/workshops/autorenidentifikation/">event on author identification</a> in the same venue two days before the launch, co-organized by <a href="https://dini.de/">DINI</a> and the Helmholtz Association.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This blog post provides more detail for a short presentation I will give today at the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/software-credit">Software Credit Workshop</a> in London. The aim is to look at the infrastructure pieces needed for software discovery and credit, and at the workflows linking these different parts of the infrastructure.</em></p><h3 id="code-repository">Code Repository</h3><p>Code repositories are the places where the actual work on software takes place, and for scientific software this often means that it happens in public with the use of an open license. Code repositories are increasingly integrated with additional services from issue trackers to continuous integration testing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/code_repositories.png" class="kg-image" alt="Code repositories" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Code repositories</figcaption></figure><p>One big problem with code repositories is that they are not intended as long-term archives for code. Github and Bitbucket didn't even exist 8 years ago, and Google Code will be <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">shut down in January 2016</a>.</p><h3 id="data-repository">Data Repository</h3><p>Long-term archiving of software is best done in dedicated data repositories, the two most popular in terms of DataCite DOIs are <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> (close to <a href="https://search.datacite.org/?query=%2A&amp;resourceType_facet=Software&amp;datacentre_facet=CERN.ZENODO+-+ZENODO+-+Research.+Shared.">5000</a> DOIs for software) and <a href="https://nanohub.org/">NanoHub</a> (about <a href="https://search.datacite.org/?query=%2A&amp;resourceType_facet=Software&amp;datacentre_facet=PURDUE.EZID+-+Purdue+University">2,000</a> DOIs for software). NanoHub uses the open source <a href="https://hubzero.org/">HubZero</a> software that integrates a subversion code repository, whereas Zenodo has built an integration with Github, described in this <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">guide</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-18-um-14-01-39.png" class="kg-image" alt="Making your code citable" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Making your code citable</figcaption></figure><p>Providing a long-term archive for code is needed to properly cite software, similarly to what we expect for research data and scholarly articles. We of course don't have to use DOIs for this, but DOIs make citation easier by requiring basic citation metadata, are supported by reference managers, and we can provide formatted citations via <a href="http://www.crosscite.org/">DOI content negotiation</a>, e.g. in <a href="https://search.datacite.org/?query=10.5281/ZENODO.32193">DataCite Labs Search</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-18-um-13-59-34.png" class="kg-image" alt="Citation style" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Citation style</figcaption></figure><p>The Github/Zenodo integration assigns a DOI to a particular <a href="https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software">Github release</a> of a software repo. This is perfect for a citation, which should be specific for the software version used in a particular research project. In addition, users of software and software authors want to know who is citing or otherwise re-using all versions of the software. In order for this to work we need to think beyond a specific release and link that release to other releases and to the Github repository itself. The repository has no DOI attached to it in the current workflow, so this has to be done in a service separate from the DataCite Metadata Store.</p><h3 id="claim-store">Claim Store</h3><p>We can expand the DataCite Data-Level Metrics service or Claim Store <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-data-level-metrics-in-datacite-labs/">described in an earlier post</a> to properly handle Github repositories, and the first implementation is <a href="https://eventdata.test.datacite.org/">available now</a> in DataCite Labs. Continuing with the earlier example of the Python <strong><strong>librosa</strong></strong> library, the DataCite Claim store tracks links between release, repository and repository owner:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-18-um-17-07-48.png" class="kg-image" alt="Claim store" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Claim store</figcaption></figure><p>These links are made available in DataCite Labs Search (<a href="https://search.datacite.org/?query=librosa+python">link</a>), so that users can go directly to either the specific release or the code repository landing page instead of the archived version on Zenodo:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-18-um-17-40-51.png" class="kg-image" alt="Zenodo" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Zenodo</figcaption></figure><p>We can use the claim store to not only store those links, but also to track metrics around the software package over time, e.g. the number of Github stars and forks (349 and 68 for a combined 417 in this case):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-18-um-17-11-46.png" class="kg-image" alt="GitHub" loading="lazy"><figcaption>GitHub</figcaption></figure><p>We will be building out this service in the coming months with the goal of tracking all software packages with DOIs linked to a Github release. Future iterations may also show the number of Github stars and forks directly in the search results. And because the Claim Store provides an open API, this information can also be integrated in other places, most obviously Zenodo.</p><h3 id="language-and-domain-repository">Language and Domain Repository</h3><p>Language-specific repositories hold all software packages from a particular language, e.g. <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi</a> for Python or <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> for R, with a search interface for discovery and a specific format that allows for automatic installation. Although not all scientific software is submitted to these repositories, they are usually the place that software developers go to first for discovery and installation, using a package manager working with these repositories.</p><p>Domain-specific repositories such as the Astrophysics Source Code Library (<a href="http://ascl.net/">ASCL</a>) or <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> serve important roles for discovery and community building. Both their strength and limitation is their domain-specific nature. They complement the source code repositories mentioned above. One important function of domain-specific repositories is to act as a filter for scientific software. Other approaches to identify software as scientific include:</p><ul><li>software that has a DOI (Zenodo, above)</li><li>software using specific tags (Depsy, see below)</li><li>software cited in the scholarly literature (ScienceToolbox)</li></ul><h3 id="metrics-data-provider">Metrics Data Provider</h3><p>Language-specific repositories provide the detailed information that is needed to more extensively track reuse of a software package. <a href="http://depsy.org/">Depsy</a> is a new software metrics data provider by the Impactstory Team that will launch later this month, and will provide detailed information about reuse, including citations in the scholarly literature. Again using <strong><strong>librosa</strong></strong> as an example, Depsy provides the following information:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-18-um-12-14-48.png" class="kg-image" alt="Depsy" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Depsy</figcaption></figure><p>Of particular interest is how Depsy tracks reuse, as the service follows all the dependencies and dependencies of dependencies of a software package, described as transitive credit by Dan Katz (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/software-citation-workflows/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.be">2014</a>). Depsy is currently tracking software packages in <strong><strong>pypi</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>CRAN</strong></strong>, and an open API is available. Once Depsy has launched, it would of course be of great interest to integrate data from the service into the DataCite Claim Store, and Depsy is providing an open API for this.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/1h7n-3cen">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Katz, D.

One of problems identified in the report was the use of a single entry field for personal names, as done by DataCite and many other scholarly services. We need separate fields for family and given names, the most important reason is to allow proper formatting of a data citation (different citation styles have different rules about author name formatting). As a small first step I have implemented proper personal name parsing, using the <a href="https://github.com/berkmancenter/namae">Namae</a> tool, in <a href="http://search.test.datacite.org/">DataCite Labs Search</a> and the upcoming <a href="http://eventdata.test.datacite.org/">DataCite Labs claim store</a>. One of the next places we can implement this is in the DOI content negotiation service, where we currently provide personal names as literal strings when using an output format that supports family and given names (<a href="http://data.crosscite.org/application/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.791569">http://data.crosscite.org/application/citeproc+json/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.791569</a>):</p><pre><code>{

}</code></pre><p>To correctly identify contributors we have to use unique identifiers rather than personal names. The Force11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (Data Citation Synthesis Group, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/contributor-information-in-datacite-metadata/#ref-https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk">2014</a>) highlight the importance of unique identifiers for data, and I had suggested in an early draft of the principles to also mention the importance of unique identifiers for contributors.</p><p><a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> identifiers are by far the most widely used identifiers in DataCite metadata – they can be found in the metadata of about <a href="https://search.test.datacite.org/?query=nameIdentifier%3AORCID%5C%3A*">208,000 DOI names</a> (other identifiers such as ISNI are also supported). In addition there are self-claims of DataCite DOI names in the ORCID registry (e.g. generated via the DataCite Search &amp; Link Service that is part of <a href="https://search.test.datacite.org/">Labs Search</a>), the exact number of which we currently don't know. DataCite is working with ORCID on a frictionless exchange of these DataCite/ORCID links in both directions.</p><p>But how are these DataCite/ORCID links shared with other services? A good starting point is the DataCite Search API. We can include <code>creator</code> and <code>nameIdentifier</code> in the results, but unfortunately these two fields are not linked together. Until we update the Solr schema for the Search API we therefore have to use the <code>xml</code> field that includes all metadata, and parse out the creator names and associated identifiers. We have recently implemented this in Labs Search, turning names with associated ORCID identifiers into clickable links that return a list of all DataCite DOI names associated with that person (<a href="http://search.test.datacite.org/?query=10.6084%2FM9.FIGSHARE.791569">http://search.test.datacite.org/?query=10.6084%2FM9.FIGSHARE.791569</a>):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-12-um-08-30-30.png" class="kg-image" alt="Link name via ORCID ID" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Link name via ORCID ID</p><p>Labs Search also provides a <strong><strong>Cite</strong></strong> button that formats the metadata according to common citation styles such as <strong><strong>APA</strong></strong>, or in common exchange formats such as <strong><strong>BibTeX</strong></strong>. These formats unfortunately don't support ORCID identifiers (nothing has changed since I wrote about this in 2011), so that the DataCite/ORCID links would be lost using these formats.</p><p>Citeproc JSON is a modern alternative to BibTeX, RIS and similar exchange formats, and is used as the machine-readable representation to format references in the reference managers Zotero, Mendeley, Papers (and others) using <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a>. Although Citeproc JSON doesn't support ORCID identifiers, it is much easier to extend than for example BibTeX, where adding ORCID identifiers without breaking the format is difficult to impossible. Last week I implemented this modified Citeproc JSON in a new DataCite service I am working on (e.g. using the example from above:</p><pre><code>"author": [{
      "family": "Chamberlain",
      "given": "Scott",
      "ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1444-9135"

      "ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1642-628X"
    }]</code></pre><p>DataCite is not the first DOI registration agency to implement this, CrossRef is doing the same for some time in their REST API, e.g. for <a href="http://api.crossref.org/works/10.1111/1365-2745.12293">http://api.crossref.org/works/10.1111/1365-2745.12293</a>:</p><pre><code>"author": [{

}]</code></pre><p>You see one difference: CrossRef also provides the affiliation, as a list of text fields. DataCite metadata also contain an <code>affiliation</code> field. This is a text string, ideally DataCite should also support unique identifiers for the affiliation, as we already do for <code>HostingInstitution</code> which can have a <code>nameIdentifier</code> and <code>nameIdentifierScheme</code>.</p><p>Funding information is similar to affiliation in that it is something not related to the dataset itself, but to one or more contributors. We could therefore encode funding information similar to affiliation, as a <code>funding</code> field for each author. The big advantage would be that DataCite and ORCID would have consisting funding information, rather than DataCite listing funding for works, and ORCID listing funding for people, and no direct connection between the two.</p><p>Lastly, we can use Citeproc JSON to describe the contributor role of the author. DataCite distinguishes between <code>creator</code> – <em>the main researchers involved in producing the data, or the authors of the publication, in priority order</em> – and <code>contributor</code> for other contributions, with a controlled vocabulary for <code>contributorType</code>. The THOR report mentioned above (Fenner et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/contributor-information-in-datacite-metadata/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.30799">2015</a>) goes into detail in the different contributor role vocabularies used by DataCite and ORCID (there is little overlap), and also describes <a href="https://www.casrai.org/credit.html">Project CRediT</a>, a community initiative to harmonize contributor roles across stakeholders, standardizing on 14 common roles. CRediT is closely link to <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/contributorship-badges-a-new-project">contributorship badges</a>, a project started by the Mozilla Science Lab, with an example journal article using the CRediT roles and badges <a href="http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/putting-credit-hands-researchers/">here</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/10/Bildschirmfoto-2015-10-12-um-09-39-34.png" class="kg-image" alt="Contributor badges" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Contributor badges</figcaption></figure><p>Taking all the above together, the JSON to describe all this information could look similar to the following (some of the data are made up):</p><pre><code>"author": [{

    }]</code></pre><p>The above obviously contains a lot more information than the original Citeproc JSON. And event though <code>affiliation</code>, <code>funding</code> and <code>CRediT</code> are optional fields, this goes beyond the scope of Citeproc JSON, which is used to format references, rather than as a generic bibliographic exchange format. We should therefore call this JSON differently, and I propose <strong><strong>Crosscite JSON</strong></strong>, a common JSON format to describe scholarly works used by the DOI registration agencies CrossRef and DataCite. One particular challenge will be to strike the right balance between important information that we want to share easily, vs. keeping the JSON simple and not move away too much from Citeproc JSON, which after all is already implemented in a lot of tools and workflows. While the above JSON example looks a bit scary at first, it provides the level of detail asked for by institutions and funders, and - in contrast to the Data Citation Principles - <em>uses a single mechanism of attribution applicable to all scholarly works, including data</em>.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/d98m-9125">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Data Citation Synthesis Group.

        <updated>2015-10-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my personal highlights in last week's Research Data Alliance (RDA) <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/plenary-meetings/rda-sixth-plenary-meeting.html">6th Plenary Meeting</a> in Paris was the <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/data-packages-bof-p6-bof-session.html">Data Packages</a> Birds of a Feather (BoF), organized by <a href="http://rufuspollock.org/">Rufus Pollock</a> from the Open Knowledge Foundation (<a href="https://okfn.org/">OKFN</a>). He highlighted the urgent need for packacking data in a standard format to facilitate reuse, and described the extensive work the OKFN has done on <a href="http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package">data packages</a>. A particular focus is on packacking CSV files, the most widely used format for exchanging data.</p><p>I was sold on the importance of CSV and the idea of packacking data in a standard format since attending <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2014/05/05/csv-conf-2014.html">CSVconf</a> (co-organized by Rufus) in July 2014, and have written about this several times (<a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/07/18/roads-not-stagecoaches/">Build Roads not Stagecoaches</a>, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/reference-lists-and-tables-of-content/">Reference Lists and Tables of Content</a>), most recently a few weeks ago (<a href="https://blog.datacite.org/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/">Using YAML frontmatter with CSV</a>). In the RDA session I suggested two important improvements for the OKFN data package format:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Single file.</strong></strong> One very important aspect of packaging is to provide everything in a single file, generated by zipping a folder of multiple files. This pattern has become very common and is used for example for electronic books (<code>epub</code>), Microsoft Word documents (<code>docx</code>), or <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging">Google Chrome extensions</a> (<code>crx</code>).</li><li><strong><strong>Identifier</strong></strong>. The OKFN data package spec uses a <code>name</code> attribute to uniquely identify the package. This approach falls short because enforcing the uniqueness of a human readable identifier requires a registry, and this not part of the data package spec. What is needed is a persistent identifier, and DataCite obviously has a lot of experience in this area.</li></ul><p>Container-based digital infrastructure is a very hot topic thanks to <a href="https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker">Docker</a>, and it has become clear that tools and workflows are at least as important as the spec for the container itself. If we want to move to scholarly infrastructure based on containers, used here interchangeably with packages, we need registries for these containers that not only provide globally unique identifiers, but also a central index for finding these containers - the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> for scholarly containers. DataCite is providing persistent identifiers and standardized metadata for scholarly content with a focus on research data and is therefore in a perfect position to become such a registry and in the RDA session I therefore said:</p><blockquote>I want DataCite to become a registry for data containers</blockquote><p>While data, in particular in CSV format, are probably the first and most important use case, containers make sense for all scholarly content, and DataCite DOIs are used for text documents, images, software, etc. in addition to datasets. For this reason I prefer the term <strong><strong>scholarly container</strong></strong> over <strong><strong>data container</strong></strong>.</p><p>As important as the containers themselves are tools and services that work with them, in particular packing and unpacking. The <code>CSVY</code> format discussed here in a <a href="http://blog.datacite.org/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv/">recent blog post</a> could be used by an individual as intermediate step towards a data container. I see tool support as the critical step that decides whether scholarly containers take off as a standard format. Karthik Ram from <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> attended the session in Paris (and CSV.conf last year) and expressed great interest in adding support for scholarly containers in their suite of tools.</p><h4 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h4><ul><li>specify the work needed for DataCite to fully support scholarly containers</li><li>work with Rufus and OKFN, e.g. on registry support and packaging into a single file</li><li>work with the broader community on supporting scholarly containers: data repositories, reference managers, tools to analyze datasets, etc.</li><li>propose a pre-conference workshop for the <a href="https://www.force11.org/event/force2016-mark-your-calendars">Force2016 conference</a> in April 2016. This conference started out as Beyond the PDF in 2011, and scholarly containers are a perfect thematic fit.</li></ul><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/d9eq-9dga">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-sixth-plenary-meeting-paris-france">Research Data Alliance 6th Plenary</a> last week discussed numerous topics very relevant to DataCite. Below is a short subjective list of topics I found interesting. If you attended RDA, feel free to add your thoughts in the comments. And if you didn't attend, you can still provide feedback.</p><h3 id="interoperability-between-persistent-identifiers">Interoperability between Persistent Identifiers</h3><p>The <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/ig-pid-p6-meeting-session.html">Persistent Identifiers IG</a> discussed the different persistent identifier activities in various RDA working and interest groups. The EC-funded <a href="http://project-thor.eu/">THOR</a> project that started in June was presented by Josh Brown from ORCID and Trisha Cruse from DataCite. I presented the DataCite perspective on persistent identifier interoperability. One important shortcoming of many persistent identifiers including DataCite DOI names is that only one organization – the publisher - can update the metadata. What is also needed is a <strong><strong>claim store</strong></strong> where multiple organizations and not just the publisher can deposit links between different persistent identifiers, e.g. citations, funding information, ORCID identifiers, etc. CrossRef and DataCite are working on such a claim store (more info <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-data-level-metrics-in-datacite-labs/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/det-poised-for-launch/">here</a>).</p><h3 id="data-repository-registries">Data repository registries</h3><p>Several sessions discussed repositories that collect information about data repositories. <a href="http://www.re3data.org/">re3data</a> is one of the more important initiatives in this space, and <a href="http://www.re3data.org/2015/05/datacite-to-manage-and-develop-re3data-org/">will become a DataCite service in 2016</a>. One critical step is <a href="http://www.re3data.org/2015/08/introduction-of-the-re3data-org-persistent-identifier/">persistent identifiers for data repositories</a> that are used across data services, including the DataCite Metadata Store.</p><h3 id="dynamic-data-citation">Dynamic Data Citation</h3><p>Unfortunately I missed the session of the <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/wg-data-citation-p6-meeting-session.html">Data Citation WG</a> - I presented in the parallel <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/wg-rdawds-publishing-data-bibliometrics-p6-meeting-session.html">RDA/WDS Publishing Data Bibliometrics WG</a>. But I had interesting discussions about this topic durig the coffee breaks. I need to better understand the proposed solutions and how they fit into DataCite's existing infrastructure.</p><h3 id="data-packages">Data Packages</h3><p>The <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/data-packages-bof-p6-bof-session.html">Data packages BoF</a> was organized by Rufus Pollock from the Open Knowledge Foundation (<a href="https://okfn.org/">OKFN</a>), and he kindly invited me to present my perspective. This is an exciting topic and look for more on this topic in a future blog post.</p><h3 id="publishing-data-services">Publishing Data Services</h3><p>The <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/wg-rdawds-publishing-data-services-p6-meeting-session.html">RDA/WDS Publishing Data Services</a> presented their work on a data - literature <a href="https://dliservice.research-infrastructures.eu/">linking service</a>. DataCite has worked closely with CrossRef on this topic since last year, and it was good to see a lot of overlap in the approaches taken, e.g. using the <code>relationType</code> vocabulary from the DataCite Metadata Schema.</p><h3 id="data-citation">Data Citation</h3><p>On the last day of RDA I gave a short presentation in the <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/ig-rdawds-publishing-data-p6-joint-session.html">Joint meeting of RDA/WDS Publishing Data WGs and IGs</a>, summarizing some of the challenges implementing data citation:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="804df2be5af148ffa0a048c0777d75ee" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In the session we had a good discussion on how to move forward with the work started by the working group and its various interest groups.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/7rxd-s8a3">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the first tasks for DataCite in the European Commission-funded <a href="http://project-thor.eu/">THOR project</a>, which started in June, was to contribute to a comparison of the ORCID and DataCite metadata standards. Together with ORCID, CERN, the British Library and Dryad we looked at how contributors, organizations and artefacts - and the relations between them - are described in the respective metadata schemata, and how they are implemented in two example data repositories, <a href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/">Archaeology Data Service</a> and <a href="https://www.datadryad.org/">Dryad Digital Repository</a>.</p><p>The focus of our work was on identifying major gaps. Our report was finished and made publicly available last week (Fenner et al., <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/differences-between-orcid-and-datacite-metadata/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.30799">2015</a>). The key findings are summarized below:</p><ul><li>Common Approach to Personal Names</li><li>Standardized Contributor Roles</li><li>Standardized Relation Types</li><li>Metadata for Organisations</li><li>Persistent Identifiers for Projects</li><li>Harmonization of ORCID and DataCite Metadata</li></ul><h3 id="common-approach-to-personal-names">Common Approach to Personal Names</h3><p>While a single input field for contributor names is common, separate fields for given and family names are required for <a href="http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html#names">proper formatting of citations</a>. As long as citations to scholarly content rely on properly formatted text rather than persistent identifiers, services holding bibliographic information have to support these separate fields. Further work is needed to help with the transition to separate input fields for given and famliy names, and to handle contributors that are organizations or groups of people.</p><h3 id="standardized-contributor-roles">Standardized Contributor Roles</h3><p>The currently existing vocabularies for <strong><strong>contributor type</strong></strong> (DataCite) and <strong><strong>contributor role</strong></strong> (ORCID) provide a high-level description, but fall short when trying to describe the author/creator contribution in more detail. <a href="http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT">Project CRediT</a> is a multi-stakeholder initiative that has developed a common vocabulary with 14 different contributor roles, and this vocabulary can be used to provide this detail, e.g. who provided resources such as reagents or samples, who did the statistical analysis, or who contributed to the methodology of a study.</p><p>CRediT is complementary to existing contributor role vocabularies such as those by ORCID and DataCite. For contributor roles it is particularly important that the same vocabulary is used across stakeholders, so that the roles described in the data center can be forwarded first to DataCite, then to ORCID, and then also to other places such as institutional repositories.</p><h3 id="standardized-relation-types">Standardized Relation Types</h3><p>Capturing relations between scholarly works such as datasets in a standardized way is important, as these relations are used for citations and thus the basis for many indicators of scholarly impact. Currently used vocabularies for relation types between scholarly works, e.g. by CrossRef and DataCite, only partly overlap. In addition we see differences in community practices, e.g. some scholars but not others reserve the term citation for links between two scholarly articles. The term data citation is sometimes used for all links from scholarly works to datasets, but other times reserved for formal citations appearing in reference lists.</p><h3 id="metadata-for-organisations">Metadata for Organisations</h3><p>Both ORCID and DataCite not only provide persistent identifiers for people and data, but they also collect metadata around these persistent identifiers, in particular links to other identifiers. The use of persistent identifiers for organizations lags behind the use of persistent identifiers for research outputs and people, and more work is needed.</p><h3 id="persistent-identifiers-for-projects">Persistent Identifiers for Projects</h3><p>Research projects are collaborative activities among contributors that may change over time. Projects have a start and end date and are often funded by a grant. The existing persistent identifier (PID) infrastructure does support artefacts, contributors and organisations, but there is no first-class PID support for projects. This creates a major gap that becomes obvious when we try to describe the relationships between funders, contributors and research outputs.</p><p>Both the ORCID and DataCite metadata support funding information, but only as direct links to contributors or research outputs, respectively. This not only makes it difficult to exchange funding information between DataCite and ORCID, but also fails to adequately model the sometimes complex relationships, e.g. when multiple funders and grants were involved in supporting a research output. We therefore not only need persistent identifiers for projects, but also infrastructure for collecting and aggregating links to contributors and artefacts.</p><h3 id="harmonization-of-orcid-and-datacite-metadata">Harmonization of ORCID and DataCite Metadata</h3><p>We identified significant differences between the ORCID and DataCite metadata schema, and these differences hinder the flow of information between the two services. Several different approaches to overcome these differences are conceivable:</p><ol><li>only use a common subset, relying on linked persistent identifiers to get the full metadata</li><li>harmonize the ORCID and DataCite metadata schemata</li><li>common API exchange formats for metadata</li></ol><p>The first approach is the linked open data approach, and was designed specifically for scenarios like this. One limitation is that it requires persistent identifiers for all relevant attributes (e.g. for every creator/contributor in the DataCite metadata). One major objective for THOR is therefore to increase the use of persistent identifiers, both by THOR partners, and by the community at large.</p><p>A common metadata schema between ORCID and DataCite is neither feasible nor necessarily needed. In addition, we have to also consider interoperability with other metadata standards (e.g. CASRAI, OpenAIRE, COAR), and with other artifacts, such as those having CrossRef DOIs. What is more realistic is harmonization across a limited set essential metadata.</p><p>The third approach to improve interoperability uses a common API format that includes all the metadata that need to be exchanged, but doesn’t require the metadata schema itself to change. This approach was <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-and-datacite-unify-support-for-http-content-negotiation/">taken by DataCite and CrossRef a few years ago</a> to provide metadata for DOIs in a consistent way despite significant differences in the CrossRef and DataCite metadata schema. Using HTTP content negotiation, metadata are provided in a variety of formats.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/bc11-cqw1">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Fenner, M., Demeranville, T., Kotarski, R., Vision, T., Rueda, L., Dasler, R., … THOR Consortium.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We launched this blog six weeks ago on a hosted version of <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, the open source blogging platform. Ghost doesn't have all the features of Wordpress or other more mature blogging platforms, but it is a pleasure to use. The other alternative would have been to put the blog up on the Drupal-based main <a href="http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite website</a>, but Drupal is really a content-management system and usually not the best choice for a serious blog.</p><p>What all the above systems (Ghost, Wordpress, Drupal) have in common is that they need a web server and database backend. This is fine for the standard blog, but it becomes a problem once you start thinking about customizing your blog. In the case of the DataCite blog I want to be able to provide the following:</p><ul><li>the addition of proper citations and references</li><li>a PDF (and possibly ePub) version for downloading and archiving</li><li>a register blog posts with a DOI</li></ul><p>Since DataCite is in the business of providing DOI names for scholarly content, the above is a pretty obvious wish list. Some people might argue about the content of this blog needing a DOI, but DOIs have been used for similar content for many years, whether it is for frontmatter content (editorials, opinion pieces, etc.) in journals, or in services such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/news">Nature News</a>.</p><p>Out of the box the standard blogging platforms mentioned above don't support references or DOI registration, so a bit of extra work is needed. The easiest way to do this is to switch to a simpler blogging platform. Luckily there are a lot of choices among these so-called <strong><strong>static site generators</strong></strong>, which don't need a database and simply generate HTML files. Adding the features from the above wish list then becomes a straightforward process and that is what I have started doing.</p><p>As of this week, we support references, as you can see in this blog post(<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>) from two weeks ago.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/09/Bildschirmfoto-2015-09-15-um-20-19-48.png" class="kg-image" alt="References" loading="lazy"><figcaption>References</figcaption></figure><p>The picture is from the PDF version of the post, where the integration with the blog is still ongoing.</p><p>The <em>DataCite Labs Blog</em> looks very similar to the <em>DataCite Blog</em>, but under the hood is using the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> static site generator, and the <a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html">Pandoc</a> document conversion software. This is a popular combination used by several scholarly bloggers, e.g. <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/07/automated-knitr-in-jekyll.html">Carl Boettiger</a>. Jekyll is written in Ruby, and there are at least two Ruby gems that allow automatic deposition in Zenodo (<a href="https://github.com/sprotocols/zenodo">zenodo gem</a>), or the DataCite Metadata Store (<a href="https://github.com/datacite/datacite_doi_ify">datacite_doi_ify gem</a>) to automate archiving and DOI registration.</p><p>Of course DOI registration doesn't all of the sudden make blog content more ​​<em>scholarly</em>​, but it can make it easier to find. For example, blog posts can be found by searching CrossRef or DataCite's metadata, and links can be discovered between blog posts and scholarly articles (or datasets) by using the DataCite metrics pilot, which we <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/announcing-data-level-metrics-in-datacite-labs">announced last week</a>. To facilitate this we need to deposit the references with the metadata we send to DataCite, e.g. for the three scholarly articles, one software repository, one dataset and one data paper you see in the picture above.</p><p>A little more work is needed before the <em>Labs Blog</em> can become the official <em>DataCite Blog</em>, and as always we appreciate your feedback. The blog itself is stored in a <a href="https://github.com/datacite/blog">public Github repository</a>, so feel free to reuse any of the code. We use the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> continuous integration tool to automatically generate the HTML pages for the blog, and then push the newly generated HTML content to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for hosting.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/2wfx-2hz1">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week Jennifer Lin shared information on the <strong><strong>Making Data Count</strong></strong> (MDC) project <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/when-counting-is-hard/">on this blog</a>. MDC is a project funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) to design and develop metrics that track and measure data use – <strong><strong>data-level metrics</strong></strong> (DLM).</p><p>Funding for the 12 month project ends October 1st, with a no-cost extension until March 1st. MDC is a research project and has delivered some interesting questions and important results. One open question is whether and how to turn MDC research into a service that is not limited to the grant-funding period and possibly includes other datasets beyond those from the <a href="https://www.dataone.org/current-member-nodes">DataONE repository network</a>. These important decisions require analysis and feedback from the broader community.</p><p>In order to better understand and analyze these questions DataCite has taken over hosting of the DLM service from PLOS and will provide this service until at least March 1st, when the MDC funding formally ends. The DLM service is now hosted by DataCite Labs and can be found at <a href="https://dlm.datacite.org/">https://dlm.datacite.org</a>. The following chart (directly from <a href="https://dlm.datacite.org/sources">https://dlm.datacite.org/sources</a>) gives an overview about the data we have collected so far:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/09/Bildschirmfoto-2015-09-09-um-17-02-56.png" class="kg-image" alt="Works with events" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Works with events</figcaption></figure><p>DLM is primarily an API for metrics, with documentation found at <a href="https://dlm.datacite.org/docs/sources">https://dlm.datacite.org/docs/sources</a>, and live API documentation at <a href="https://dlm.datacite.org/api">https://dlm.datacite.org/api</a>. API clients in <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/alm">R</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lagotto/pyalm">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto-rb">Ruby</a> exist, and there is <a href="https://github.com/lagotto/almviz">example code</a> in Javascript. A discussion forum helps with questions regarding the API or clients.</p><p>Most users will not be using the API directly, but rather want to see the metrics data displayed together with the datasets they are interested in. About half of the about 140,000 datasets in the DLM service use DataCite DOIs and, as a first step, we have integrated DataCite DOIs into <a href="https://search.test.datacite.org/">Labs Search</a>. If your search results include datasets from one of the DataONE data centers that use DOIs (including Long Term Ecological Research Network, National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and Dryad Digital Repository) and we have found links for them (e.g. for <a href="https://search.datacite.org/works?query=10.5061/dryad.f1cb2">10.5061/dryad.f1cb2</a>), we will display them:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/09/Bildschirmfoto-2015-09-09-um-17-18-36.png" class="kg-image" alt="Data from: rise of the machines" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Data from: rise of the machines</p><p>Let's dig into the Dryad example a bit more -- every Dryad data package is associated with a journal article (or other textual output) and the metadata deposited in DataCite links to that particular article. Dryad has provided <code>Is referenced by</code> for this relationship:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/09/Bildschirmfoto-2015-09-09-um-17-21-42.png" class="kg-image" alt="Show &quot;isReferencedBy&quot; relationship" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Show "isReferencedBy" relationship</p><p>When you click on the <code>Is Cited By</code> link you will find 6 citations, all of which are different from the article in the <code>Is referenced by</code> link.</p><p>We included the names of the data sources (e.g. Europe PMC, PLOS, etc.) to distinguish DataCite metadata from external data pulled in from DLM. We are not currently deduplicating links if they are found in different sources - in this case two citations where found both via PLOS fulltext search and via Europe PMC API:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/09/Bildschirmfoto-2015-09-09-um-17-21-21.png" class="kg-image" alt="PLOS fulltext search and Europe PMC" loading="lazy"></figure><p>PLOS fulltext search and Europe PMC</p><p>Although citations in the scholarly literature are the most interesting links the DLM service can discover, DLM also searches other data sources such as the bookmarking service <a href="http://citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>, the <a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> registry of personal author identifiers, and Wikipedia (in this case for <a href="http://search.datacite.org/?query=10.5061/DRYAD.868SM%5D">10.5061/DRYAD.868SM</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/09/Bildschirmfoto-2015-09-09-um-17-33-21.png" class="kg-image" alt="Data from: ontogeny, morphology and taxonomy" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Data from: ontogeny, morphology and taxonomy</p><p>We hope you find this information useful when you use <a href="http://search.test.datacite.org/">Labs Search</a>, but there still remains a lot of work to do, including:</p><ul><li>display numerical data, e.g. download counts or Mendeley readers,</li><li>integrate the DLM data into the search index, so that we can use the data for filtering and sorting, e.g. <em>show me all datasets from data center x that have been cited at least 3 times</em>),</li><li>harmonize the use of <code>relationType</code>, e.g. be consistent with <code>Is referenced By</code> vs. <code>Is cited By</code>,</li><li>display more information rather than only links (DLM stores at least title, authors and publication date for all links),</li><li>potentially show citations for the corresponding journal article if the data were published together with the article (as in the Dryad case above) - DLM is collecting this information, and</li><li>learn from the community about the utility of a DLM service.</li></ul><p>As always with DataCite Labs projects, your feedback is greatly appreciated.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/jzg5-vcqv">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/using-yaml-frontmatter-with-csv"/>
        <updated>2015-09-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> (comma-separated values) is a popular file format for data. It is popular because it is very simple: CSV is text-based and any application that can open text files can read or write CSV. This makes it a good fit for <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml">digital preservation</a>. We don't know how many of the datasets in DataCite use CSV because the <code>format</code> metadata attribute is not used much (<a href="https://search.datacite.org/works?query=format%3Acsv">this query</a> gives you some examples), but we know that the number is big.</p><p>The CSV format has two important shortcomings: a) it is not clearly defined, and b) because of its simplicity it is almost impossible to add metadata describing the data in the CSV file. The closest thing we have to a CSV standard definition is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180">RFC 4180</a>, but that RFC clearly states that <em>It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind</em>.</p><p>If for some reason you think that the above sounds very similar to the situation with <em>markdown</em>, a simple format for text documents that <a href="http://spec.commonmark.org/0.22/">until recently</a> was not clearly defined and that provides no easy way to add metadata (such as author, title or date), then you are smarter than me, since I didn't see the connection until <a href="https://github.com/jrovegno">Javier Rovegno</a> <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/29/metadata-in-scholarly-markdown/#comment-2220461075">commented on my personal blog last week</a>. He <a href="http://jrovegno.github.io/csvy/">proposes</a> to use the <em>YAML frontmatter</em> spec for CSV files, and I think it is a brilliant idea.</p><p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">YAML frontmatter</a> is a popular way to add metadata to markdown files. <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> is a data serialization format that is very human-readable (in contrast to XML and to a lesser degree JSON). Frontmatter simply means to have the YAML section at the beginning of the document, e.g. the following, taken from the <a href="http://pandoc.org/README.html">Pandoc documentation</a>:</p><pre><code>---
title:  'This is the title: it contains a colon'
author:
- name: Author One
  affiliation: University of Somewhere
- name: Author Two
  affiliation: University of Nowhere
tags: [nothing, nothingness]
abstract: |
  This is the abstract.

  It consists of two paragraphs.
---</code></pre><p>By adding a similar section to CSV files we can add arbitrary metadata, including longer text such as a file description. In other words, all the metadata required to submit a CSV to a data repository and obtain a DOI. This makes data submission even simpler than using a zip bundle <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/reference-lists-and-tables-of-content/">as discussed in an earlier post</a>, or using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.3-6.v2">DataUp tool</a>, a Microsoft Excel add-in that is unfortunately no longer available.</p><p>Javier has picked <code>.csvy</code> as file extension for this modified file format (I like <code>.ycsv</code> a little bit better). I don't think we need to define what metadata can go into the YAML frontmatter, because there a number of different use cases. The only exception would be a standardized way to describe the columns in the CSV file, e.g.:</p><pre><code>---
columns:
  - title: Purchase Date
    type: date
  - title: Item
    type: string
  - title: Amount (€)
    type: float
---</code></pre><p>The best alternative to using CSV in combination with YAML is JSON, but that format is probably less popular than CSV for the typical data scientist (I like JSON for nested data, which would be very painful in CSV). Most people generate a separate file for CSV metadata now, risking that the data and metadata are separated.</p><p>Many tools for reading CSV files - including Microsoft Excel and the <code>read.csv</code> function in R - can ignore an arbitrary number of lines at the beginning of a CSV file, making the proposed format at least to some extend backwards-compatible. But I hope to soon see tools reading and writing YAML frontmatter in CSV files, taking full advantage of the format. In my own work I produce a lot of CSV files using R, and adding metadata to them will greatly enhance their usability. Even better if we start to see YAML frontmatter support for CSV in multiple languages, including Python, Javascript, Ruby and Julia.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/5hzj-5kds">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the first post of this new blog a few weeks ago I talked about <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-driven-development/">Data-Driven Development</a>, and that service monitoring is an important aspect of this. The main service DataCite is providing is registration of digital object identifiers (DOIs) for scholarly content, in particular research data.</p><p>Monitoring this service should include the following:</p><ol><li>number of DOIs registered</li><li>metadata associated with these DOIs</li><li>are the DOIs working as expected, e.g. are they resolving to the appropriate landing page</li><li>are these DOIs actually used, based on number of downloads, citations, etc. of the resources they are describing</li></ol><p>We can use the DataCite Search API to address #1 and #2. The <a href="http://stats.datacite.org/">DataCite Statistics Portal</a> uses the API and is an excellent starting point for #1, showing the number of DOIs registered broken down by allocator and data center.</p><p>To get more detailed information about #1, and to look into #2, we can use the statistical programming language <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rdatacite">rdatacite</a> package by Scott Chamberlain from the <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> to talk to the DataCite API. I have started to work on this and have created the public repository <a href="https://github.com/datacite/metadata-reports">metadata-reports</a> on Github for this purpose.

One of the goals of THOR is to build sustainable persistent identifier services based upon the piloting work done in ODIN.</p><p>The new DataCite Labs Search includes all functionality of the DataCite/ORCID claiming tool, but we have made some additional changes:</p><ul><li>re-deployed the service in the DataCite data center,</li><li>merged the code repository back with the original CrossRef repo, and</li><li>started work on making the service the default DataCite search.</li></ul><p><a href="http://blog.datacite.org/overcoming-development-pain/">Last week</a> I spoke a bit about the differences between how to deploy a pilot project and a production service.</p><h3 id="crosscite">Crosscite</h3><p>The DataCite/ORCID claim tool was started in 2013 as a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/CrossRef/cr-search">open source code</a> for the <a href="http://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef Metadata Search</a>. There are some subtle, but important differences between the CrossRef and DataCite Search API, and some other changes were introduced as well. Going forward we wanted to bring the two code bases together again, both for faster development and to make it easier for users: there shouldn't for example be much of a difference for a user between claiming a work to your ORCID profile from the CrossRef Metadata Search and the DataCite Labs Search. Since this month development happens in a common code repository in the <strong><strong>Crosscite</strong></strong> Github organization, and the project has been renamed to <a href="https://github.com/crosscite/doi-metadata-search">doi-metadata-search</a>. You can follow along development via Github Issues or <a href="https://waffle.io/crosscite/doi-metadata-search">this waffle.io board</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/Bildschirmfoto-2015-08-17-um-15-27-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Waffle.io" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Waffle.io</figcaption></figure><h3 id="search">Search</h3><p>Allowing users to add works with DataCite DOIs to their ORCID profile should not be done in a separate service, but is ideally part of the standard search interface to DataCite that users use anyway. We therefore have to make <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite Labs Search</a> at least as good as the current DataCite Search. Both services use the DataCite Search API as their backend, but the user interface they provide is different. Some of the differences in Labs Search include:</p><ul><li>a single search box</li><li>all information is shown in a list view, no linking to pages on data.datacite.org</li><li>citation formatter</li><li>filter results by Creative Commons license</li><li>an updated user interface</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/Bildschirmfoto-2015-08-17-um-14-05-16.png" class="kg-image" alt="DataCite Search" loading="lazy"><figcaption>DataCite Search</figcaption></figure><p>The single input field for searching should be appropriate for most queries, but Labs Search also supports <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+DisMax+Query+Parser">DisMax</a> query syntax for more complex searches, and automatically detects DOI and ORCID names. Try some more complex queries, e.g. all presentations by a particular person.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/Bildschirmfoto-2015-08-17-um-14-13-09.png" class="kg-image" alt="Citation" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Citation</figcaption></figure><p>Providing the metadata as formatted citation is an important feature that facilitates data citation. With BibTeX and RIS two standard import formats for reference managers are also supported. This feature is basically unchanged since 2013, and relies on the <a href="http://crosscite.org/">DOI content negotiation</a> API provided by several DOI registration agencies. In addition, COinS is supported, allowing the import of multiple items at once, e.g. into a reference manager.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/Bildschirmfoto-2015-08-17-um-14-22-48.png" class="kg-image" alt="COinS" loading="lazy"><figcaption>COinS</figcaption></figure><p>Allowing users to search for content based on what they are allowed to do with it is another important feature of Labs Search. We are using the <strong><strong>rightsURI</strong></strong> metadata field and the standard Creative Commons licenses. You can for example limit your search to content that uses the standard Wikipedia license <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CC_BY-SA_Compliance">CC-BY-SA</a> (see above), or you might exclude content that doesn't allow commercial reuse and/or derivative works. The <strong><strong>rightsURI</strong></strong> field allows for multiple licenses, but unfortunately less than 25% of DataCite DOI metadata include a Creative Commons license.</p><h3 id="labs">Labs</h3><p>We are launching this updated tool as a DataCite Labs service instead of replacing the production service at search.datacite.org. There are two reasons: a) there are still some rough edges and possibly bugs, and b) we need to collect broader feedback from users before this can replace the current DataCite search. We plan to do this switch in the next 1-3 months, depending on user feedback. Please comment on this blog post, open a <a href="https://github.com/crosscite/doi-metadata-search/issues">Github issue</a>, tweet about it mentioning <strong><strong>(<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>)</strong></strong>, or send an email to <strong><strong>support@datacite.org</strong></strong>.</p><p>Expect to see more new/updated DataCite services first appearing as DataCite Labs in the future.</p><h3 id="thanks">Thanks</h3><p>This is a collaborative effort and I want to thank the DataCite and THOR teams, and in particular Karl Ward, Gudmundur Thorisson, Sebastian Peters, Rob Peters, Laura Rueda, Tom Demeranville, Geoff Bilder, Laure Haak and Laura Paglione.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/s8gf-0ck9">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today DataCite received an email from a user alerting us that there are some small inconsistencies with our recommended data citation format:</p><pre><code>Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Publisher. Identifier</code></pre><p>at <a href="https://www.datacite.org/services/cite-your-data.html">https://www.datacite.org/services/cite-your-data.html</a></p><pre><code>Creator; (PublicationYear): Title; Publisher. Identifier</code></pre><p>at <a href="https://search.datacite.org/works/10.5061/DRYAD.8C1P6">search.datacite.org</a></p><p>Removing two semicolons at <strong><strong>data.datacite.org</strong></strong> looks like an easy fix, but this is a bit more complicated since the data citation at <strong><strong>data.datacite.org</strong></strong> is automatically generated using an existing citation style, which looks just slightly different (<a href="http://citationstyles.org/">http://citationstyles.org/</a> doesn't have a <strong><strong>DataCite</strong></strong> style). Support for data citation style is a topic for another blog post, but here I want to talk about what it takes to make changes to DataCite's website or services to fix a bug or add a feature.</p><p>In most cases even small changes like this one require us to deploy new code. Fixing the code in place is usually a bad idea because it makes it hard to track changes over time. When we deploy new code we have to make sure that we are really only making that small change and not changing something else in the process, e.g. because a support library is automatically updated to a newer version. So we should run tests to make sure everything is ok and we have to deploy the new code to our test system first. Before we know it this seemingly small change becomes a bigger undertaking.</p><p>The end result is of course - and this is not something limited to DataCite - that we deploy code that fixes bugs, adds new features or applies security updates far less frequently than we would like.</p><p>This is frustrating to everyone involved, and not surprisingly, many people have tried to speed up the software deployment process with concepts such as <a href="http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity">dev-prod-parity</a> (keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible) and <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration">continuous integration</a>, and tools such as <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.</p><p>For the project I am <a href="https://github.com/crosscite/doi-metadata-search">currently working on</a> I have started to add better test coverage and the continuous integration build is currently passing:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/crosscite/doi-metadata-search.svg?branch=datacite" class="kg-image" alt="Build Status" loading="lazy"></figure><p>It is a Ruby project and I can use <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">capistrano</a> to deploy a new version to the production server in about a minute.</p><h3 id="the-data-center">The data center</h3><p>The above is unfortunately a very developer-centric view. Deployment is more than pushing updated code to a server. We also need to worry about installing/updating all required software on the server and making configuration changes where needed. And we need to worry about how the server is configured in our data center in terms of access to the internet, security settings, etc. Although there is often an overlap in the tools we can use, deployment really has three aspects:</p><ol><li>code deployment</li><li>server configuration/bootstrapping</li><li>infrastructure configuration</li></ol><p>Since starting at DataCite last week, I have spent a good amount of my time working on #2 and #3. The basic assumption is that <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile">infrastructure is code</a>.</p><p>Server configurations don't change that often, so it is more important to make sure the server is configured exactly as expected rather than saving a few minutes of time. A good approach is therefore to automate the building of a virtual machine or container of the server. DataCite is using Amazon AWS for hosting, and I am using <a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> and <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a> to automatically build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the server I am working on currently. If you want to follow along (and have an AWS account and the open source Packer and Chef installed), <a href="https://github.com/crosscite/doi-metadata-search">git clone the repo</a> and issue this command:</p><pre><code>packer build template.json</code></pre><p>To add the AMI we just build to the data center; I use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a>. The beginning of the server configuration (in a private repo because security groups, etc. are also included) is:</p><pre><code>provider "aws" {
    access_key = "${var.access_key}"
    secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
    region = "${var.region}"
}

resource "atlas_artifact" "labs-search" {
    name = "datacite/doi-metadata-search"
    type = "amazon.ami"
    build = "latest"
}</code></pre><p>A <code>terraform apply</code> will build the infrastructure described by terraform. As the last step we need to run <strong><strong>capistrano</strong></strong> to deploy the latest code (not included in the AMI because the app is currently under heavy development).</p><p>To link the above workflows together we use <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/">Atlas</a>, a commercial tool, but free for the number of servers that we need to manage at DataCite. One of the nice features of Atlas is that we can trigger terraform runs by changing the terraform configuration files stored in a Github repository, so really infrastructure as code:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/Bildschirmfoto-2015-08-11-um-20-14-30.png" class="kg-image" alt="Infrastructure as code" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Infrastructure as code</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, we want to notify the team when applying these changes to the DataCite infrastructure, and we use email and Slack for this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/Bildschirmfoto-2015-08-11-um-20-20-48.png" class="kg-image" alt="Email and Slack" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Email and Slack</figcaption></figure><p>I am working on integrating <strong><strong>Docker</strong></strong> into this workflow, as Docker containers are much more flexible than Amazon Machine Images.</p><p>This post is a pretty long-winded way of saying we need to fix a typo at <strong><strong>data.datacite.org</strong></strong>, but this is of course only one of several issues on our list of <a href="https://github.com/datacite/content-resolver/issues">bugs to fix</a>.</p><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/xc6c-ef54">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I start as the new DataCite Technical Director. While I get up to speed with existing DataCite services and infrastructure, and we start to launch new services (e.g. this blog), this is also a good time to communicate the overall approach I am taking. I like to call it <strong><strong>Data-Driven Development</strong></strong>, or <strong><strong>DDD</strong></strong> as we all love acronyms.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.datacite.org/images/2015/08/Fel_048248-RE-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Blick auf Hannover (Unknown, 1931)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Blick auf Hannover (Unknown, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-driven-development/#ref-https://doi.org/10.3932/ETHZ-A-000159123">1931</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="definition">Definition</h2><p>Data-Driven Development and related terms are in use in several contexts, in particular <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/data-driven-development/">economics</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming">programming</a>. The term sounds similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">behavior-driven development</a>, two related software development processes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence">Business intelligence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data science</a> are of course closely related. My definition is as follows:</p><blockquote>We develop and maintain our services based on data.</blockquote><p>This shouldn't come as a surprise as DataCite's mission is <strong><strong>Helping you to find, access and reuse data</strong></strong>. And my last job at the Open Access publisher <a href="http://plos.org/">PLOS</a> was all about <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">collecting and presenting data</a> about the reuse of scholarly articles (citations, downloads, social media mentions, etc.). But here I mean <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> in a much broader sense.</p><h2 id="product-development">Product Development</h2><p>While the overall strategic direction is determined by the Board together with the DataCite working groups and members, we can collect data that help with decisions in product development, for example</p><ul><li>service monitoring (see below): how are our services used over time, are there any components that are particularly popular, etc.</li><li><a href="https://www.uservoice.com/">user feedback</a>: ideas, feedback, <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/ab-testing/">A/B testing</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/blog/1866-the-new-github-issues">bug reports</a></li><li><a href="http://www.discourse.org/">discussion boards</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/is">direct group messages</a>: related to the last two points, but more allowing a more open discussion</li><li>community events</li></ul><p>Compared with the next two sections, tools for data-driven product development are less commonplace (unless I missed them, in which case please provide feedback).</p><h2 id="software-development">Software Development</h2><p>The data generated during software development are increasingly made available through automated tools. We can</p><ul><li>get detailed information out of the <a href="https://github.com/datacite">version control system</a></li><li>check for passing and failing tests in <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">continuous integration servers</a></li><li>check <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">test coverage and overall code quality</a></li><li><a href="https://houndci.com/">check for consistent coding style</a></li></ul><h2 id="service-monitoring">Service Monitoring</h2><p>Any web-based service can and should be monitored for</p><ul><li><a href="https://bugsnag.com/">crashes and other serious errors</a></li><li><a href="http://newrelic.com/">server load</a>, <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">server outages</a> and <a href="https://www.nagios.org/">internal server problems</a></li><li><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">server traffic</a>, including traffic to particular pages, percentage of mobile and non-English users, etc.</li><li>specific monitoring for the services you are offering, e.g. in the case of DataCite <a href="http://stats.datacite.org/">number of DOIs registered</a> (broken down by data center), number of DOIs with specific metadata (e.g. ORCID identifiers for creators and funding information), and number of DOI resolutions (tricky because there is no easy way to filter out bots)</li><li>user-generated feedback (see section product development)</li></ul><h2 id="communication">Communication</h2><p>We don't want to stop at collecting all these data, we also need a strategy for providing them to the DataCite Board, DataCite working groups, DataCite members and data centers, DataCite staff, and everyone else who cares about these data. The default should be open, exceptions are mostly data that would raise privacy or security concerns, e.g. IP addresses in usage stats. Most of the services mentioned in this post are open for everyone to look at.</p><h2 id="synthesis">Synthesis</h2><p>Good data-driven development should not only collect lots of data and make them available, but we also need to aggregate the information in meaningful ways. Service monitoring is a good example where staff needs to understand exactly what is going on, but the typical DataCite user only cares about whether all services are running as expected. A <a href="https://status.github.com/">status dashboard</a> would be a good solution here.</p><p>The data we are generating also need to be put into the broader context. We need</p><ul><li>the DataCite Board to use them for strategic planning</li><li>to provide these data to the DataCite working groups to feed into their work (e.g. stats on what metadata are submitted by data centers for the <a href="https://www.datacite.org/tags/metadata-working-group">Metadata Working Group</a></li><li>the DataCite staff to integrate them in their work (e.g. the Communications Director utilizing the website usage stats)</li><li>these data to adapt the software development roadmap and service infrastructure</li></ul><h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2><p>Of course I am aware that this is an ambitious agenda, in particular since DataCite is a small non-profit that has limited staff and financial resources. But I don't think that data-drive development should be left to for-profit organizations and/or to organizations of a certain size. There are several things DataCite can do:</p><ul><li>implement DDD practices over time, starting with one service and one aspect</li><li>use service providers wherever it makes sense (<a href="http://thenewstack.io/new-stack-mitchell-hashimoto-containers-no-containers-one-question-2015/">there is a future where you yourself are running less servers</a>). This means anything that is not core to the DataCite mission and where the service provider is better and/or cheaper than what you could do internally. This evaluation can of course change over time</li><li>collaborate with other scholarly non-profits on infrastructure, including DataCite members and data centers, and other persistent identifier providers such as CrossRef and ORCID</li></ul><p><em>This blog post was <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/dhsm-8219">originally published</a> on the DataCite Blog.</em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Unknown.

        <updated>2015-07-29T10:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.datacite.org/news/martin-fenner-and-laura-rueda-join-datacite-team.html">Starting next week</a> I will work as the DataCite Technical Director, and I am excited about this new opportunity. But this is material for another post, here I want to reflect on the last three years working as Technical Lead for the <a href="http://lagotto.io/plos/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics</a> project.</p><p>It feels much longer than three years, but until May 2012 I worked as medical oncologist at Hannover Medical School, treating patient with cancer, attending interdisciplinary tumor boards and helping with clinical trials. It was a very brave move by PLOS to hire me at this point, especially since I <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/why-should-we-work-where-we-live">worked remotely</a> from Germany rather than in the San Francisco office. I will be forever thankful to PLOS for giving me this opportunity.</p><p>Two factors probably played a role in this decision: I have been blogging about how the internet is changing scholarly communication since 2007, and since September 2010 I had <a href="http://blogs.plos.org">my blog on the PLOS Blogs Network</a>. I had also visited the PLOS offices in San Francisco, and had met several PLOS people at conferences, including Pete Binfield, Rich Cave, Mark Patterson, Brian Mossop, Jennifer Lin and Liz Allen. I had <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">interviewed</a> Pete Binfield about PLOS ONE and the PLOS Article-Level Metrics project in August 2009, shortly after the project was launched.</p><p>The other factor was the hackathon at the 2011 Science Online London conference. We were a really small group of people (I remember Jason Hoyt, Victor Henning, Kristi Holmes and Cameron Neylon, Mendeley was hosting the event), but I had the idea to hack the open source PLOS Article-Level Metrics application. This hack turned into <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/announcing-sciencecard/">ScienceCard</a>, a version of the PLOS Article-Level Metrics application focussing on people rather than articles, and the application was a finalist for the <a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/highlighting-research/the-top-101-apps-in-the-mendeley-plos-binary-battle/">Mendeley/PLOS API Binary Battle</a>. ScienceCard doesn’t exist anymore, but the concept of organizing metrics around a person lives on in ImpactStory, facilitated by the launch of ORCID in October 2012. More importantly - without me knowing it - ScienceCard demonstrated that I could work with and extend the PLOS Article-Level Metrics code, and I think I was the first person outside of PLOS doing this. Which must have helped when PLOS was looking for a technical lead for the project a few months later.</p><p>In other words, blogging and hacking code can lead to great job opportunities.</p><p>While at PLOS I not only learned a ton of things about article-level metrics and all its challenges and opportunities, but also many basic skills needed in software development. Which is important, as my formal training is in clinical medicine and molecular biology, and doing software development in your free time (which I had done since the 1990s) only gets you so far. Some of the unexpected things I learned:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Visualizations</strong></strong>: while it was clear that I was expected to generate visualizations for the PLOS Article-Level Metrics data, I didn’t expect this to go so deep, first with R and later with <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>. Najko Jahn introduced me to using R to analyze the PLOS data, and I later worked closely with Scott Chamberlain from the <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> project to help improve their <a href="https://ropensci.org/tutorials/alm_tutorial.html">alm package</a>. The Javascript work with d3.js started with AlmViz at the 2012 ALM hackathon and later was done in close collaboration with Juan Alperin from the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">Public Knowledge Project</a>.</li><li><strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong>: the intersection of software development and system administration. I became a big fan and have spent endless hours learning how to automate the configuration and deployment of servers and other infrastructure.</li><li><strong>O<strong>pen source community building</strong></strong>: again something I was expected to do around the PLOS article-level metrics open source application, but I never expected this to be so challenging and time-consuming, but also rewarding.</li></ul><p>I thank everyone at PLOS who I had the pleasure to work with over the years, in particular Kristen Ratan, Cameron Neylon, Donna Okubo, Mei Yan Leung, Liz Allen, Catriona MacCallum, Matt Hodgkinson, Theo Bloom, Damian Pattinson, Ginny Barbour, Emma Ganley, Roli Roberts, Eric Martens, Susan Au, Matt Willman, Edgar Munoz, Rachel Drysdale, CJ Rayhill, Lisa Siegel, Jennifer Song, Polina Grinbaum, John Bertrand, Mike Baehr, Clark Hartsock, Adam Hyde, and Holly Allen. A very special thanks goes to Jennifer Lin, Rich Cave and John Chodacki who worked with me on a daily basis.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2015-07-09T10:19:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago I wrote a <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">blog post</a> about component DOIs. It is time to revisit the topic, in particular since our approach to citing data associated with a publication has changed since 2011.</p><p>Component DOIs are explained in the <a href="http://help.crossref.org/components">CrossRef Help System</a>:</p><blockquote>DOIs may be assigned to items that are part of a journal article, book chapter, or any other content item. A component would typically be a figure, table, or image which is part of or referred to by the parent item. Assigning a DOI to a component allows direct linking to the component item.</blockquote><p>Component DOIs are DOIs, i.e. persistent identifiers that link directly to the resource in question, e.g. a figure in a publication. The component DOI for a figure in a PLOS paper used in the 2011 post still <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002">works as expected</a>, despite changes to the URL of the journal landing page.</p><p>The problem with component DOIs is the problem with DOIs in general: there is basic functionality common to all DOIs, and there are additional services specific to subgroups of DOIs. This confuses users - in particular since there is no easy way to immediately see what kind of DOI they have in front of them - and in the case of component DOIs there is one important feature missing.</p><p>DOis are assigned by registration agencies (CrossRef and DataCite are the most relevant ones for scholarly content), and these RAs have built different services around DOIs, e.g. different ways to describe and search the metadata (title, authors, etc.) associated with a DOI. Component DOIs are again different, the most important difference is that in the CrossRef implementation they they are not discoverable by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv22n3.2010.06">querying the CrossRef system</a>. Component DOIs are also always associated with a parent DOI (for the article, book, etc.). Although this is the expected behavior, we shouldn’t expect component DOIs to always look like an extension of the parent DOI, as in <code>10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002</code> used in the example above.</p><p>In essence, a component DOI is a <strong><strong>DOI light</strong></strong>. We can use them for persistent linking, but we can’t use them for discovery via the CrossRef Metadata Search (and by extension other indexing services). A common use case for component DOIs is supplementary information in a journal article. Content in supplementary information files is already much harder to find than content in the body of an article, using component DOIs instead of regular DOIs makes the content again harder to find.</p><p>All of this might not have been much of an issue when I wrote the 2011 post, but making the data underlying a publication publicly available and discoverable is increasingly becoming something that funders, publishers and institutions expect. Most of these data are not deposited in dedicated data repositories, but in supplementary information files (for PLOS articles published since March 2014 this is true for more than 50% of papers). Using regular DOIs for supplementary information files with proper metadata and proper inclusion in indexing services will make it easier to find, access and reuse these data.</p><p>Unfortunately that still leaves us with the problem that the supplementary information files then will have CrossRef DOIs, whereas data repositories typically use DataCite DOIs, so that we need to search for these datasets in two different places. But that is material for another post.</p>]]></content>

Most commonly the reason is compromises we have to make when both partners have to find an adequate job. It can be a big challenge for a couple to find senior jobs in academia in the same city or region, especially outside of academic clusters such as Boston, New York or London.</p><p>The other big reason for work remote is that some research can only happen in special places, for example in high-energy physics, astronomy or the geosciences. And of course there are other flavors of the same situation, e.g. when a principal investigator moves to a new institution and PhD students or postdocs can’t or don’t want to move with him/her. And most academics have to do at least some remote work, since they will spend a good amount of time traveling to conferences or collaboration partners.</p><p>The discussion in the session centered on the social and technical challenges of working remotely. We didn’t have time to go into the legal aspects (e.g. taxes when you work in a different country), or the challenges organizing your personal life, particular difficult when you have children.</p><p>We shared our experience with online collaboration tools, and video conferencing with Skype, Google Hangouts or similar was central to this. Videoconferencing can be a challenge with slow internet connectivity, a situation that luckily is constantly improving.</p><p>Private group chat tool such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipChat">HipChat</a> or <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> are becoming increasingly popular outside the Tech sector and are a great alternative to email. They not only provide a platform for quick messages between two people, but also serve as a backchannel for informal “water cooler” discussions in an organization.</p><p>Another essential category is tools that track your work so that your remote colleagues not only can collaborate with you, but also see the work you are doing. As a supervisor you quickly see the work that was done the past week, a much more reasonable approach than looking at physical presence at work (where people might be doing all kinds of other things and personal productivity varies). Tracking your work is easy if you are a software developer like me and can look at code committed to version control, tickets closed, etc. For research this is more challenging, in particular if the workflow is not digital yet and for example all experiments are documented in a paper notebook. It seems that one requirement for remote work in science is digitalization of your work, but that is a direction we are heading anyway and which has other advantages (e.g. improving reproducibility). If there are no specialized tools for documenting your work available, then a note-taking tool such as <a href="https://www.onenote.com/">OneNote</a> or <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> can be helpful. The digitization and automation of work is obviously limited in wet labs that require direct interactions with samples and instruments.</p><p>The social aspects of remote work might be the bigger challenge. There is still a big reluctance in supervisors and administrators to this, assuming that people will only be productive if someone is watching them. This assumption is very short sighted, as what drives PhDs and postdocs to work hard is not supervision, but the intrinsic motivation to accomplish something, in particular in light of the very competitive situation for permanent jobs in academia. The book <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">Remote</a> by Jason Fried talks about this in great detail in the context of software development, but the same principles apply to work in science. What supervisors and administrators loose in direct oversight they can in attracting talent they would otherwise not get. Remote work only works if supported by the host institution, for example by adapting internal workflows and communications to make remote work the default rather than an exception.</p><p>Remote work is usually more successful and satisfying if combined with physical presence at the workplace. Reasons for this are not only the part of the work that can’t be done remotely, but more importantly the social aspect. How extensive this physical presence is depends on the circumstances. Some level of remote work has become part of almost everyone’s job in science, as it includes working at home in the evenings or on weekends, or work while traveling.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2015-06-03T10:43:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just like the rest of the internet, much of our scholarly infrastructure is built around the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), increasingly HTTPS for security, and soon <a href="https://http2.github.io/">HTTP/2</a> for better performance. In this infrastructure Universal Resource Locators (URLs) are essential to locate resources (sic) such as scholarly articles, datasets, researchers, organizations, or grants. Read <a href="http://site.thomsonreuters.com/site/data-identifiers/">this</a> recent Thomson Reuters report for a good recent perspective on this topic. While this works for the most part, there are some issues with URLs - not specific to scholarly content, but particularly import here:</p><ol><li>multiple URLs can point to the same resource</li><li>URLs can be long and look ugly</li><li>URLs can change or break, making it hard or impossible to locate the resource</li><li>we are used to central indexes (or databases) describing these resources, allowing us to do sophisticated queries not possible in a generic web search, e.g. find all publications by author John Doe, published since 2012.</li></ol><p>No. 1 is a problem relevant to all URLs, e.g. web searches or liking/commenting a particular web page. Originally suggested by Google, <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en">Canonical URLs</a> are essential for services such as Facebook or <a href="https://hypothes.is/blog/cross-format-annotation/">Hypothes.is</a>. They have been formalized in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6596">rfc6596</a> and are commonly used.</p><p>No. 2 can be a problem, in particular if we are not careful in designing appropriate URLs for landing pages (see next paragraph), but rather use something long and unreadable that also includes query parameters, etc. If we have no control over how the URL looks like, we can use URL shortener services such as <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>, which of course have become a common sight on the web. <a href="http://shortdoi.org/">ShortDOIs</a> are an URL shortener for DOIs, but they don’t seem to have gained much traction.</p><p>No. 3 is a particularly important issue, commonly referred to as <strong><strong>link rot</strong></strong> and described extensively for the scholarly literature, e.g. by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115253">Klein</a>. There are several technical solutions to this problem, a common approach is to use a landing page for the resource that will never change (and follows the recommendations by Tim Berners-Lee for <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">Cool URIs</a>, and then use redirection to point to the current location of the resource. This is easily for changes of the URL path using web server <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/remapping.html">redirect rules</a>. It gets more complicated if the server name also changes, in particular if it is the server holding the landing page. Thinking this through you realize that the only way this can be done on a larger scale is via one or more centralized services that not only provide the technical infrastructure for a central redirection (or resolver) service, but also come with a social contract of rules that everyone submitting URLs to the service has to follow - a major difference to URL shorteners, which don’t solve the link rot problem.</p><p>The above is of course a description of the DOI service provided by CrossRef, DataCite, and others, as well as similar persistent identifier services. Unfortunately some persistent identifier services don’t do the above: they create and use persistent identifiers, but there is no central resolver service that maps these identifiers back to URLs. This breaks the integration with the bigger scholarly infrastructure based on URLs. One common example are nucleotide sequences such as U65091, there is no single corresponding URL because the sequence can be found in all three main nucleotide databases: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U65091">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U65091</a>. It would help to have a central resolver, e.g. http://nucleotide.org/U65091 that then redirects to one of the three databases based on geographical location or user preference.</p><p>There are also problems with DOIs. They use the <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handle</a> system to resolve the identifier to a location, and this system was built in the 1990s as infrastructure <a href="http://www.handle.net/faq.html">independent of</a> URLs or DNS (Domain Name Service), at a time when it wasn’t clear yet that URLs and associated standards would become ubiquitous. I don’t have numbers, but practically all DOIs are of course now resolved to URLs using the <a href="http://www.doi.org/factsheets/DOIProxy.html">DOI proxy server</a> at http://doi.org (preferred) or http://dx.doi.org. One main consequence of this is that DOIs are frequently not written as URLs - e.g. doi:10.5555/24242424x instead of <a href="https://doi.org/10.5555/24242424x">https://doi.org/10.5555/24242424x</a> - again breaking the integration with the bigger scholarly infrastructure. The CrossRef <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/doi_display_guidelines.html">DOI display guidelines</a> clearly state that DOIs should be written as URLs in <em>the online environment</em>, which basically is whenever DOIs are used, as PDFs and even Word documents know how to handle URLs. Unfortunately this guideline is still frequently ignored. The above is of course also true for other persistent identifiers using the Handle system, e.g. <a href="http://www.pidconsortium.eu/">ePIC</a>.</p><p>The other problem with the DOI system is that it doesn’t address issue No. 4, i.e. provide a central metadata index for the resources that use the system. This job is left to the DOI registration agencies such as CrossRef and DataCite, who have implemented a central metadata store (e.g. <a href="https://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> or <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>) in different ways (e.g. using different metadata schemata), or not at all. This means that we have to look in several places to find all DOIs associated with author John Doe, published since 2012. Obviously we are used to looking up information in multiple places, but not being able to look up the metadata for a DOI without some extra work (finding out the registration agency for the DOI and then going to the respective metadata store) is a problem. One way around these problems is to use the <a href="https://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html">DOI Content Negotiation Service</a>.</p><p>Another problem with the DOI system is more a social than a technical issue. Neither CrossRef nor DataCite seem to enforce that DOIs should always resolve to URLs when using a computer program. DOI resolution for humans works fine, but computers, e.g. command line tools such as cURL, can run into issues such as requiring cookies, javascript or user input, or permission problems getting to the journal landing page (see <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/challenges-in-automated-doi-resolution">this earlier blog post</a> for some numbers). People seem to forget that a DOI that is not actionable is not really useful, and that scholarly infrastructure is not only used by people, but of course also by automated tools.</p><p>The persistent identifiers used in our scholarly infrastructure would benefit from a clearer focus on the problems they should solve, starting with No. 1-4 above. One problem is that we probably focus too much on the persistence problem, implied also by the term <strong><strong>persistent identifier</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>PID</strong></strong>. What we have neglected is the resolvable problem, i.e. making as easy as possible to get from the persistent identifier to the resource and/or its metadata. Based on the Den Haag Manifesto and suggested by Todd Vision, we therefore proposed the term <strong><strong>trusted identifier</strong></strong> with the following characteristics in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.824314">conceptual model of interoperability</a> for the <a href="http://odin-project.eu/">ODIN Project</a>:</p><ul><li>are unique on a global scale, allowing large numbers of unique identifiers</li><li>resolve as HTTP URI’s with support for content negotiation, and these HTTP URI’s should be persistent.</li><li>come with metadata that describe their most relevant properties, including a minimum set of common metadata elements. A search of metadata elements across all trusted identifiers of that service should be possible.</li><li>are interoperable with other identifiers through metadata elements that describe their relationship.</li><li>are issued and managed by an organization that focuses on that goal as its primary mission, has a sustainable business model and a critical mass of member organizations that have agreed to common procedures and policies, has a governing body, and is committed to using open technologies.</li></ul><p>While not directly relevant for resolving persistent identifiers as URLs, the last point is really important for any persistent identifier infrastructure, <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314859">described in detail recently</a>.</p><p>If I would design a persistent identifier service today (as if we would need yet another persistent identifier service), I would build the system around an URL shortening service that I control. The URLs could look very similar to what we have with DOIs now, e.g. <a href="http://doi.org/10.5555/12345678">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678</a>, but it would be clear that persistent identifiers are URLs, not something separate. Plus we could take advantage of all the lessons learned - and possibly even reuse open source code - with URL shorteners, which are much more widely used than scholarly persistent identifiers.</p><p><em>Update 6/4/15: added link to Thomson Reuters <a href="http://site.thomsonreuters.com/site/data-identifiers/">report</a> on identifiers and open data.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Julie McMurry and co-authors <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18003">published a preprint</a> <strong><strong>10 Simple rules for design, provision, and reuse of persistent identifiers for life science data</strong></strong>. This is an important paper trying to address a fundamental problem: how can we make persistent identifiers both human-readable and machine-readable?</p><p>Don’t be fooled by the title (used frequently by <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/ten-simple-rules/">PLOS Computational Biology</a>) - the paper doesn’t describe simple rules that help the average life sciences researcher. Rather, the paper deals with rather complex issues, and has 36 authors.</p><p>There is general agreement that we need persistent identifiers for scholarly communication, and that also includes life sciences datasets, the focus of the paper. What is less clear is how to express these persistent identifiers. An identifier such as <strong><strong>AB020317</strong></strong> - for the mouse p53 gene - is ambiguous. It is not clear without additional information that this is an identifier for the GenBank nucleotide database, rather than <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexcycu/8936663973/">something completely different</a>. One common approach to make this identifier unambiguous is to use URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), e.g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB020317">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB020317</a> in this case.</p><p>The paper doesn’t like this approach, and even states that “URIs are still among the most commonly used and most problematic identifiers in the bio-data ecosystem”. The text also states that “their length makes them unwieldy for humans working with the data or for referencing in publications or other text”, but doesn’t go into any detail why URIs are “problematic identifiers”, or why length is an issue in an online environment.</p><p>This is an important weakness of the paper, because the authors propose an alternative: CURIEs or <strong><strong>compact URIs</strong></strong>. CURIEs were <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/">proposed</a> by the W3C a few years ago, as a way to make URIs <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/curies-a-cure-for-uris/">more human-readable</a>. The idea is simple, we use a namespace in addition to the local identifier, separated by a colon, e.g. <strong><strong><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AB020317">Genbank:AB020317</a></strong></strong>.</p><p>This approach has of course been common practice in the life sciences before CURIEs or even the WWW existed, and is still the most common approach how identifiers for life sciences data are referenced in the scholarly literature. Unfortunately there are important problems with CURIEs, most of them mentioned in the paper:</p><ul><li>Persistent identifiers need to be resolvable, without additional information we don’t know what to do with <strong><strong><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AB020317">Genbank:AB020317</a></strong></strong>. Most life sciences researchers understand this CURIE, but that might not necessarily be true for less commonly used namespaces</li><li>Namespaces are not necessarily unique, the paper uses <strong><strong>GEO</strong></strong> (which could mean Gene Expression Omnibus or GeoNames Ontology) as an example</li><li>Rule 3 in the paper goes into great detail what characters and patterns should be avoided in local identifiers that are part of a CURIE. It is not clear whether these recommendations will always be followed or how to check them</li><li>CURIEs should follow a pattern (regular expression) so that they can be extracted from a text. We <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063184">know</a> that extracting identifiers from journal articles is possible, but difficult.</li></ul><p>URIs don’t have the problems listed above: they resolve, are unique, and there is good understanding (and available tools) of how a valid URI should look like and how to extract URIs from text documents. That is why URIs are good representations of persistent identifiers.</p><p>Another problem I have with CURIEs: the idea doesn’t seem to have caught on from the initial work more than five years ago (background reading <a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2011/case-for-curies/">here</a>). I’m not even sure what percentage of persistent identifier experts know about CURIEs.</p><p>My recommendation for life sciences data: express persistent identifiers as URIs. Now that can go into 10 simple rules for the average life sciences researcher.</p><p><em>P.S. This blog uses a tool <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">I wrote two years ago</a> that automatically turns CURIEs in the text into links.</em></p>]]></content>

        <id>60492188933ce91212866ffa</id>
        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/introducing-the-scholarly-markdown-bundle"/>
        <updated>2015-04-23T11:48:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Using Markdown to author scholarly documents is an attractive alternative to the standard authoring tools Microsoft Word and LaTeX. The feeling shared by many is that <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">Scholarly Markdown</a> is 80% there, and that more effort is needed for the remaining 20% - moving markdown from a niche into the mainstream. What is mainly needed is building tools that connect the existing tools and ideas, resulting in one or more services attractive to a critical number of users. But maybe we also need to rethink the essential parts of Scholarly Markdown. In this post I propose that we expand the concept and define the <em>Scholarly Markdown Bundle</em>.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that scholarly work can’t be adequately described in a single text document, most commonly the journal article. Not only are there associated metadata, assets such as figures and supplementary information, but also the research data and software needed to produce the work described in the publication. The obvious next step is to think of scholarly work as a collection of objects, most clearly described by Carol Goble and others as <a href="https://researchobject.github.io/specifications/bundle/">Research Object Bundle</a>.</p><p>There will probably never be a single authoring tool and format that pleases everyone. Markdown has particular inherent strengths and weaknesses, complex math or tables will probably always be easier with other formats. The strength of markdown is the simplicity of the format. Some things are hard or impossible to do, but many other things are much simpler. Creating a useful markdown editor is much easier than a word processor reading/writing <code>docx</code> format. Markdown is also a perfect format to <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/using-microsoft-word-with-git/">work with</a> version control systems such as git.</p><p>This low barrier of entry makes markdown perfect to be integrated into many workflows. And we can go one step further than ePub and Research Object Bundle, which use the related Universal Container Format (<a href="https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/Universal+Container+Format">UCF</a>) and ePub Open Container Format (<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-ocf.html">OCF</a>), respectively. Instead of using zip to compress a folder into a single file we can use git version control instead: git provides the commands <code>git bundle</code> and <code>git archive</code> to compress a project under version control with or without version history. I feel this format is both more powerful So I propose the <em>Scholarly Markdown Bundle</em>:</p><ul><li>a git repository with one or more markdown files, either as a folder, or compressed into a single file using <code>git bundle</code></li><li>a particular flavor or markdown called Scholarly Markdown, and discussed here and elsewhere before</li><li>a <code>citeproc.json</code> file in the root of the project that contains all metadata relevant to the container, including references</li></ul><p>The <code>citeproc.json</code> file is similar to the minimal metadata schema <a href="https://github.com/mbjones/codemeta">codemeta</a> proposed by Matt Jones and others, but is in the format used by Pandoc today. This is <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/citeproc-yaml-for-bibliographies/">important</a> because it adds citation parsing support out of the box. The last two points rely on the <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> document conversion tool, so Scholarly Markdown bundles are really <strong><strong>markdown</strong></strong> + <strong><strong>Pandoc</strong></strong> + <strong><strong>Citeproc/CSL</strong></strong> + <strong><strong>git</strong></strong>. The format is flexible enough to not only describe scholarly articles, but also other kinds of scholarly works, including scientific software managed with git version control. And it integrates nicely with a number of existing workflows, e.g. an R project using RStudio for both code and text (in Rmarkdown). This format should also work for blogs like this one, but I would have to separate the blog posts from the Jekyll site generator code, a direction I suggested in the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/blogging-beyond-jekyll/">last</a> post.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2015-03-23T11:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog has been on four different platforms since starting in 2007: a custom blogging engine and then <a href="https://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> on <a href="http://network.nature.com/">Nature Network</a> 2007-2010, Wordpress on the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org">PLOS Blogs Network</a> 2010-2013, and the static blogging engine <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> hosted on Github Pages since 2013. It might be time for yet another blogging platform change.</p><p>The main reason to switch from Wordpress to Jekyll was the concept of a static site generator: write posts in <a href="http://commonmark.org/">markdown format</a>, store them in a Github repository, and then have Jekyll automatically generate the HTML pages hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The main attraction was the blog posts in markdown format stored in git version control without the need of a database. Jekyll is the glue to make all this work, and I was able to customize Jekyll to my needs, e.g. by using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> for the markdown to html conversion.</p><p>While this workflow still makes sense for this blog, there are a number of shortcomings:</p><ul><li>Jekyll needs to rebuild the entire site every time I publish a new post. While this isn’t much of a problem for the size of this blog, it doesn’t scale well for larger sites. And the process is more complex if you use custom jekyll plugins like this blog, as you can’t use the automatic Jekyll pipeline provided by Github (hint: use a Travis continuous integration server <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/continuous-publishing/">to build the site</a>)</li><li>the web is moving to increasingly sophisticated javascript frontends, using frameworks such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, or frontend libraries for scholarly documents such as <a href="http://elifesciences.org/elife-news/lens">Lens</a>. While they can be used together with Jekyll, that is not a typical use case.</li><li>the tight integration between the code to generate the website and the content (Wordpress and other blogging engines have the same approach) is not always the best solution, e.g. when you want to want to generate the pages for something that is not a blog (e.g. a <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/">book</a>).</li></ul><p>What could we do instead?</p><blockquote>Build a Javascript frontend where the content is served via an API built around markdown documents, stored in git version control.</blockquote><h3 id="api">API</h3><p>The blog posts are still written in markdown, stored (and version-controlled in a Github repository), but we would now access the content via API. The easiest solution is to use the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/">Github Contents API</a> and either do the markdown to html conversion in javascript yourself, or let the Github API do the conversion to HTML for you. Alternatively we could build our own API, e.g. because we want to control the markdown to html conversion, or need additional functionality such as fulltext search. And of course the two approaches can be combined, e.g. via a Github webhook that triggers the markdown to html conversion every time a document is added or updated, and stores the converted documents in the same repo.</p><h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3><p>The frontend should be written as a one-page javascript application, not requiring a server backend. In contrast to the Jekyll workflow the frontend code doesn’t need to be updated every time we post a blog post. Since this is a very common scenario, there are probably several solutions out there already. Please mention them in the comments if you have suggestions. One candidate is <a href="https://github.com/elifesciences/lens/">Lens</a> mentioned above - a beautiful frontend for scholarly documents. Lens displays documents in the <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/index.html">JATS</a> XML format, so your API would have to provide that format.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>The separation into API and frontend is of course old news. But for blogs this seems to still be a fairly new concept, in particular when combined with a backend using documents stored in git version control rather than in a database. Wordpress added a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/">REST API Plugin</a> in 2014, and the Ghost blogging framework (which uses a database backend) also seems to <a href="https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap">go into that general direction</a>. Please ping me if you like the idea and want to contribute, or have implemented something like this already.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2015-03-20T11:52:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Metadata such as author, title, journal or persistent identifier are essential for scholarly documents, and some of us are spending a significant part of our time adding or fixing metadata. Unfortunately we sometimes don’t pay enough attention to the flow of metadata, i.e. we ignore already existing metadata, or reinvent the wheel in how we describe or store them.</p><p>Storing metadata in text-based formats is usually straightforward. This blog post is written in markdown with a <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML header</a> - think of YAML as the more human-readable version of JSON - at the beginning of the document:</p><pre><code>---
title: Metadata in Microsoft Word documents
---</code></pre><p>This is then translated into this HTML when the blog post is published:</p><pre><code>&lt;meta property="dc:title" content="Metadata in Microsoft Word documents" /&gt;</code></pre><p>XML is of course a very natural format for metadata, here for example <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/index.html">JATS</a> used for scholarly articles:</p><pre><code>&lt;article-title&gt;Metadata in Microsoft Word documents&lt;/article-title&gt;</code></pre><p>Many scholarly documents start out as Microsoft Word documents. And while the <code>docx</code> format introduced by Microsoft in Microsoft Office 2007 <a href="http://officeopenxml.com/">is XML-based</a>, few users are aware of this fact. And probably even fewer users (including myself) ever go to the <code>Properties…</code> settings of a <code>docx</code> document and add a <code>title</code>, <code>keywords</code> or other metadata (the <code>author</code> is usually set automatically).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/IC164149.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="419" height="488"><figcaption>Microsoft Word 2007 Properties. Image from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308936(v=office.12).aspx">Microsoft Developer Network</a></figcaption></figure><p>This is very unfortunate, as these metadata are very often required, e.g. in a journal article submission, and then need to be collected again, usually either by asking the author to fill out a web form, and/or by extracting the metadata (e.g. title) from the document.</p><p>The best place for metadata is with the document (not <em>in</em> the document), and if the file format (<code>docx</code> in this case) supports it, we should take advantage of this. The main benefit: metadata stay with the text when the document is sent to co-authors via email, or put on a file server, or into Dropbox.</p><p>In the case of <code>docx</code>, the metadata support is actually pretty good, using the standard <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>, and storing the metadata in a separate file called <code>core.xml</code>. You can see this file if you unzip your <code>docx</code> file (e.g. after giving it a <code>zip</code> extension). The <code>core.xml</code> file for this blog post (after converting the markdown file to <code>docx</code> using <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>) looks like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;cp:coreProperties xmlns:cp="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core-properties" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:dcmitype="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"&gt;&lt;dc:title&gt;Metadata in Microsoft Word documents&lt;/dc:title&gt;&lt;dc:creator&gt;&lt;/dc:creator&gt;&lt;/cp:coreProperties&gt;</code></pre><p>Because <code>docx</code> is XML, we can read/write this file not only in Microsoft Word, e.g. using macros, but also outside of Microsoft Word, e.g. in workflows that converts <code>docx</code> documents into other formats, or tools that check <code>docx</code> files for required metadata (e.g. by using <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/introducing-rakali/">rakali</a> that I wrote last year). So please encourage authors to use the Microsoft Word <code>Properties…</code> settings, and update existing tools to take advantage of the Dublin Core metadata stored in every <code>docx</code> file.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/metrics-for-scientific-software/">I wrote about</a> software.lagotto.io, an instance of the <a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto">lagotto</a> open source software collecting metrics for the about 1,400 software repositories included in Sciencetoolbox. In this post I want to report the first results analyzing the data.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/software.lagotto.io_2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1444" height="722"><figcaption>Number of software repositories (out of 1,404) with at least one event.

A special thanks goes to <a href="http://scottchamberlain.info/">Scott Chamberlain</a> who greatly helped me by tweaking the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/alm">alm</a> R package to support URLs instead of DOIs as identifiers.</p><p>The first step in the analysis is to get an overview of the external sources citing or discussing the software package:</p><p>This is basically the same figure as in the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/metrics-for-scientific-software/">previous post</a>, but with two differences: I have added a <a href="http://www.nature.com/opensearch/">Nature.com OpenSearch</a> data source, and I have found an additional 64 repositories cited in scholarly articles via an Europe PMC full-text Search that also includes the reference lists (thanks to <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/johanna-mcentyre">Jo McEntyre</a>).</p><p>I am not sure why we are not picking up any Wikipedia citations, and have to take a closer look. The ORCID source also needs tweaking, and there are some issues with the <a href="http://wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Wordpress.com</a> data that I have to look into as well. Citations in the scholarly literature are obviously the most interesting data, and we have three Github repos with more than 25 citations, including <a href="https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">https://github.com/najoshi/sickle</a> with 54 citations. As most repositories in our sample are cited only once if at all, a correlation with Github stars and forks is not useful. Sickle is popular on Github (52 stars and 32 forks), but it is not clear that this activity is correlated to citations (e.g. because there are more citations than stars).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/github_likes_readers-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="672" height="480"><figcaption>Correlation between Github stargazers and forks, log-log scale. Data from <a href="http://software.lagotto.io">software.lagotto.io</a></figcaption></figure><p>The vast majority of software repos in this analysis are hosted by Github, so we have the numbers of stars and forks for those. It is interesting, although probably not very surprising, that the number of Github stargazers and forks is highly correlated:</p><p>We can find Facebook activity (likes, comments or shares) for one third of the repositories. There is a reasonably good correlation between Facebook activity and number of Github forks:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/facebook_github_readers-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="672" height="480"><figcaption>Correlation between combined Facebook activity and Github forks, log-log scale. Data from <a href="http://software.lagotto.io">software.lagotto.io</a></figcaption></figure><p>One interesting analysis would be to look at the repositories that have been forked much more often relative to their Facebook activity, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/impala">Impala</a> with 1,207 Github stars and 458 forks, but only 5 Facebook shares. One limitation of the analysis is that we are not tracking Facebook (or other social media) activity for all forks of a repo.</p><p>We found Reddit discussions mentioning one of the repositories in 7% of cases. Once we have a larger sample size it would be interesting to correlate this activity with Github stars and forks, similar to what we did for Facebook. By far the most popular repository from our sample on Reddit is <a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, followed by <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery">JQuery</a>. Twitter activity is notoriously difficult to collect since Twitter doesn’t keep tweets very long, hence probably the low numbers compared to Facebook and Reddit.</p><p>Feel free to play with the data and scripts provided at <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/software-analysis">https://github.com/mfenner/software-analysis</a>, my next step is probably to include a much larger number of software repositories.</p><p>It has not escaped our notice that the kind of analysis described above could be applied to any software repository, not just scientific software.</p>]]></content>

While there is an increasing number of journal articles freely available via green or gold open access, the majority of them still can only be read if the reader works at an institution with a subscription to the journal. Many journals also allow the reader to buy a single article of interest, for prices between $10 and more than $30:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/pay_per_view_lancet.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="606" height="554"><figcaption>For an article in Lancet</figcaption></figure><p>There is also a document delivery service provided by libraries, but that option varies considerably by country and in Germany for example means a scanned article as printout rather than the original PDF because of a change in German copyright law a few years ago. There are also the services <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/">DeepDyve</a> and <a href="https://www.readcube.com/">ReadCube</a>, but again you don’t get the PDF (or only for prices similar to those quoted above), but rather limited access for reading and printing.</p><p>In summary, affordable access to scholarly content by subscription publishers is in a dire state: you either have to work at an academic institution subscribing to the desired journal, get only a crippled version of the article (online viewing only), or pay up to $30 for a single article, which clearly doesn’t scale beyond very occasional use.</p><p>With this background it is obvious that several people have discussed the iTunes Store-like model to sell scholarly articles:</p><ul><li><a href="http://crosstech.crossref.org/2009/09/prc_report_and_ipub_revisited.html">PRC Report and “iPub” revisited</a></li><li><a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2009-10/deepdyve-launches-itunes-science-papers">DeepDyve launches iTunes Store-like service for science papers</a></li><li><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2012/01/10/could-an-itunes-like-model-wor/">Could an iTunes-like model work with scientific publishing?</a></li><li><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/10/07/start-readcube-program-uses-itunes-payment-model-for-access-scientific-articles/1UopCX1qfEE3uO2UEzuM7L/story.html">A plan to open up science journals</a></li><li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/when-the-rebel-alliance-sells-out">When the Rebel Alliance Sells Out</a></li></ul><p>The best already existing platforms to build such as service are reference managers, as most of them have learned now to manage PDF files, and have an online component. ReadCube is offering a pay-per-view option already, Papers, Mendeley, Endnote or others could get into this business.</p><p>One of the big advantages of payments for single articles is transparency, as institutions and users only pay for what they actually use. Price transparency is one of the big problems with the <em>big deal</em> contracts that academic institutions have with publishers - read <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1403006111">this article</a> for more info.</p><p>But rather than becoming the predominant way to pay for digital music, services such as DeepDyve and ReadCube are only playing a marginal role. Why is that so?</p><ul><li>whereas digital music is paid for by the consumer, there is usually a middleman in the form of the library for scholarly articles, which makes the payment process more complex.</li><li>subscription publishers have focused all their efforts on selling big deals with increasing numbers of journals to libraries. Prices of $30 per article are clearly intended to discourage payment for single articles (which could jeopardize journal bundles) rather than offering an earnest payment option.</li><li>Apple was in a strong negotiation position with record labels when starting the iTunes store (the extremely popular iPod, record labels scared of file-sharing platforms such as Napster). No organization is in a similar position with scientific publishers, and services such as ReadCube or Mendeley are handicapped because they are associated with a particular publisher</li></ul><p>Unless several large publishers and/or a smart third-party with enough muscle start an initiative in this space, e.g. by bringing the pay-per-view prices to a reasonable level (e.g. $4.99), we will never see an iTunes Store-like service for scholarly articles, and this currently looks like the most likely outcome. We may have reached the point where it is too late, as most publishers seem to already work towards another payment model: gold open access where the authors pay the article costs.</p><p><em>Update 3/2/15: added link to 2009 CrossTech blog post.</em></p>]]></content>

        <updated>2015-02-19T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges of collecting metrics for scholarly outputs is persistent identifiers. For journal articles the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) has become the de-facto standard, other popular identifiers are the pmid from PubMed, the identifiers used by Scopus and Web of Science, and the arxiv ID for ArXiV preprints.</p><p>For other research outputs the picture is less clear. DOIs are also used for datasets, but so are many other identifiers, in particular in the life sciences.</p><p>To collect metrics for research outputs, the requirements are slightly different. We need identifiers understood by the services collecting the metrics, not by the data repository or other service that is holding the research output (the only exception is usage stats, which are generated locally). For many services, in particular social media such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit, the primary identifier for a resource is a URL. This means that we should have one or more URLs for every research output where we want to track the metrics - typically the publisher or data repository landing page. Since URLs can be messy, Google, Facebook and others have come up with the concept of a <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.de/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html">canonical URL</a>, and some care should go into constructing proper canonical URLs (see <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/challenges-in-automated-doi-resolution">this blog post</a> for examples of what can go wrong).</p><p>The Den Haag Manifesto is the result of a <strong><strong>Knowledge Exchange</strong></strong> workshop held in June 2011 and tries to bring Persistent Identifiers and Linked Open Data together. The first principle is very much in line with what I said above:</p><blockquote>Make sure PIDs can be referred to as HTTP URI’s, including support for content negotiation.</blockquote><p>Or, to put this differently: URLs are good enough to start collecting metrics for scholarly outputs. Scientific software is a good example where persistent identifiers are not commonly used (despite efforts such as <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">this one</a>), but we can still collect many meaningful metrics using the repository URL (and the open source software <a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto">lagotto</a>):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/software.lagotto.io.png" class="kg-image" alt="Number of software repositories (out of 1,404) with at least one event. Data from software.lagotto.io" loading="lazy" width="1468" height="686"><figcaption>Number of software repositories (out of 1,404) with at least one event. Data from software.lagotto.io</figcaption></figure><p>The last three rows are citations in the scholarly literature found via fulltext search of BioMed Central, Europe PMC and PLOS. URLs (in contrast to persistent identifiers represented as strings and/or numbers) are easy to find, the main limitation is not so much using a URL rather than a DOI, but that scientific software typically is mentioned in the text without appearing in the reference list. This makes it hard to impossible to find articles mentioning the software that are not open access, which unfortunately is still the majority of them.</p><p>We are of course also tracking the discussion of the software in social media, and are collecting the number of stars and forks in Github and Bitbucket. Overall there is quite a lot of activity, here are some examples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">Windowed Adaptive Trimming for fastq files using quality</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/lh3/wgsim">Reads simulator</a></li><li><a href="http://software.lagotto.io/works/url/https://github.com/lh3/seqtk">Toolkit for processing sequences in FASTA/Q formats</a></li></ul><p>All three software repos have been cited in the scholarly literature at least ten times. What is missing is infrastructure that tracks the citations of scientific software, so that we can give proper scientific credit to the authors of the software, and can discover other research projects using the same tools. software.lagotto.io uses a list of software repos collected by Jure Triglav for ScienceToolbox, and a scientific software index is indeed one of the important missing pieces.</p>]]></content>

The report of that workshop isn’t done yet, but I can say that it was a success - we now have a pretty good idea what the problems are and what needs to be done to fix them. The short summary of the workshop is in <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mfenner/workshop-summary-reference-managers-and-data-citation">this</a> slide deck of the presentation that summarized the workshop for the other Force15 attendees.</p><p>The whole idea of the workshop was to treat data citation as similar as possible to the citation of journal articles, i.e. to allow authors to use the same tools (reference managers) and conventions (citation styles). Putting a data citation into a reference list makes it easier to find that data citation because reference lists contain more metadata, are more structured, and more accessible than data citations in the form of identifiers or links within the body text of the article.</p><p>But I have to admit that there is one problem with reference lists: although there is always some self-citation, reference lists usually contain references to articles (and other resources) created by other people and before the article was published. It feels a little bit odd to put a dataset created by the same group of people and published at the same time into the reference list. And although we could use a separate reference list or highlight the data associated with the article in some other way, what we really want is something slightly different, a manifest file.</p><p>The journal article has been a (mainly) textual document for many centuries not because this is the essence of science communication, but rather because there was no practical way to include all the other information (raw data, tools used for experiments, etc.). Very few of these limitations remain with the digital journal article that we have since the 1990s, but we have for the most part failed to change the format other than going from paper to PDF. One of many examples: figures in publications typically still are has limited as they were decades ago with no way to see the data underlying the figure, options for selecting what data points are shown, or animation for time-based information.</p><p>So what we really care about is the sum of artifacts and resources that together make what Carol Goble and others call <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2010.4626.1">research object</a>, the journal article is an important part, but clearly doesn’t include everything that is needed to understand and reproduce the work. Reference lists can help with linking to some of the resources not included in the article text, but they typically don’t link to supplementary information or other places where the underlying data are made available, or to the figures of the article. Although some publishers provide navigation tools for readers to get to this information, what we really need is a machine-readable list of all the resources used in an article.</p><p>As it happens, this is exactly what the ePub format for electronic books is doing, as every ePub must include a manifest file that lists all the files that are part of the publication, defined in the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm">Open Packaging Format (OPF)</a>. I need to do more research to figure out how to do this with <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/index.html">JATS</a>, the standard for scholarly articles, and how to generate something similar to the manifest file when using different formats, e.g. html or markdown. This has to be linked to some of the information we are collecting already, e.g. described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0014.106">JATS</a>, or the <code>relatedIdentifier</code> in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/0010">DataCite metadata</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the title of an upcoming workshop next Sunday organized by Ian Mulvany and myself. The workshop is a <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/pre-conference-meeting-list">pre-conference event</a> of the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015">Force15</a> conference in Oxford. This blog post summarizes some of the issues and work that needs to be done.</p><p>Data Citation is one of the big themes of the Force15 conference, and a lot of progress has been made, including the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (Data Citation Synthesis Group 2014) that start with the following paragraph on <strong><strong>Importance</strong></strong>:</p><blockquote>Data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research. Data citations should be accorded the same importance in the scholarly record as citations of other research objects, such as publications.</blockquote><p>Convincing researchers, funders, university administrators and others that data citation is important is crucial. But for researchers to actually adopt data citation to the same degree as citations of the scholarly literature, more needs to be done:</p><ul><li>incentives (both carrots and sticks) by funders, institutions, and scholarly societies</li><li>training in data management</li><li>data repositories and other tools and services for the public sharing of data</li><li>tools and services that help citing those datasets</li></ul><p>The focus of the workshop is on the last bullet point, and I would argue that more work still needs to be done here compared to the first three bullet points.</p><h2 id="reference-managers">Reference Managers</h2><p>Researchers use reference managers to handle the citations in the manuscripts they write. This is both a common practice that everybody understands, and there are a plethora of tools - both free and paid - available. Most reference managers were originally built to handle citations of journal articles and maybe books or book chapters, and many of them also help with managing the associated PDF files. In the last 15 years we have seen an dramatic increase of non-article citations in reference lists, mainly to web resources (Klein et al., 2014):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/journal.pone.0115253.g002.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2785" height="2595"><figcaption>From Fig. 2: STM articles and URI references per publication year - Elsevier corpus (Klein et al. 2014)</figcaption></figure><p>References managers have started to adapt to these changes in citation patterns. Similarly they have become better in handling non-textual resources such as slide decks, datasets, or movies. Nobody should type in references by hand in 2015, as reference managers have come up with several ways of importing metadata about citations:</p><ul><li>import references stored in a file using a format such as BibTex or RIS</li><li>import references by talking to an external API</li><li>import references via a bookmarklet that grabs information from the current webpage in the browser</li></ul><p>Endnote and Papers typically use the second approach whereas Mendeley, Zotero (and others) work almost exclusively via bookmarklets (and there are of course combinations of both). Bookmarklets in general work better for web resources and other content that is not indexed in a central service such as Web of Science or Scopus. This is also true for research data, as there are currently few central research data indexing services - the Thomson Reuters <a href="http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/">Data Citation Index</a> and <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> are two examples in this category. But there are also thousands of data repositories, many of them listed in re3data (Pampel et al., 2013).</p><p>The reference manager <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> has built a large open source ecosystem around bookmarklets (what they call <a href="https://github.com/zotero/translators">web translators</a>), making it straightforward to add support for a new resource, as I have done for <a href="https://github.com/zotero/translators/blob/master/NCBI%20Nucleotide.js">GenBank nucleotide sequence datasets</a> in November after learning the basics in a <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/webinar-on-writing-zotero-translators/">webinar</a> given by Sebastian Karcher, a frequent contributor to Zotero web translators.</p><p>There is no technical reason that reference managers can’t support a broad range of objects to cite, including datasets. And integration of data citation into the reference manager workflow is not only the easiest and most natural way for the author of a paper, but also makes it easier to discover these citations - reference lists are simply much better for that than links in the text, in particular if the content is behind subscription walls. There is a long tradition in the life sciences to put identifiers for genetic sequences used in a publication right into the text (usually into the methods section). Links in the body text are worse than references in reference lists, <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">identifiers without a link</a> are even worse, as they are very hard to find in an automated way (Kafkas, Kim, &amp; McEntyre, 2013).</p><p>Please come to our workshop on Sunday afternoon if you are in Oxford and are interested in this topic. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-citation-support-in-reference-managers-tickets-15136593960">Registration</a> is free, and the workshop will include both presentations about the current state of data citation support in the reference managers Endnote, Papers, Mendeley and Zotero, and work in smaller groups on practical implementations.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Kafkas, Ş., Kim, J.-H., &amp; McEntyre, J.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/please-keep-it-simple-citations-links-and-references/">blog post two weeks ago</a> I argued for the need for reference managers to properly support data citation, if we want data citation to become a standard activity. I am happy to announce two events working towards that goal.</p><h2 id="november-3rd-webinar-on-writing-zotero-web-translators">November 3rd: Webinar on writing Zotero web translators</h2><p><a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/community-spotlight-sebastian-karcher/">Sebastian Karcher</a>, one of the most prolific authors of Zotero web translators (and citation styles), has kindly offered to hold an introductory webinar on writing Zotero web translators. These web translators allow Zotero to import metadata about a scholarly work from a variety of places, and new web translators for repositories that hold research data (or software) would go a long way towards making data citation easier for authors. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/translators">Web translators</a> are written in Javascript and only basic Javascript knowledge is required. The free webinar takes place on November 3rd on 5 PM UK time (12 PM EST) and the registration form is <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/writing-zotero-translators-webinar-tickets-13768797845">here</a>.</p><h2 id="january-11-force11-pre-conference-workshop-on-data-citation-support-in-reference-managers">January 11: Force11 Pre-Conference workshop on Data Citation Support in Reference Managers</h2><p><a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/pre-conference-meeting-list">This workshop</a>, co-organized with Ian Mulvany, will extend the Zotero web translator work to other reference managers, including Papers and Mendeley. This will be a hackathon with the goal to get some things working in these reference managers, but it should also be interesting for others, as we will discuss what is missing to make data citation work in reference managers.</p><p>My personal goal is to learn to write a Zotero web translator in the webinar, and then write a working web translator for the three biological databases ENA, PDB and Uniprot before the January workshop. And hopefully these activities generate enough interest that other people write web translators for their favorite research data database or software repository, and that the proprietary reference managers Papers and Mendeley (and hopefully others) also add support for these data sources.</p>]]></content>

I am helping organize this conference since 2009, and I again look forward to the sessions, and - more importantly - the discussions with people in and between sessions this year.</p><p>The name (ScienceBlogging London, ScienceOnline London, SpotOn London), the location (Royal Institution, British Library, Wellcome Conference Center), the people organizing (too many to mention, but Nature Publishing Group always at the core), and the fringe events (lots of cool things from <a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-life/science-blogging-2008-part-i/">science tours</a> to <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-fringe-event-the-story-collider-2/">Story Collider</a>) and the format have always changed slightly over the years, and this year again is a bit different. The biggest change is obviously that <a href="https://twitter.com/louwoodley">Lou Woodley</a> is no longer an organizer (as she announced at last year’s conference), but this is also the first SpotOn conference with a theme:</p><blockquote>The challenges of balancing the public and the private in the digital age</blockquote><p>This is obviously a very broad topic, but nicely encompasses many important issues that we are dealing with in scholarly communication today. The draft program is posted <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/13/spoton-london-2014-draft-programme">here</a>, and I’m helping organize the sessions on <strong><strong>sharing sensitive data</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>open peer review</strong></strong>. More details will follow for all these sessions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/2817131778_336979a571_z.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="640" height="480"><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dullhunk/2817131778/">Flickr photo by Duncan Hull</a></figcaption></figure><p>The second day of the conference will be in unconference (or barcamp) format and the program drafted by the delegates in the morning. This format is popular in the science communications community (I first heard about the project that became my current job at <a href="https://editor.front-matter.io/lets-do-an-unconference/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">SciBarCamp in 2009</a>), and SpotOn London has used this format in the first conference in 2008 (and again in 2009):</p><p>For people not familiar with this format the idea of a conference (day) without predetermined topics or speakers sounds scary. As it turns out, the problem is usually not the lack of ideas or people wanting to talk, but rather how to coordinate this in a way that everyone who wants to get involved can do so, and it doesn’t become a discussion among those with the loudest voices (and biggest egos). My experience with SpotOn London and other conferences I enjoyed is that the best sessions are usually those that allow for a good discussion, and not those with the most polished PowerPoint slides. Some suggestions for when you attend an unconference for the first time:</p><ul><li>go to sessions with topics you know little about, but want to learn more</li><li>when suggesting a session, do this together with others</li><li>suggest topics that are focussed and unusual, not the obvious ones we always talk about</li><li>don’t even think about doing a PowerPoint presentation</li><li>when moderating a session, be a good moderator, not a good speaker</li></ul><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp">Wikipedia: SciFoo</a></li><li><a href="http://blogs.nature.com/nascent/2007/08/barcamb_cambridge.html">Ian Mulvany: BarCamp Cambridge 2007</a></li><li><a href="http://science.easternblot.net/?p=613">Eva Amsen: SciBarCamp Toronto 2008</a></li><li><a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/action_points">Me: BibCamp Hannover 2010</a></li></ul>]]></content>

The problem is that not everything that is cited in a scholarly document ends up in the references list. Examples of this include:</p><ul><li>web links, e.g. to reagents or other resources</li><li>identifiers for biological databases such as GenBank that are typically included in the text as identifiers or as links</li><li>footnotes with links to external resources</li></ul><p>In other words: we are not consistent in how we cite other content. And this is a problem because we are making it more difficult than necessary for authors, publishers and everyone else to handle these various citation flavors and, more importantly, we are loosing citations along the way. This is a particular problem for data citation, as the seminal 2013 paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063184">Kafkas et al</a>. has shown for citations to the three biological databases ENA (European Nucleotide Archive), PDB and Uniprot:</p><ul><li>there is a large numbers of accession numbers in the Open Access subset of PubMed Central (e.g. 160,112 ENA accession numbers for papers published up until June 2012)</li><li>text mining using the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit/">Whatizit</a> tool can retrieve most of these identifiers</li><li>there is only partial overlap between database identifiers annotated by publishers and database identifiers found by text mining</li><li>the overlap is even smaller between papers citing database identifiers, and papers cited in biological databases such as ENA</li><li>the study was limited to Open Access journals, as only for them the full-text articles could be text mined</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/18th/ena_overlap.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="415" height="194"><figcaption>Comparison between article-to-database and database to citations (Kafkas et al., 2013).</figcaption></figure><p>In other words, even though including identifiers for biological databases has been an accepted community standard that every author and publisher is following for a long time, the proper citation of these identifiers is still often broken. The picture doesn’t seem to be any better for DOIs for datasets: while they are fairly common by now, their use in scholarly articles differs widely from appearance in the references list to links in the materials and methods section to no mention at all.</p><p>There are various ways how this can be fixed (e.g. requiring authors to use biological database identifiers in a consistent way, better text mining tools, opening up subscription content to text mining), but the best solution is the simplest one: every citation in a paper should go into the references list. As an example I have added the ENA mRNA U65091 (Shioda, Fenner, &amp; Isselbacher, 1997) - something I worked on a long time ago - to the references list of this post.</p><h2 id="technology">Technology</h2><p>For this to work, it is essential that reference managers - the software authors use to generate the references list - properly support citations to data, including biological databases. It appears that all major reference managers support datasets as reference type and there is good community agreement what a data citation should look like (<a href="https://www.force11.org/datacitation">Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles</a>). What is missing is support for easily importing the required metadata for these datasets, and reference managers use two approaches for this:</p><ul><li>query external databases via API and pull in the required metadata (e.g. Papers, Endnote)</li><li>browse to the webpage describing the database entry and import the metadata via bookmarklet/web importer (e.g. Zotero, Mendeley)</li></ul><p>Both approaches require custom code for every database. Whereas many reference managers use Citation Style Language (<a href="http://citationstyles.org/">CSL</a>) as a standard way to format references, no such standard exists for web importers. Which means that every reference manager has to implement this separately, and most of them are not open source software so that the community could help.</p><p>PLOS Labs is holding a <a href="http://www.ploslabs.org/citation-hackathon/">Citation Hackathon</a> on October 18 in their San Francisco office. While I can’t attend in person, I want to contribute to this hackathon in three ways:</p><ul><li>do an evaluation of how the reference managers Papers, Mendeley and Zotero (the three reference managers I use) support citations to the biological databases ENA, PDB and Uniprot and what is missing</li><li>look at existing aggregators of this information (e.g. <a href="http://identifiers.org/">Identifiers.org</a>) to figure out whether the import process can be simplified</li><li>start work on Zotero <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/translators/coding#web_translators">web translators</a> for these three databases. Zotero is open source software and the web translators are written in Javascript</li></ul><p>Please contact me if you are interested in helping with this, e.g. with a joint virtual hackathon on the 18th (or in person in London or Cambridge on October 15 if that works better).</p><p>Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMulvany">Ian Mulvany</a> from eLife and others from Papers and Mendeley we have also submitted a proposal for a pre-conference workshop/hackathon for the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015">Force2015 Conference</a> in January to work on this for a broader set of databases, which should for example also include software repositories. One question is how we properly handle the citation of large numbers of datasets (1000s to millions), we could for example allow a range of identifiers in a citation. We also need tools to convert identifiers and links in existing documents to proper references, something that we <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/citations-in-markdown-part-3/">have also discussed on this blog</a>, and we need to discuss how our bibliographic file formats (e.g. bibtex) support these citation types. I <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/citeproc-yaml-for-bibliographies/">said before</a> that I am a big fan of Citeproc YAML (or JSON, the bibliographic format used by CSL) as bibliographic exchange format, and I know that the PLOS Labs hackathon will also touch on this.</p><h2 id="community">Community</h2><p>While adding reference manager support for a wider range of citations is the first step, the bigger challenge is community support. I don’t think that it is a big mental jump for an author to use the reference manager to cite a biological database rather than typing in the identifier directly in the text (the hard work is registering the identifier in the first place), but this needs support by the community, and in particular journal editors. The important message is that citations should be done in a consistent way and authors don’t have to think about doing this differently for datasets or other relevant resources, or different publishers implementing this differently. I think the paper by Kafkas et al. (2013) clearly shows that our current recommendations for adding identifiers to biological databases is broken, and that we need to do something if we take data citation seriously.</p><p>There are several concerns about adding every citation to the references list. One of them is that we shouldn’t mix citations of scholarly articles with citations of other things, e.g. research data. I would argue that not only are we seeing an increasing number of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2011.10.002">citations to other resources in reference lists</a>, but that we can of course group citations by citation type, in addition to the sorting by appearance in the text or last name of first author that is common now.</p><p>Another concern is that citations of datasets are something else that citations to scholarly articles, because the former are typically citations of content created by the same group of people at the time the journal article was also created. I would argue that again we can highlight this by how we display the references, and that I hope that this changes once data citation becomes more widespread.</p><p>What should or should not be cited in a scholarly document is of course a big discussion topic. What I am arguing is that everything that is cited should go into the references list, but that doesn’t change at all what should be cited. Personal communications are an example of something that should probably not be cited and therefore should also not go into the references list.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Doing scientific research is becoming increasingly complex, both in terms of the tools and technologies used, and in the collaboration across disciplines and locations that is increasingly commonplace. While the way we write up and publish research is of course also very different from 25 years ago, I would argue that our tools and services haven’t quite evolved at the same pace.</p><p>Of course there are important trends that enable what the Royal Institution <a href="https://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/Report/">calls</a> <em>Science as an Open Enterprise</em>, most importantly Open Access, which has broken down many barriers for open collaboration. But very few organizations - commercial or non-profit - see it as their primary mission to make it easier for researchers to collaborate and produce great science, in the sense that everything else is secondary and this focus is really obvious to everyone.</p><p>The following are just some examples that make you laugh hard or cry out loud:</p><ul><li>Finding relevant scholarly content. Why is still so hard?</li><li>Reading a paper. The majority of scholalry content is still not Open Access. It is embarassing how difficult it can be to get the fulltext paper from a subscription journal - too slow, too expensive, and sometimes even crippled in functionality.</li><li>Creating figures for publication. This process is still so painful that it hurts. And publishers often create artificial limitations in file type (TIFF or Postscript) and file size (10 MB??).</li><li>Licenses for scholarly content. We don’t need choice, but a few licenses that everyone understands and that don’t hinder sharing and collaboration</li><li>Secure login. I can use my Facebook or Google login almost everywhere, but as a scholar I have a different username and password at my institution, funder, the various publishers I submit too, and the scholarly services I frequently use?</li><li>Citation styles. Why do we still have at least 3,000 styles?</li></ul><p>Citation styles is a perfect example of a problem that should have been solved as soon as we made the switch to digital publishing. I can travel through half of Europe without showing my passport, and using the same currency, but I need to reformat citations every time I submit to a different journal? And I have to use the same tool for this as my coauthors, as the different reference managers don’t work with each other?</p><p>Too often there are other intentions at work in parallel. While notable, they sometimes stand in conflict with the goal of making a researcher’s life easier. A perfect example is the manuscript submission process. In parallel to the tools getting better and easier to use, the demands on the author seem to be increasing at an even greater rate, both in the data and metadata he or she should provide, and in the work submitting authors are asked to do that traditionally have been done by publishers. Another good example are peer review and evaluation. The proportion of time spent doing research vs. time spent doing administrative work seems to decreasing and not increasing.</p><p>I wish more people and organizations would stand up and state that keeping it simple is their primary goal.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the important outcomes of the <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki">Markdown for Science</a> workshop that took place in June 2013 was a decision on a name - <em>Scholarly Markdown</em> - and a brief <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">definition</a>:</p><ol><li>Markdown that supports the requirements of scientific texts</li><li>Markdown as format that glues open scientific text resources together</li><li>A reference implementation with documentation and tests</li><li>A community</li></ol><p>In my eyes this is still a great definition. And this week something important happened that is very relevant for Scholarly Markdown. A small group of people deeply involved in Markdown announced <a href="http://commonmark.org/">Standard Markdown</a>:</p><blockquote>We propose a standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown, along with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown implementations against this specification. We believe this is necessary, even essential, for the future of Markdown.</blockquote><p>Markdown is in widespread use, but a lack of standard syntax and set of comprehensive tests has hindered the adoption for more complex use cases, the development of cross-platform tools, and the use of markdown as a document interchange format. I am therefore 100% behind this initiative. In particular since this is not just an initiative by large commercial organizations heavily using Markdown such as Stack Exchange, Github or Reddit, but that the entire spec and both reference implementations have been written by <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/">John MacFarlane</a>, the author of Pandoc, the universal document converter. Not only does Pandoc already support many of the features required by Scholarly Markdown (e.g. math and citations), but John is the Chair of the Department of Philosophy at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Markdown was developed in 2004 by John Gruber, and he <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/license">holds the rights</a> to the name Markdown. He didn’t want this initiative to use the name <strong><strong>Standard Markdown</strong></strong>, so the implementation was <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/">renamed</a> to <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>.</p><p>The consequences of all this for Scholarly Markdown?</p><ul><li>CommonMark focusses on the basic features of the language, but once the specification is agreed upon and implemented by a critical mass of tools, it is clear that there needs to be a standardized way to handle extensions of the language. This is both about features used by lots of people such as tables, but also functionality relevant only for scholarly content.</li><li>This brings us one gigantic step closer to a reference implementation and set of tests for Scholarly Markdown, as hopefully Scholarly Markdown can build upon the work by John and the CommonMark team.</li><li>The name Scholarly Markdown might not be a good idea going forward. We should either change the name to align with CommonMark, or we should come up with a totally different name, something that the screenwriters have done with <a href="http://fountain.io/">their</a> implementation of Markdown.</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.</p><p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong><strong>git</strong></strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p><p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p><pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre><pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre><p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p><p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p><p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong><strong>distributed version control system</strong></strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong><strong>Github</strong></strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g. Github issues for discussion and task management.</p><p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g. only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In July and August I attended the <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/">Open Knowledge Festival</a> and <a href="http://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Programme">Wikimania</a>. At both events I had many interesting discussions around open source tools for open access scholarly publishing, and I was part of a <a href="http://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/The_Full_OA_Stack_-_Open_Access_and_Open_Source">panel</a> on that topic at Wikimania last Sunday. Some of my thoughts were summarized in a blog post a few weeks ago (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/roads-not-stagecoaches/">Build Roads not Stagecoaches</a>). Today I am happy to announce the first public release of a tool that hopefully contributes to making publishing of open content a bit easier.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/rakali.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="LEGO Researchers are excited that they don’t have to use Microsoft Word for manuscript writing anymore." loading="lazy" width="1000" height="750"><figcaption>LEGO Researchers are excited that they don’t have to use Microsoft Word for manuscript writing anymore.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/rakali/rakali.rb">Rakali</a> is a Ruby gem that acts as a wrapper for the <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> universal document converter. Pandoc is a wonderful tool to convert documents between file formats and supports many file formats and features important for scholarly publishing. Pandoc 1.13 was <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/releases.html">released</a> last Friday, and one of the most exciting new features is a reader for Microsoft Word (<code>docx</code>) documents. Pandoc has supported the conversion to <code>docx</code> for a while, but now you can use the most popular file format for writing scholarly documents and turn your <code>docx</code> files into HTML, PDF, LateX, markdown, or a number of other formats, making it much easier to collaborate, and to use <code>docx</code> with Pandoc in scholarly publishing workflows. A good example would be arXiv, which <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/submit#text">doesn’t support</a> <code>docx</code> for text submissions. Instead of turning it into PDF the manuscript can now be converted to LaTeX - the preferred file format at arXiv - before submission.</p><p>I built <strong><strong>Rakali</strong></strong> to make it easier to use Pandoc to convert large numbers of documents in an automated way:</p><ul><li>bulk conversion of all files in a folder with a specific extension, e.g. <code>md</code>.</li><li>input via a configuration file in yaml format instead of via the command line</li><li>validation of documents via <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, using the <a href="https://github.com/hoxworth/json-schema">json-schema</a> Ruby gem.</li><li>Logging via <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>.</li></ul><p>One interesting way to use Rakali and Pandoc is as part of a <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/continuous-publishing/">continuous publishing</a> workflow that involves git and Github, automatically converting all files in a folder when something is pushed to the repository using a continuous integration tool, and exiting the continuous integration run when one of the files doesn’t validate. Look into the Rakali <a href="https://github.com/rakali/rakali.rb">repo</a> for an example.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of Rakali is probably validation via JSON Schema. File conversion with Pandoc is a two-step process, the intermediate format is an internal representation of the document in something called the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/the-grammar-of-scholarly-communication/">abstract syntax tree</a> or AST. Pandoc makes the AST accessible in JSON format, making it straightforward to manipulate a document before the conversion into the target format with something called <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html">JSON filters</a>.</p><p>Validation of XML documents using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">DTDs</a>, <a href="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a> and other standards has of course been around for a long time, but validation of JSON documents is still relatively new. Since many Pandoc document conversion workflows don’t involve any XML I thought it would make more sense to validate against the AST, and we can use JSON Schema for that. I have started a <a href="https://github.com/rakali/pandoc-schemata">Github repository</a> with schemata for the Pandoc AST, and hope to evolve them over time using Rakali as a tool. An example log output (from the Rakali test suite, stopping file conversion because title and layout metadata are missing) looks like this:</p><pre><code>Validation Error: The property '#/0/unMeta' did not contain a required property of 'title' in schema 9b6d454d-e609-537b-b761-9599b6c01072# for file empty.md
Validation Error: The property '#/0/unMeta' did not contain a required property of 'layout' in schema 9b6d454d-e609-537b-b761-9599b6c01072# for file empty.md
Fatal: Conversion of file empty.md failed.</code></pre><p>As I had argued before, the challenge for building open source tools for science is to <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/dont-reinvent-the-wheel/">not duplicate the work of others</a>, and to integrate well with existing tools by focussing on one aspect and doing that aspect well. It also helps to think about infrastructure (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/roads-not-stagecoaches/">the roads</a>) instead of only focussing on the user-facing aspects. There are obviously many document conversion tools out there, but Pandoc is certainly one of the oldest and most established ones for scholarly content. Rakali therefore builds on top of Pandoc and tries to play well with other existing tools and services, e.g. by using the UNIX <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> for reporting, and by using a file-based approach that works well with version control systems such as git. And since Rakali is a Ruby gem it can not only be used as a standalone command line tool, but can also be easily integrated into other Ruby applications.</p>]]></content>

Not only a very popular visualization library for the R language by Hadley Wickham, but also an implementation of Leland Wilkison’s Grammar of Graphics. The <a href="http://www.springer.com/statistics/computational+statistics/book/978-0-387-98140-6">ggplot2 book</a> describes this powerful concept (p. 14):</li></ul><blockquote>In brief, the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system. Faceting can be used to generate the same plot for different subsets of the dataset. It is the combination of these independent components that make up a graphic.</blockquote><h3 id="learn-to-use-at-least-one-visualization-tool">Learn to use at least one visualization tool</h3><p>There are many great tools available, pick one and learn it well. Some options include:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Excel</strong></strong>. Probably the most popular tool for data visualization. Commercial, with open source alternatives such as Libre Office.</li><li><strong><strong>R</strong></strong>. Software for statistical computing and analysis. Open source. <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> is a powerful user interface for R and a good way to get started.</li><li><a href="http://d3js.org/"><strong>d3.js</strong></a>. A visualization library for Javascript. Open source.</li><li><a href="http://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/"><strong>Prism</strong></a>. A popular visualization tool among scientists. Commercial.</li><li><a href="https://datawrapper.de/"><strong>Datawrapper</strong></a>. An open source tool and hosted service for data visualization.</li></ul><p>I do most visualizations in either R or d3.js. Both are open source tools with a large community and a rich set of libraries, examples and documentation, and both take a systematic approach to data visualization (see grammar of graphics above).</p><h3 id="learn-data-analysis">Learn data analysis</h3><p>Unless your interest is more in information design - see <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/">Information is beautiful</a> for some great examples - data visualization is tightly coupled with data analysis. You need to know at least the basics of data analysis to do proper data visualizations, e.g. how to handle wrongly formatted data (e.g. text in a number column), missing values and outliers. The most time-consuming step in my experience is data transformation, i.e. bringing data into the format that you want for the analysis and visualization.</p><p>R, Python and the relatively new <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> are popular languages for data analysis available as open source. There are many packages for these languages that help with common data analysis problems. One additional advantage of using a proper language over a set of tools cobbled together is that it is easy to automatically recreate a visualization with a new set of data - convenient when you need to analyze and visualize an ongoing experiment that repeatedly produces new data.</p><h3 id="use-a-vector-file-format">Use a vector file format</h3><p>Too many scientific data are still visualized using bitmap graphic formats such as <code>tiff</code>, <code>jpg</code> and <code>png</code>. These formats are not appropriate for charts and only make sense for images. They don’t scale to the screen resolution, and it is <a href="http://blog.f1000research.com/2014/02/20/the-importance-of-providing-data-and-not-just-images-of-data/">very hard to impossible</a> to reuse or even modify them. Use vector graphic formats such as <code>svg</code> or <code>pdf</code> instead. <code>svg</code> is my preferred format because in contrast to <code>pdf</code> it can be embedded into a larger HTML document, and R and d3.js (my preferred visualization tools) can generate this format. <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> is an open source SVG editor, and the commercial <strong><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></strong> can be used to manually polish graphics in <code>svg</code> or <code>pdf</code> format, e.g. for journal publication.</p><h3 id="get-inspired-by-great-visualizations">Get inspired by great visualizations</h3><p>At the end of the day data visualization is all about telling a story with data. Unfortunately the current state of affairs for scientific visualizations is very different. In my opinion most graphs and figures used in publications don’t provide the data underlying the visualization (<a href="https://datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> is a great example how this can be done), focus too much on detail rather than the overall message, don’t take advantage of the different chart types available, and are sometimes even misleading. And I’m not even talking about the fact that figures in scholarly papers are <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1">almost never</a> interactive. It rarely happens that I read a paper and get excited by looking at a figure - if I do it is usually because the underlying data are so compelling that even the simplest visualization will convey the right message.</p><p>We should become more creative with visualizing data in scholarly documents, and one important step towards that goal is publishers accepting more reasonable file formats in manuscript submissions - instead of just <code>tiff</code> and <code>eps</code> (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/figureGuidelines#figures">PLOS</a>), or <code>tiff</code>, <code>eps</code> and <code>pdf</code> (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo/prep/prep_revfigs.xhtml#format">Science</a>), and often with a 10 MB file site limit.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Sunday <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmulvany">Ian Mulvany</a> and I will do a presentation on <a href="http://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/Open_Scholarship_Tools_-_a_whirlwind_tour.">Open Scholarship Tools</a> at <em>Wikimania 2014</em> in London. From the abstract:</p><blockquote>This presentation will give a broad overview of tools and standards that are helping with Open Scholarship today.</blockquote><p>One of the four broad topics we have picked are <em>digital object identifiers (DOI)s</em>. We want to introduce them to people new to them, and we want to show some tricks and cool things to people who already now them. Along the way we will also try to debunk some myths about DOIs.</p><h3 id="what-a-doi-looks-like">What a DOI looks like</h3><p>DOIs - or better DOI names - start with a prefix in the format <code>10.x</code> where x is 4-5 digits. The suffix is determined by the organization registering the DOI, and there is no consistent pattern across organizations. The DOI name is typically expressed as a URL (see below). An example DOI would look like: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345678">http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345678</a>. Something in the format <strong><strong>10/hvx</strong></strong> or <a href="http://doi.org/hvx">http://doi.org/hvx</a> is a <a href="http://shortdoi.org/">shortDOI</a>, and <strong><strong>1721.1/26698</strong></strong> or <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/26698">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/26698</a> is a handle. BTW, all DOIs names are also handles, so <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10/hvx">http://hdl.handle.net/10/hvx</a> for the shortDOI example above will resolve correctly.</p><h3 id="dois-are-persistent-identifiers">DOIs are persistent identifiers</h3><p>Links to resources can change, particularly over long periods of time. Persistent identifiers are needed so that readers can still find the content we reference in a scholarly work (or anything else where persistent linking is important) 10 or 50 years later. There are many kinds of persistent identifiers, one of the key concepts - and a major difference to URLs - is to separate the identifier for the resource from its location. Persistent identifiers require technical infrastructure to resolve identifiers (DOIs use the <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handle System</a>) and to allow long-term archiving of resources. DOI registration agencies such as DataCite or CrossRef are required to provide that persistence. Other persistent identifier schemes besides DOIs include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PURL">persistent uniform resource locators (PURLs)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archival_Resource_Key">Archival Resource Keys (ARKs)</a>.</p><h3 id="dois-have-attached-metadata">DOIs have attached metadata</h3><p>All DOIs have metadata attached to them. The metadata are supplied by the resource provider, e.g. publisher, and exposed in services run by registration agencies, for example metadata search and content negotiation (see below). There is a minimal set of required metadata for every DOI, but beyond that, different registration agencies will use different metadata schemata, and most metadata are optional. Metadata are important to build centralized discovery services, making it easier to describe a resource, e.g. journal article citing another article. Some of the more recent additions to metadata schemata include persistent identifiers for people (<a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) and funding agencies (<a href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef</a>), and license information. The following API call will retrieve all publications registered with CrossRef that use a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> (and where this information has been provided by the publisher):</p><pre><code>http://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100000001/works?filter=license.url:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US</code></pre><h3 id="dois-support-link-tracking">DOIs support link tracking</h3><p>Links to other resources are an important part of the metadata, and describing all citations between a large number scholarly documents is a task that can only really be accomplished by a central resource. To solve this very problem DOIs were invented and the CrossRef organization started around 15 years ago.</p><h3 id="not-every-doi-is-the-same">Not every DOI is the same</h3><p>The DOI system <a href="http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/1_Introduction.html">originated from an initiative by scholarly publishers</a> (first announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1997), with citation linking of journal articles its first application. This citation linking system is managed by <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a>, a non-profit member organization of scholarly publishers, and <a href="http://search.crossref.org/help/status">more than half</a> of the about <a href="http://www.doi.org/faq.html">100 million DOIs</a> that have been assigned to date are managed by them.</p><p>But many DOIs are assigned by one of the other 8 <a href="http://www.doi.org/RA_Coverage.html">registration agencies</a>. You probably know <a href="http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, but did you know that the <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/index_en.htm">Publications Office of the European Union (OP)</a> and the <a href="http://www.eidr.org/">Entertainment Identifier Registry (EIDR)</a> also assign DOIs? The distinction is important, because some of the functionality is a service of the registration agency - metadata search for example is offered by CrossRef (<a href="http://search.crossref.org/">http://search.crossref.org</a>) and DataCite (<a href="http://search.datacite.org/">http://search.datacite.org</a>), but you can’t search for a DataCite DOI in the CrossRef metadata search. There is an API to find out the registration agency behind a DOI so that you know what services to expect:</p><pre><code>http://api.crossref.org/works/10.6084/m9.figshare.821213/agency

{
  "status": "ok",
  "message-type": "work-agency",
  "message-version": "1.0.0",
  "message": {
    "DOI": "10.6084/m9.figshare.821213",
    "agency": {
      "id": "datacite",
      "label": "DataCite"
    }
  }
}</code></pre><h3 id="dois-are-urls">DOIs are URLs</h3><p><a href="http://www.doi.org/faq.html">DOI names may be expressed as URLs (URIs) through a HTTP proxy server</a> - e.g. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345679">http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345679</a>, and this is how DOIs are typically resolved. For this reason the <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/doi_display_guidelines.htm">CrossRef DOI Display Guidelines</a> recommend that <em>CrossRef DOIs should always be displayed as permanent URLs in the online environment</em>. Because DOIs can be expressed as URLs, they also have their features:</p><h4 id="special-characters">Special characters</h4><p>Because DOIs can be expressed as URLs, DOIs <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/15doi_guidelines.html">should only include characters allowed in URLs</a>, something that wasn’t always true in the past and can cause problems, e.g. when using SICIs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier">Serial Item and Contribution Identifier</a>), an extension of the ISSN for journals:</p><pre><code>10.4567/0361-9230(1997)42:&lt;OaEoSR&gt;2.0.TX;2-B</code></pre><h4 id="content-negotiation">Content negotiation</h4><p>The DOI resolver at <em>doi.org</em> (or <em>dx.doi.org</em>) normally resolves to the resource location, e.g. a landing page at a publisher website. Requests that are not for content type <code>text/html</code> are redirected to the registration agency metadata service (currently for CrossRef, DataCite and mEDRA DOIs). Using <a href="http://www.crosscite.org/cn/">content negotiation</a>, we can ask the metadata service to send us the metadata in a format we specify (e.g. Citeproc JSON, bibtex or even a formatted citation in one of thousands of citation styles) instead of getting redirected to the resource. This is a great way to collect bibliographic information, e.g. to format citations for a manuscript. In theory we could also use content negotiation to get a particular representation of a resource, e.g. <code>application/pdf</code> for a PDF of a paper or <code>text/csv</code> for a dataset in CSV format. This is not widely support and I don’t know the details of the implementation in the DOI resolver, but you can try this (content negotation is easier with the command line than with a browser):</p><pre><code>curl -LH "Accept: application/pdf" http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500 &gt;peerj.500.pdf</code></pre><p>This will save the PDF of the 500th PeerJ paper published last week.</p><h4 id="fragment-identifiers">Fragment identifiers</h4><p>As discussed in <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/fragment-identifiers-and-dois/">my last blog post</a>, we can use fragment identifiers to subsections of a document with DOIs, e.g. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2</a> or <a href="http://doi.org/10.5446/12780#t=00:20,00:27">http://doi.org/10.5446/12780#t=00:20,00:27</a>, just as we can with every other URL. This is a nice way to directly link to a specific document section, e.g. when discussing a paper on Twitter. Fragment identifiers are implemented by the client (typically web browser) and depend on the document type, but for DOIs that resolve to full-text HTML documents they can add granularity to the DOI without much effort.</p><h4 id="queries">Queries</h4><p>URLs obviously support queries, but that is a feature I haven’t yet seen with DOIs. Queries would allow interesting features, partly overlapping with what is possible with fragment identifiers and content negotiation, e.g. <code><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500?format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500?format=pdf</a></code>. II hope to find out more until Sunday.</p><h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3><p>My biggest wish? Make DOIs more machine-readable. They are primarily intended for human users, enabling them to find the content associated with a DOI. But they sometimes don’t work as well as they could with automated tools, one example are the <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/broken-dois/">challenges automatically resolving a DOI</a> that I described in a blog post last year. Thinking about DOIs as URLs - and using them this way - is the right direction.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before all our content turned digital, we already used <strong><strong>page numbers</strong></strong> to describe a specific section of a book or longer document, with older manuscripts using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio">folio</a> before that. Page numbers have transitioned to electronic books with readers such as the Kindle <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/page-numbers-for-kindle-books-an-imperfect-solution/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">supporting them eventually</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/Folio_(number).jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="746" height="543"><figcaption>Image by Al Silonov from <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Folio_(number).jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>. This file is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</a> license.</figcaption></figure><p>For content on the web we can use the <code>#</code> fragment identifier, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals</a> to navigate to a specific section of a web page. How the linking to this fragment is handled, depends on the <strong><strong>MIME</strong></strong> type of the document, and will for example be done differently for a text page than a video - YouTube understands minutes and seconds into a video as fragment identifier, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UNRZEsLxKc#t=54m52s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UNRZEsLxKc#t=54m52s</a>. Fragment identifiers are not only helpful to link to a subsection of a document, but of course also for navigation within a document.</p><p>All this is of course very relevant to scholarly content, which is usually much more structured, with most journal articles following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD">IMRAD</a> - introduction, methods, results, and discussion - format, usually with additional sections such as abstract, references, etc. One approach to link to figures and tables within a scholarly articles is using <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">component DOIs</a>, e.g. specific DOIs for parts of a larger document. The publisher <strong><strong>PLOS</strong></strong> has been using them for a long time, and the <a href="https://editor.front-matter.io/2014/07/24/dont-reinvent-the-wheel/">number of component DOIs is rising</a>, but most scholarly journal articles don’t use component DOIs. And whereas component DOIs are a great concept for content such as figures (allowing us to describe the MIME type and other relevant metadata), they are probably not the best tool to link to a section or paragraph of a scholarly document.</p><p>As it turns out, we already have a tool for that, as the DOI proxy server gracefully forwards fragment identifiers (how did I miss this?). We can therefore use a DOI with a fragment identifier to</p><ul><li>Results section: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2</a></li><li>Specific reference: <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1#ref-7">http://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1#ref-7</a></li><li>Decision letter: <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471#decision-letter">http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471#decision-letter</a></li></ul><p>Obviously this only works if the DOI is resolved to the full-text of a resource, and not a landing page. And how the fragment identifiers are named and implemented is up to the publisher, and the DOI resolver has no information about them. These specific links are particularly nice for discussions of a paper, whether it is on Twitter or in a discussion forum. It appears that at least the Twitter link shortener keeps the fragment identifier, the link to the eLife decision letter is shortened to <a href="http://t.co/URWaYmGHnY">http://t.co/URWaYmGHnY</a>. This kind of linking works particularly well if the publisher is using a fine-grained system of fragment identifiers, the publisher PeerJ for example allows links to a specific paragraph - e.g. <a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500#p-15">http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500#p-15</a> - and allows users to <a href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/62886292466/peerj-questions-a-new-way-to-never-publish-forget">ask a question</a> right next to that section.</p><p>The examples above all use MIME type <code>text/html</code>, as this is what the example DOIs resolve to by default. I don’t if and how publishers have implemented fragment identifiers for other formats such as PDF or ePub, and what happens if you combine fragment identifiers with <a href="http://www.crosscite.org/cn/">content negotiation</a>. The shortDOI service works with fragment identifiers as well: <a href="http://doi.org/pxd#decision-letter">http://doi.org/pxd#decision-letter</a>. Another interesting question would be how fragment identifiers are handled for datasets. Typically separate DOIs are assigned for multiple related datasets, but there could also be a place for fragment identifiers as well, e.g. to specify a subset via a date range. The solution depends again on the content type, and the popular <code>text/csv</code> is unfortunately not well suited for this, whereas JSON – using <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON Pointer</a> – would work well.</p><p><em>Update 8/2/14: <a href="https://twitter.com/ldodds">Leigh Dodds</a> points out that handling the fragment identifier is up to the client and the fragment identifier is not sent to the server. Acrobat reader for example supports the <code>#page=</code> fragment identifier. He also mentions that there is a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111">RFC7111</a> for fragment identifiers for the text/csv media type - browsers in the future might support something like <code><a href="http://example.com/data.csv#row=5-7" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/data.csv#row=5-7</a></code>.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.</blockquote><p>Yesterday 60 years ago the first volume of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy by <em>J.R.R. Tolkien</em> was published. The quote above obviously doesn’t quiet apply to scholarly publishing, but one recurring theme that I have often heard in the last few years is that of a need for a canonical digital document format for scholarly content that rules all other formats.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/rings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Document formats in scholarly Publishing" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Document formats in scholarly Publishing</figcaption></figure><p>A few years ago almost everyone you would have said that <code>xml</code> is that format, with the NLM Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite - which has evolved into <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">JATS</a> - probably the most commonly used Document Type Definition (DTD). <code>xml</code> does many things really well, but also has important shortcomings, most importantly that it is probably not a good format for authors (and don’t tell me that <code>docx</code> and <code>odt</code> are XML-based). We therefore don’t really expect authors to submit manuscripts in JATS <code>xml</code>, but rather convert documents into this format after a manuscript has been accepted for publication. This conversion step is often time-consuming and labor-intensive.</p><p>More recently <code>html</code> has become the most interesting candidate for a canonical scholarly document format. The big advantage over <code>xml</code> is that <code>html</code> - or at least <code>html5</code> which is most popular today - is an attractive format for online authoring tools (that is why <code>html</code> is listed both as input and output format) The downside of this flexibility is that it is much harder to embed structure and metadata into <code>html5</code> compared to <code>xml</code>. There are initiatives such as <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook">HTMLBook</a> that hope to change that, but we aren’t quite there yet.</p><p>Or maybe we should learn from Tolkien and give up on the idea of a canonical document format and rather spend our energy on building tools that make it easier to transition from one format to another. <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> is such as tool, but can’t do all the required conversions, e.g. it can’t yet use <code>docx</code> as input. The downside here is that every file conversion runs the risk of loosing important information. But the increase in flexibility hopefully outweights these shortcomings.</p>]]></content>

One important aspect of that infrastructure work is to not duplicate efforts.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/5673321593_e6a7faa36d_z.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="478" height="640"><figcaption>Image by Cocoabiscuit <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jfgallery/5673321593/">on Flickr</a></figcaption></figure><p>A good example is information (or metadata) about scholarly publications. I am the technical lead for the open source <a href="http://articlemetrics.github.io/">article-level metrics (ALM) software</a>. This software can be used in different ways, but most people use it for tracking the metrics of scholarly articles, with articles that have DOIs issued by CrossRef. The ALM software needs three pieces of information for every article: <strong><strong>DOI</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>publication date</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>title</strong></strong>. This information can be entered via a web interface, but that is of course not very practical for adding dozens or hundreds of articles at a time. The ALM software has therefore long supported the import of multiple articles via a text file and the command line.</p><p>This approach is working fine for the ALM software <a href="http://articlemetrics.github.io/plos/">running at PLOS since 2009</a>, but is for example a problem if the ALM software runs as a service for multiple publishers. A more flexible approach is to provide an API to upload articles, and I’ve <a href="http://articlemetrics.github.io/docs/api/">added an API</a> for creating, updating and deleting articles in January 2014.</p><p>While the API is an improvement, it still requires the integration into a number of possibly very different publisher workflows, and you have to deal with setting up the permissions, e.g. so that publisher A can’t delete an article from publisher B.</p><p>The next ALM release (3.3) will therefore add a third approach to importing articles: using the <a href="http://api.crossref.org/">CrossRef API</a> to look up article information. Article-level metrics is about tracking already published works, so we really only care about articles that have DOIs registered with CrossRef and are therefore published. ALM is now talking to a single API, and this makes it much easier to do this for a number of publishers without writing custom code. Since ALM is an open source application already used by several publishers that aspect is important. And because we are importing, we have don’t have to worry about permissions. The only requirement is that CrossRef has the correct article information, and has this information as soon as possible after publication.</p><p>At this point I have a confession to make: I regularly use other CrossRef APIs, but wasn’t aware of <strong><strong>api.crossref.org</strong></strong> until fairly recently. That is sort of understandable since the reference platform was deployed only September last year. The documentation to get you started is on <a href="https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md">Github</a> and the version history shows frequent API updates (now at v22). The API will return all kinds of information, e.g.</p><ul><li>how many articles has publisher x published in 2012</li><li>percentage of DOIs of publisher Y that include at least one ORCID identifier</li><li>list all books with a Creative Commons CC-BY license that were published this year</li></ul><p>Funder (via FundRef) information is also included, but is still incomplete. Another interesting result is the number of <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">component DOIs</a> (DOIs for figures, tables or other parts of a document) per year:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe title="Component DOIs per year" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-4AxDk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4AxDk/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="268"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>For my specific use case I wanted an API call that returns all articles published by PLOS (or any other publisher) in the last day which I can then run regularly. To get all DOIs from a specific publisher, use their CrossRef member ID - DOI prefixes don’t work, as publishers can own more than one DOI prefix. To make this task a little easier I built a CrossRef member search interface into the ALM application:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/crossref_api.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1170" height="774"></figure><p>We can filter API responses by publication date, but it is a better idea to use the update date, as it is possible that the metadata have changed, e.g. a correction of the title. We also want to increase the number of results per page (using the <code>rows</code> parameter). The final API call for all DOIs updated by PLOS since the beginning of the week would be</p><pre><code>http://api.crossref.org/members/340/works?filter=from-update-date:2014-07-21,until-update-date:2014-07-24&amp;rows=1000</code></pre><p>The next step is of course to parse the JSON of the API response, and you will notice that CrossRef is using <a href="http://gsl-nagoya-u.net/http/pub/citeproc-doc.html">Citeproc JSON</a>. This is a standard JSON format for bibliographic information used internally by several reference managers for citation styles, but increasingly also by APIs and other places where you encounter bibliographic information.</p><p>Citeproc JSON is helpful for one particular problem with CrossRef metadata: the exact publication date for an article is not always known, and CrossRef (and similarly DataCite) only requires the publication year. Citeproc JSON can nicely handle partial dates, e.g. year-month:</p><pre><code>issued: {
  date-parts: [
    [
      2014,
      7
    ]
  ]
},</code></pre><p>I think that a similar approach will work for many other systems that require bibliographic information about scholarly content with CrossRef DOIs. If are not already using <strong><strong>api.crossref.org</strong></strong>, consider integrating with it, I find the API fast, well documented, easy to use - and CrossRef is very responsive to feedback. As you can always wish for more, I would like to see the following: fix the problem were some journal articles are missing the publication date (a required field, even if only the year), and consider adding the canonical URL to the article metadata (which ALM currently has to look up itself, and which is needed to track social media coverage of an article).</p><p><em>Update July 24, 2014: added chart with number of component DOIs per year</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended the <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/">Open Knowledge Festival</a> this week and I had a blast. For three days (I also attended the fringe event <a href="http://csvconf.com/">csv,conf</a> on Tuesday) I listed to wonderful presentations and was involved in great discussions - both within sessions, but more importantly all the informal discussions between and after sessions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/okfest-2014-logo.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="900" height="344"></figure><p>Of all the things that were discussed I want to pick one theme that resonated in particular with me. It surfaced in many places, but was articulated particularly well by <a href="https://twitter.com/erichysen">Eric Hysen</a> - who heads the <a href="http://www.google.com/elections/ed/us">Google Politics &amp; Elections Group</a> - in his keynote yesterday (starting at 54:52, but please also watch the keynote by Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0UNRZEsLxKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>In his keynote he described how travel from Cambridge to London in the 18th and early 19th century improved mainly as a result of better roads, made possible by changes in how these roads were financed. Translated to today, he urged the audience to think more about the infrastructure and less about the end products:</p><blockquote>Ecosystems, not apps – Eric Hysen</blockquote><p>On Tuesday at <a href="http://csvconf.com/#nickstenning">csv,conf</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickstenning">Nick Stenning</a> - Technical Director of the Open Knowledge Foundation - talked about <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/">data packages</a>, an evolving standard to describe data that are passed around betwen different systems. He used the metaphor of containers, and how they have dramatically changed the transportation of goods in the last 50 years. He <a href="https://github.com/nickstenning/put-it-in-a-box">argued</a> that the cost of shipping was in large part determined by the cost of loading and unloading, and the container has dramatically changed that equation. We are in a very similar situation with datasets, where most of the time is spent translating between different formats, joining things together that use different names for the same thing, etc.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/break-bulk-sacks.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1543" height="1087"><figcaption><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hafenarbeiter_bei_der_Verladung_von_Sackgut_-_MS_Rothenstein_NDL,_Port_Sudan_1960.png">Wikimedia Commons</a> image used in <a href="https://github.com/nickstenning/put-it-in-a-box">Nick Stelling's presentation</a></figcaption></figure><p>What the two presentations have in common is not only that they link the building of an open digital infrastructure to important transforming events in the history of transportation, but also the emphasis on the building blocks rather than the finished product. When I thought more about this I realized that these building blocks are exactly the projects I get most excited about, i.e. projects that develop standards or provide APIs or libraries. Some examples would be</p><ul><li><a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>: unique identifiers for scholarly authors</li><li><a href="http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a>: a language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies</li><li><a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>: a universal document converter</li><li><a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>: packages for the statistical programming language R to access data repositories</li><li><a href="http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics_initiative/">NISO Alternative Assessment Metrics</a>: standards and best practices for novel scholarly metrics</li><li><a href="http://www.re3data.org/">re3data</a>: a registry of research data repositories</li><li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>: copyright licenses for creative works</li><li><a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">ALM</a>: software to collect comprehensive information about the discussion of scholarly articles on the web</li></ul><p>This list doesn’t include all the generic software needed to build open science tools, with <strong>git</strong> being a perfect example. The last project is obviously the project I have been working on the past two years for PLOS, but I have tried to support the other projects mentioned in various ways from small code contributions to promotion via this blog and presentations, or direct work in these projects. But strangely enough, I haven’t really realized this until now.</p><p>Not surprisingly infrastructure, servers, libraries and other building blocks are exactly the areas where open source software has been most successful so far, and this is of course a core part of the UNIX philosophy of building parts that work well together rather than big monolithic programs that do everything.</p><h2 id="next">Next</h2><p>We need more <strong><strong>Open Science Infrastructure</strong></strong> and it is the stuff that I really care about. I think we need to better support those projects that build these essential building blocks via advice, cooperation, promotion, and financial support. I am willing to help with that effort, and I have started to think how I can best contribute.</p><p>On the other hand there are many great open science projects that don’t fall in this category, maybe even the majority of them. I wish them good luck, but I would advice them to think more about infrastructure, and whether there is a small area where they can focus on. It still amazes me how successful projects such as <strong><strong>Citation Style Language</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Pandoc</strong></strong> have been with no or almost no funding and a very small core group of people doing the majority of the work. One critical ingredient is the total focus on a very specific problem that is both important and can be solved with specific actions. Too many open science projects want to solve too many problems at once, try to solve the exact same problems that many other parallel projects work on, don’t cooperate enough with those parallel projects, and require a critical mass of users to work.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the World Wide Web.</blockquote><p>Literate Programming by <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/">Donald Knuth</a> (1983) is a seminal book that introduces the concept of literate programming. Using technology available in 2014 we can make a small but important change to the last sentence:</p><blockquote>The program is also viewed as a hypertext document on the World Wide Web.</blockquote><p>This blog post is an example for such a document. The page is written in <strong><strong>markdown</strong></strong> (markdown file available <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/mfenner.github.io/blob/source/_posts/2014-04-04-literate-blogging.Rmd">here</a>), and all embedded code was executed when this page was generated, i.e. when the markdown was converted to HTML and the blog post was published. To demonstrate this I have embedded code in three different languages below - the output is the second code block.</p><p>In R you have</p><pre><code>cat('Hello, R world!\n')</code></pre><pre><code>Hello, R world!</code></pre><p>Or Python</p><pre><code>print "Hello, Python world!"</code></pre><pre><code>Hello, Python world!</code></pre><p>Or Ruby</p><pre><code>puts 'Hello, Ruby world!'</code></pre><pre><code>Hello, Ruby world!</code></pre><p>You can also embed code within text blocks (inline), so that <code>3.48 * 723</code> becomes <strong><strong>2516.04</strong></strong>. Another important option is to generate figures using the embedded code, e.g. the following figure taken from a recent publication.</p><pre><code># code for figure 1: density plots for citation counts for PLOS Biology

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week Björn Brembs wrote in a blog post (<a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/03/what-is-the-difference-between-text-data-and-code/">What Is The Difference Between Text, Data And Code?</a>):</p><blockquote>To sum it up: our intellectual output today manifests itself in code, data and text.</blockquote><p>The post is about the importance of publication of data and software where currently <em>the rewards are stacked disproportionately in favor of text publications</em>. The intended audience is probably mainly other scientists (Björn is a neurobiologist) who are reluctant to publish data and/or code, but there is another interesting aspect to this.</p><p>Just as scientific publication increasingly means more than just text and includes data and software, we are also increasingly seeing tools and methodologies common in software development applied to scientific publishing. This in particular includes the ideas behind Open Source software (which shares many commonalities with Open Access and Open Science), but also tools like the git version control system (<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science/">We Need a Github of Science</a>) or the markdown markdown language (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">A Call for Scholarly Markdown</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/Agile-vs-iterative-flow.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="672" height="335"><figcaption>Delivery, image from <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Agile-vs-iterative-flow.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></figcaption></figure><p>Continuous Delivery is another concept increasingly popular in software development that has many implications on how research can be performed and reported. Martin Fowler describes it as:</p><blockquote>Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.</blockquote><p>The concept of frequent small releases is of course familiar to everyone practicing <a href="http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/">Open Notebook Science</a>, writing science blogs, presenting preliminary data at conferences or publishing <a href="http://arxiv.org/">preprints</a>, and is even relevant to <a href="http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/">CrossMark</a>, a service that tracks corrections, enhancements and other changes of scholarly documents.</p><p>When you read the definition given by Martin Fowler carefully, you see that Continuous Delivery is about more than the frequency of software updates – it is in fact about improving the process of releasing software. The scientific publication is the corresponding event in science, and I think that nobody would argue with me that the experience publishing a paper is too complex, time-consuming and often frustrating. The focus here is not on the time it takes to do peer review, or the multiple revisions needed before a manuscript is accepted. I am talking about the pain submitting a manuscript, the back and forth regarding file formats, citation styles and other technical requirements, the reformatting of manuscripts, and also the time it takes from accepting a manuscript to finally publishing it online.</p><p>I would argue that the main reason publishing is so painful for everyone involved is that it is still very much a manual process. Just as software development is creative work, but still can benefit tremendously from tools such as automated tests and build tools, we can apply the same principles to scientific publishing. This means that everything that can be automated should be automated so that we can focus on those areas that need human judgement. The mistake that I think is commonly made is that automation for many publishers means automation for the publisher, with even more work for the author who submits a manuscript. A good example is that authors are increasingly asked to submit publication-ready manuscripts even though typesetting and desktop publishing is not their area of expertise and the manuscript text will be very different after one or more rounds of revision. The pain of processing manuscripts into something that can be published was summarized perfectly by typesetter and friend Kaveh Bazargan at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=CGkcsvofjdg">SpotOn London 2012 Conference</a> (via <a href="http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/11/19/yet-another-solo12-recap-part2/">Ross Mounce’s blog</a>):</p><blockquote>It’s madness really. I’m here to say I shouldn’t be in business.</blockquote><p>The promise of Continuous Delivery for publishing is to develop tools and best practices that make the process of publication faster, with better quality, and less frustrating. Continuous Integration (<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">again Martin Fowler</a>) is an important part of Continuous Delivery and means frequently merging all developer working copies of a software project into a central repository, combined with running automated unit tests and software builds using an integration server.</p><p>We can apply Continuous Integration to scholarly documents - instead of automated tests and software builds we can automate the transformation of documents into <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/from-markdown-to-jats-xml-in-one-step/">JATS XML</a> and other output formats, and we can automate the process of checking for required metadata, correct file formats for images, etc. And we can use the same software tools for this, many of which are freely available to Open Source projects.</p><p>As an example of how this can be done <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis">I have integrated</a> the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> Continuous Integration server with the book project <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/">Opening Science</a>. The recently published book is a dynamic book that hopefully is updated frequently in the coming months. Every time an editor approves a correction to the text - <a href="https://github.com/openingscience/book">hosted in markdown format on Github</a> - the Travis CI server is automatically triggered to build a new HTML version of the book and to push the new version to the book website. The Travis server is running the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> document converter to not only convert the changed document from markdown to HTML, but Pandoc will also insert and format references, and the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site generator will build a nice website around the markdown files. Over time this build process can be extended to do other things as well, from <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">auto-generating links to data and resources</a> to transforming the document into <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/from-markdown-to-jats-xml-in-one-step/">other file formats</a> besides HTML.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had a little discussion on Twitter about a great blog post by Zach Holman: <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/only-90s-developers/">Only 90s Web Developers Remember This</a>. The post is not only fun to read, but also reminded me that it is now almost 20 years (1995) that I built my first website - of course using some of the techniques (the one pixel gif!, the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tag!) described in the post.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/scriptwebtitle.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="250" height="50"><figcaption>ScriptWeb logo 1995</figcaption></figure><p>We started ScriptWeb back in 1995 as a central resource for scripting on the Mac (AppleScript and Frontier). It was a nice collaborative effort and I was resposible for a directory of scripting additions (or osaxen), joining forces with MacScripter.net a few years later:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/osaxen.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="587" height="639"><figcaption>Scripting Additions at Macscripter.net 2000</figcaption></figure><p>Since then I have built many other websites for fun and work, adapting to how technology changed over the years:</p><ul><li>1995: website running on a Mac Quadra 610 using the WebSTAR HTTP server and server side includes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">SSI</a>)</li><li>1995: static site generation with outline navigation using AppleScript. FTP to transfer files</li><li>1995: Visual HTML editors (Adobe PageMill 1.0)</li><li>1999: database server and application layer (too long ago to remember the technology)</li><li>2001: Open source database and application code with MySQL and PHP. CVS for version control</li><li>2001: web frameworks with PHP and MySQL: PostNuke and Xaraya</li><li>2005: more complex web application frameworks: Ruby on Rails. Subversion version control</li><li>2008: git for version control</li><li>2011: more complex frontend Javascript</li><li>2013: static site generator Jekyll</li></ul><p>Since last June this blog is running on Github pages and the site is generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll works really well to build static websites such as this blog, but I am increasingly using it for more complex projects, e.g. for the online version of a <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/">book on Open Science</a>.</p><p>What I find interesting in this timeline is that with Jekyll there is a shift in focus. Rather than building even more complex web pages that are generated dynamically by the server, we are going back to a two-stage process where the HTML pages are built first and then served as HTML, CSS and Javascript without any database or server application layer. Doesn’t sound too different from what we did in the 1990s. This approach obviously works well for content-heavy sites like this blog or book chapters, not so much for dynamically generated content that changes every few minutes, or where the page is put together from many different page fragments.</p><p>What I don’t know, and I am really interested to find out, is how well this scales to larger sites, specifically publisher websites that host thousands of scholarly journal articles - again content that is very text-heavy and doesn’t change that much. The potential benefits of replacing the paradigm of a database layer that holds all content with a paradigm that stores all content in files managed by git version control are clear: serving the content on the web becomes less complex, cheaper and faster. The tradeoff is of course that generating the static content becomes more complex and time-consuming, and it can become a challenge to mix the static content with dynamic content generated by servers as well as the user’s browser. For a now infamous example using this technology, look no further than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-pavley/obamacare-website-problems_b_4057618.html">Heathcare.gov</a>. I don’t know enough details to understand what went wrong, and it might have more to do with the scale of the project and the tight timeline to launch. For scholarly journal articles this might be a reasonable approach, as even when there is no longer a printed version of the journal, articles are still published on a specific date, and changing the content is a very formal process.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/3781208877_936e1a162c_z.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="640" height="427"><figcaption>Netscape Navigator 1. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bump/3781208877/">Flickr photo</a> by bump</figcaption></figure>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/six-misunderstandings-about-scholarly-markdown"/>
        <updated>2014-03-03T15:50:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I want to talk about some of the misunderstandings I frequently encounter when discussing <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">markdown as a format for authoring scholarly documents</a>.</p><h2 id="scholars-will-always-use-microsoft-word">Scholars will always use Microsoft Word</h2><p>Microsoft Word is of course what almost all authors use in the life sciences and many other disciplines. One big reason for this is the file formats accepted my manuscript submission systems. By limiting the options to Microsoft Word (and maybe LaTeX), you make it impossible for authors to use other tools, even if they wanted to. Publishers should accept manuscripts in any reasonable file format, as I have <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/the-grammar-of-scholarly-communication/">argued before</a>.</p><h2 id="my-markup-language-is-better-than-markdown">My markup language is better than markdown</h2><p>There are of course numerous alternatives to markdown, including <a href="http://txstyle.org/">Textile</a>, <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a>, <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting">MediaWiki Markup</a> and <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html">reStructuredText</a>. There will always be features that are better implemented in one of these languages, but I don’t think there is room for more than one major initiative for a scholarly markup language. And markdown has the right mix of features and broad support by tools and the community.</p><p>Related to this there is the argument against markdown that the format <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-future-of-markdown/">is a mess</a> and that there are too many versions (or flavors) of it. While that is certainly a big problem with markdown, I would argue that with <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> we have a nice standard and reference implementation for Scholarly Markdown. Pandoc is constantly evolving, and the addition of support for arbitrary YAML metadata was the biggest new feature in 2013 for me.</p><h2 id="scholarly-markdown-is-too-complex-and-we-might-as-well-use-latex">Scholarly Markdown is too complex and we might as well use LaTeX</h2><blockquote>LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. <br>The LaTeX Team, 2014</blockquote><p>Although LaTeX has solved many of the problems Scholarly Markdown tries to tackle a long time ago, it is still something else. LaTeX at its core is a typesetting system, which is not something Scholarly Markdown cares about for two reasons: a) the focus is on authoring documents, which are then submitted to other systems at publishers and elsewhere that are specialized in producing the final document, and b) the focus is on HTML and the web as this is where we want most of the interactions with scholarly documents to take place. This means that</p><ul><li>Markdown is a great input format to convert into other formats, including XML (see for example my <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats">pandoc-jats</a>).</li><li>LaTeX will always be the best choice for some content, e.g. documents rich in mathematical formulas</li><li>If the ultimate goal was to produce high-quality PDF documents, Scholarly Markdown would be a bad choice. It is the right format for HTML and the related ePub.</li></ul><p>We have to be very careful that we keep the right balance of simplicity and features in Scholarly Markdown. This means that sometimes we should just include the LaTeX code, e.g. for math.</p><h2 id="scientists-need-a-wysiwyg-editor-and-then-the-file-format-doesn-t-matter">Scientists need a WYSIWYG Editor, and then the file format doesn’t matter</h2><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> - What You See Is What You Get - is a user interface metaphor that is both a blessing and a curse. We desperately need better writing tools, and this of course also means user interfaces that help with that task. But the focus on creating a new authoring environment that focusses too much on WYSIWYG creates several problems:</p><ul><li>WYSIWYG is not always a good metaphor for scholarly documents. Typographic features such as fonts, line spacing, etc. are not something that belong into an authoring environment - this is done during the publishing step, as is the formatting of references according to a specific citation style.</li><li>WYSIWYG is for human interactions, but content in scholarly documents is increasingly created by computers. Two good examples are statistics and figures created in <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">R/knitr</a> or <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">iPython Notebook</a>. Scholarly Markdown works perfectly with these workflows.</li><li>WYSIWYG authoring environments run the high risk of vendor lock-in. This is understandable if you run a startup and want to promote your tool, but is not in the best interest of the scholarly community.</li></ul><p>Version control via git is central to Scholarly Markdown, and this can also be challenging for a WYSIWYG environment. But there are many good examples of how to make this work.</p><h2 id="scientists-should-submit-their-manuscripts-in-jats-xml-the-standard-format-for-scholarly-documents">Scientists should submit their manuscripts in JATS XML, the standard format for scholarly documents</h2><p>At the end of the day most scholarly publications in the life sciences are converted into JATS XML. Unfortunately central aspects of the format (e.g. the required document structure or required attributes) are difficult to enforce in an authoring environment. Even if you build a tool that can nicely handle this, I’m not so sure we want to burden an author with this, especially since the manuscript will usually undergo a lot of changes before it is accepted and then published.</p><h2 id="the-future-is-html">The future is HTML</h2><p>Although the future for consuming scholarly documents is clearly HTML (and ePub), and there are great HTML editors, I’m not so sure that HTML will become the default for authoring environments. This is the reason why markdown and related markup languages were invented, and even with modern WYSIWYG editors working directly with HTML is not always the best choice. HTML has two problems: a) it is not as human-readable as markdown and therefore requires an additional layer for authoring, and b) it is not as structured as XML, which makes it difficult to create some of the rigid document structure required for scholarly documents. O’Reilly is trying to get more structure into HTML for print and digital books with <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/htmlbook">HTMLBook</a>, but with too much structure you might run into similar problems for authoring as discussed above for JATS XML. And of course you can include HTML in markdown documents.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Journal Article Tag Suite (<a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/">JATS</a>) is a NISO standard that defines a set of XML elements and attributes for tagging journal articles. JATS is not only used for fulltext content at PubMed Central (and JATS has evolved from the NLM Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite originally developed for PubMed Central), but is also increasinly used by publishers.</p><p>For many publishers the <em>version of record</em> of an article is stored in XML, and other formats (currently HTML, PDF and increasingly ePub) are generated from this XML. Unfortunately the process of converting author-submitted manuscripts into JATS-compliant XML is time-consuming and costly, and this is a problem in particular for small publishers.</p><p>In a recent blog post (<a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/the-grammar-of-scholarly-communication/">The Grammar of Scholarly Communication</a>) I argued that publishers should accept manuscripts in any reasonable file format, including Microsoft Word, Open Office, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML and PDF. Readers of this blog know that I am a big fan of <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/tags.html#markdown-ref">markdown</a> for scholarly documents, but I am of course well aware that at the end of the day these documents have to be converted into JATS.</p><p>As a small step towards that goal I have today released the first public version of <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats">pandoc-jats</a>, a <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#custom-writers">custom writer for Pandoc</a> that converts markdown documents into JATS XML with a single command, e.g.</p><pre><code>pandoc -f example.md --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography=example.bib --csl=apa.csl -t JATS.lua -o example.xml</code></pre><p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats">pandoc-jats</a> Github repository for more detailed information, but using this custom writer is as simple as downloading a single <code>JATS.lua</code>file. The big challenge is of course to make this custom writer work with as many documents as possible, and that will be my job the next few weeks. Two example JATS documents are below (both markdown versions of scholarly articles and posted on this blog as HTML):</p><ul><li>Nine simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/nine-simple-ways-to-make-it-easier-to-reuse-your-data/">HTML</a>, <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/files/10.7287.peerj.preprints.7v2.xml">JATS</a>)</li><li>What Can Article Level Metrics Do for You? (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/what-can-article-level-metrics-do-for-you/">HTML</a>, <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/files/10.1371.journal.pbio.1001687.xml">JATS</a>)</li></ul><p>Both JATS files were validated against the JATS DTD and XSD and showed no errors with the NLM XML StyleChecker - using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/PeerJ/jats-conversion">jats-conversion</a> conversion and validation tools written by Alf Eaton. Markdown is actually a nice file format to convert to XML - in contrast to HTML authors can’t for example put closing tags at the wrong places. And a Pandoc custom writer written in the Lua scripting language is an interesting alternative to XSLT transformations, the more common way to create JATS XML. The custom writer has not been tested with other Pandoc input formats besides markdown, of particular interest are of course HTML and LaTeX - Microsoft Word .docx is unfortunately only a Pandoc output format.</p><p>This is the first public release and there is of course a lot of room for improvement. Many elements and attributes are not yet supported - although <a href="http://orcid.org/blog/2013/03/22/orcid-how-more-specifying-orcid-ids-document-metadata">ORCID author identifiers</a> are of course included. Please help me improve this tool using the Github <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats/issues">Issue Tracker</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In October I published an essay on Article-Level Metrics (ALM) in PLOS Biology (Fenner, 2013). The essay is a good introduction into Article-Level Metrics, and I am proud that it is part of the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/issue.pcol.v06.i03">Tenth Anniversary PLOS Biology Collection</a>. Like all PLOS content, the article was published with a <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/creative-commons-for-science-interview-with-puneet-kishor/">Creative Commons attribution license</a>, allowing me to republish the article on this blog. I have now done so and the article is available <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/12/11/what-can-article-level-metrics-do-for-you/">here</a>.</p><p>Of course I didn’t want to simply republish the article, but I wanted to publish an improved version. The article has five figures, four of them show visualizations of ALM data that were generated using R (the fifth figure is a table reproduced from another article). The PLOS article includes the ALM dataset and the R scripts used to generate the figures as <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.s001">supplementary information</a>. What I have done now is to recreate the article as a single markdown file (available <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/blog/blob/master/_posts/2013-12-11-what-can-article-level-metrics-do-for-you.Rmd">here</a>) that has all R code embedded. Using R and <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> - and the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/data/alm_report_plos_biology_2013-05-20.csv">CSV file with the ALM data</a> - everyone can now reproduce the figures from the paper by simply running the embedded code, and can dig deeper into the data.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/2013-12-11_figure_3.svg" class="kg-image" alt="Figure 3. Views vs. citations for PLOS Biology articles published in 2010." loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">Figure 3.</strong> Views vs.&nbsp;citations for PLOS Biology articles published in 2010.</figcaption></figure><p>This was a good opportunity to improve the accessibility of the article in other ways. Instead of the raster image formats PNG, JPEG and TIFF used by PLOS and almost every other publisher, I generated the figures in the vector format SVG. Not only does SVG produce images independent of device resolution and screen size (try to zoom in on the figure above), but SVG can also easily be manipulated in the browser since it is XML. This is beyond the scope of this blog post, but look at the <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> Javascript library for great examples of how SVG can be dynamically generated and changed in the browser. <strong><strong>Figure 3</strong></strong> above could for example be enhanced so that the article title is displayed when you hover over one of the bubbles, or we could enable zooming to show more detail.</p><p>Like all content on this blog, the article was created using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, and the bibliography was dynamically generated. This makes it easy to change the citation style, and I decided to use the <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA Style</a> that shows the citations in the text as author-date rather than numbered as with the PLOS style (see the example citation in the first paragraph). The combined bibliography for all blog posts including the article can be downloaded in bibtex format <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/bibliography/references.bib">here</a>.</p><p>Lastly, I wanted to generate nicer HTML for a better online reading experience. I haven’t done anything fancy, but most publishers seem to focus on navigation around an article, so that very little screen real estate is left for the actual content of the article. I’ve tried to improve readability by reducing the navigation areas to a minimum, by using readable fonts in larger sizes: <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/minion-pro">Adobe Minion Pro</a> for the body text and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/myriad-pro">Adobe Myriad Pro</a> for headings, tables and figure legends.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Fenner, M.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Article-level metrics (ALMs) provide a wide range of metrics about the uptake of an individual journal article by the scientific community after publication. They include citations, usage statistics, discussions in online comments and social media, social bookmarking, and recommendations. In this essay, we describe why article-level metrics are an important extension of traditional citation-based journal metrics and provide a number of example from ALM data collected for PLOS Biology.</em></p><p><em>This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, authored by me and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">originally published Oct 22, 2013 in PLOS Biology</a>.</em></p><p>The scientific impact of a particular piece of research is reflected in how this work is taken up by the scientific community. The first systematic approach that was used to assess impact, based on the technology available at the time, was to track citations and aggregate them by journal. This strategy is not only no longer necessary â€” since now we can easily track citations for individual articles â€” but also, and more importantly, journal-based metrics are now considered a poor performance measure for individual articles (Campbell, 2008; Glänzel &amp; Wouters, 2013). One major problem with journal-based metrics is the variation in citations per article, which means that a small percentage of articles can skew, and are responsible for, the majority of the journal-based citation impact factor, as shown by Campbell (2008) for the 2004 <em>Nature</em> Journal Impact Factor. <strong><strong>Figure 1</strong></strong> further illustrates this point, showing the wide distribution of citation counts between <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles published in 2010. <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles published in 2010 have been cited a median 19 times to date in Scopus, but 10% of them have been cited 50 or more times, and two articles (Dickson, Wang, Krantz, Hakonarson, &amp; Goldstein, 2010; Narendra et al., 2010) more than 300 times. <em>PLOS Biology</em> metrics are used as examples throughout this essay, and the dataset is available in the supporting information (<strong><strong>Data S1</strong></strong>). Similar data are available for an increasing number of other publications and organizations.</p><pre><code># code for figure 1: density plots for citation counts for PLOS Biology

Median 19 citations; 10% of papers have at least 50 citations.</figcaption></figure><p>Scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator (Bollen, Sompel, Hagberg, &amp; Chute, 2009; Glänzel &amp; Wouters, 2013; Schekman &amp; Patterson, 2013). To this end, PLOS has collected and displayed a variety of metrics for all its articles since 2009. The array of different categorised article-level metrics (ALMs) used and provided by PLOS as of August 2013 are shown in <strong><strong>Figure 2</strong></strong>. In addition to citations and usage statistics, i.e., how often an article has been viewed and downloaded, PLOS also collects metrics about: how often an article has been saved in online reference managers, such as Mendeley; how often an article has been discussed in its comments section online, and also in science blogs or in social media; and how often an article has been recommended by other scientists. These additional metrics provide valuable information that we would miss if we only consider citations. Two important shortcomings of citation-based metrics are that (1) they take years to accumulate and (2) citation analysis is not always the best indicator of impact in more practical fields, such as clinical medicine (Eck, Waltman, Raan, Klautz, &amp; Peul, 2013). Usage statistics often better reflect the impact of work in more practical fields, and they also sometimes better highlight articles of general interest (for example, the 2006 <em>PLOS Biology</em> article on the citation advantage of Open Access articles (Eysenbach, 2006), one of the 10 most-viewed articles published in <em>PLOS Biology</em>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/2013-12-11_figure_2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Figure 2.

The weekly <em>PLOS Biology</em> publication schedule is reflected in this figure, with articles published on the same day present in a vertical line. <strong><strong>Figure 3</strong></strong> also shows that the two most highly cited 2010 <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles are also among the most viewed (indicated by the red arrows), but overall there isn’t a strong correlation between citations and views. The most-viewed article published in 2010 in <em>PLOS Biology</em> is an essay on Darwinian selection in robots (Floreano &amp; Keller, 2010). Detailed usage statistics also allow speculatulation about the different ways that readers access and make use of published literature; some articles are browsed or read online due to general interest while others that are downloaded (and perhaps also printed) may reflect the reader’s intention to look at the data and results in detail and to return to the article more than once.</p><pre><code># code for figure 3: Bubblechart views vs. citations for PLOS Biology

By contrast, a citation may be one of the last outcomes of their interest, occuring only about 1 in 300 times a PLOS paper is viewed online. A lot of things happen in between these potential responses, ranging from discussions in comments, social media, and blogs, to bookmarking, to linking from websites. These activities are usually subsumed under the term â€œaltmetrics,â€ and their variety can be overwhelming. Therefore, it helps to group them together into categories, and several organizations, including PLOS, are using the category labels of Viewed, Cited, Saved, Discussed, and Recommended (<strong><strong>Figures 2 and 4</strong></strong>, see also (Lin &amp; Fenner, 2013)).</p><pre><code># code for figure 4: bar plot for Article-level metrics for PLOS Biology

Proportion of all 1,706 <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles published up to May 20, 2013 mentioned by particular article-level metrics source. Colors indicate categories (Viewed, Cited, Saved, Discussed, Recommended), as used on the PLOS website.</figcaption></figure><p>All <em>PLOS Biology</em> articles are viewed and downloaded, and almost all of them (all research articles and nearly all front matter) will be cited sooner or later. Almost all of them will also be bookmarked in online reference managers, such as Mendeley, but the percentage of articles that are discussed online is much smaller. Some of these percentages are time dependent; the use of social media discussion platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook for example, has increased in recent years (93% of <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles published since June 2012 have been discussed on Twitter, and 63% mentioned on Facebook). These are the locations where most of the online discussion around published articles currently seems to take place; the percentage of papers with comments on the PLOS website or that have science blog posts written about them is much smaller. Not all of this online discussion is about research articles, and perhaps, not surprisingly, the most-tweeted PLOS article overall (with more than 1,100 tweets) is a <em>PLOS Biology</em> perspective on the use of social media for scientists (Bik &amp; Goldstein, 2013).</p><p>Some metrics are not so much indicators of a broad online discussion, but rather focus on highlighting articles of particular interest. For example, science blogs allow a more detailed discussion of an article as compared to comments or tweets, and journals themselves sometimes choose to highlight a paper on their own blogs, allowing for a more digestible explanation of the science for the non-expert reader (Fausto et al., 2012). Coverage by other bloggers also serves the same purpose; a good example of this is one recent post on the OpenHelix Blog (“Video Tip of the Week: Turkeys and their genomes,” 2012) that contains video footage of the second author of a 2010 <em>PLOS Biology</em> article (Dalloul et al., 2010) discussing the turkey genome.</p><p>F1000Prime, a commercial service of recommendations by expert scientists, was added to the PLOS Article-Level Metrics in August 2013. We now highlight on the PLOS website when any articles have received at least one recommendation within F1000Prime. We also monitor when an article has been cited within the widely used modern-day online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A good example of the latter is the Tasmanian devil Wikipedia page (“Tasmanian devil,” 2013) that links to a <em>PLOS Biology</em> research article published in 2010 (Nilsson et al., 2010). While a F1000Prime recommendation is a strong endorsement from peer(s) in the scientific community, being included in a Wikipedia page is akin to making it into a textbook about the subject area and being read by a much wider audience that goes beyond the scientific community.</p><p><em>PLOS Biology</em> is the PLOS journal with the highest percentage of articles recommended in F1000Prime and mentioned in Wikipedia, but there is only partial overlap between the two groups of articles because they focus on different audiences (<strong><strong>Figure 5</strong></strong>). These recommendations and mentions in turn show correlations with other metrics, but not simple ones; you can’t assume, for example, that highly cited articles are more likely to be recommended by F1000Prime, so it will be interesting to monitor these trends now that we include this information.</p><pre><code># code for figure 5: Venn diagram F1000 vs. Wikipedia for PLOS Biology

A good first step for researchers, research administrators, and others interested in looking at the metrics of a larger set of PLOS articles is the recently launched ALM Reports tool (“ALM Reports,” 2013). There are also a growing number of service providers, including <a href="http://altmetric.com/" rel="nofollow">Altmetric.com</a> (“<a href="http://altmetric.com/" rel="nofollow">Altmetric.com</a>,” 2013), ImpactStory (“ImpactStory,” 2013), and Plum Analytics (“Plum Analytics,” 2013) that provide similar services for articles from other publishers.</p><p>As article-level metrics become increasingly used by publishers, funders, universities, and researchers, one of the major challenges to overcome is ensuring that standards and best practices are widely adopted and understood. The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) was recently awarded a grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to work on this (“NISO Alternative Assessment Metrics (Altmetrics) Project,” 2013), and PLOS is actively involved in this project. We look forward to further developing our article-level metrics and to having them adopted by other publishers, which hopefully will pave the way to their wide incorporation into research and researcher assessments.</p><h3 id="supporting-information">Supporting Information</h3><p><strong><strong><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.s001">Data S1</a>.

In contrast to Hadley we stored the individual chapters as Jekyll posts rather than pages, as this better integrates with other Jekyll functionality, e.g. tags.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Authoring of scholarly articles is a recurring theme in this blog since it started in 2008. Authoring is still in desperate need for improvement, and nobody has convincingly figured out how to solve this problem. Authoring involves several steps, and it helps to think about them separately:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Writing</strong></strong>. Manuscript writing, including formatting, collaborative authoring</li><li><strong><strong>Submission</strong></strong>. Formatting a manuscript according to a publisher’s author guidelines, and handing it over to a publishing platform</li><li><strong><strong>Revision</strong></strong>. Changes made to a manuscript in the peer review process, or after publication</li></ul><p>Although authoring typically involves text, similar issues arise for other research outputs, e.g research data. And these considerations are also relevant for other forms of publishing, whether it is self-publication on a blog or website, or publishing of preprints and white papers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/1278021067_0bf5c8aa82_c.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Flickr photo by citnaj." loading="lazy" width="800" height="595"><figcaption>Flickr photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/citnaj/1278021067/" style="box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent; color: rgb(52, 152, 219); text-decoration: none;">citnaj</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>For me the main challenge in authoring is to go from human-readable unstructured content to highly structured machine-readable content. We could make authoring simpler by either forgoing any structure and just publishing in any format we want, or we can force authors to structure their manuscripts according to a very specific set of rules. The former doesn’t seem to be an option, not only do we have a set of community standards that have evolved for a very long time (research articles for example have title, authors, results, references, etc.), but it also makes it hard to find and reuse scholarly research by others.</p><p>The latter option is also not really viable since most researchers haven’t learned to produce their research outputs in machine-readable highly standardized formats. There are some exceptions, e.g. <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</a> and other reporting standards in clinical medicine or the <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/23/brian-mcmahon-publishing-semantic-crystallography-every-science-data-publisher-should-watch-this-all-the-way-through/">semantic publishing in Crystallography</a>, but for the most part research outputs are too diverse to easily find a format that works for all of them. The current trend is certainly towards machine-readable rather than towards human-readable, but there is still a significant gap - scholarly articles are transformed from documents in Microsoft Word (or sometimes LaTeX) format into XML (for most biomedical research that means <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">JATS</a>) using kludgy tools and lots of manual labor.</p><p>What solutions have been tried to overcome the limitations of our current authoring tools, and to make the process more enjoyable for authors and more productive for publishers?</p><ol><li>Do the conversion manually, still a common workflow.</li><li>Tools for publishers such as <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/05/01/extyles_interview_with_elizabeth_blake_and_bruce_rosenblum/">eXtyles</a>, <a href="http://www.shabash.net/merops/">Merops</a> - both commercial - or the evolving Open Source <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/mpach/modules">mPach</a> that convert Microsoft Word documents into JATS XML and do a lot of automated checks along the way.</li><li>Tools for authors that directly generate JATS XML, either as a Microsoft Word plugin (the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview-with-pablo-fernicola">Article Authoring Add-In</a>, not actively maintained) in the browser (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/27/lemon8_xml_interview_with_mj_suhonos/">Lemon8-XML</a>, not actively maintained), or directly in a publishing platform such as Wordpress (<a href="http://annotum.org/">Annotum</a>).</li><li>Forget about XML and use HTML5 has the canonical file format, e.g. as <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/">Scholarly HTML</a> or HTML5 specifications such as <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/blob/master/specification.asciidoc">HTMLBook</a>. Please read Molly Sharp’s <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/structured-documents-for-science-jats-xml-as-canonical-content-format/">blog post</a> for background information about HTML as an alternative to XML.</li><li>Use file formats for authoring that are a better fit for the requirements of scholarly authors, in particular <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">Scholarly Markdown</a>.</li><li>Build online editors for scientific content that hide the underlying file format, and guide users towards a structured format, e.g. by not allowing input that doesn’t conform to specifications.</li></ol><p><strong><strong>Solution 1.</strong></strong> isn’t really an option, as it makes scholarly publishing unnecessarily slow and expensive. Typesetter Kaveh Bazergan has gone on record at the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-a-global-conference/">SpotOn London Conference 2012</a> by saying that the current process is insane and that he wants to be “put out of business”.</p><p><strong><strong>Solution 2.</strong></strong> is probably the most commonly used workflow used by larger publishers today, but is very much centered around a Microsoft Word to XML workflow. LaTeX is a popular authoring environment in some disciplines, but still requires work to convert documents into web-friendly formats such as HTML and XML.</p><p><strong><strong>Solutions 3. to 5.</strong></strong> have never picked up any significant traction. Overall the progress in this area has been modest at best, and the mainstream of authoring today isn’t too different from 20 years ago. Although I have gone on record for saying that <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/tags.html#markdown-ref">Scholarly Markdown</a> has a lot of potential, the problem is much bigger than finding a single file format, and markdown will never be the solution for all authoring needs.</p><p><strong><strong>Solution 6.</strong></strong> is an area where a lot of exciting development is currently happening, examples include <a href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</a>, <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/">WriteLateX</a>, <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</a>. Although the future of scholarly authoring will certainly include online authoring tools (making it much easier to collaborate, one of the authoring pain points), we run the risk of locking in users into one particular authoring environment.</p><h3 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h3><p>How can we move forward? I would suggest the following:</p><ol><li>Publishers should accept manuscripts in any reasonable file format, which means at least Microsoft Word, Open Office, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML and PDF, but possibly more. This will create a lot of extra work for publishers, but will open the doors for innovation, both in the academic and commercial sector. We will never see significant progress in scholarly authoring tools if the submission step requires manuscripts to be in a single file format (Microsoft Word) - in particular since this file format is a general purpose word processsing format and not something designed specifically for scholarly content. And we want researchers to spend their time doing research and writing up their research, not formatting documents.</li><li>To handle this avalanche of unstructured documents, publishers need conversion tools that can transform all these documents into a format that can feed into their editorial and publishing workflows. A limited number of these tools exist already, but this will require a significant development effort. Again, opening up submissions to a variety of file formats will not only foster innovation in authoring tools, but also in document conversion tools.</li><li>We should think beyond XML. Many of the workflows designed today center around conversions from one XML format to another, e.g. Microsoft Word to JATS or <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> (popular in the humanities), often using XLST transforms. Not only is XML difficult for humans to read or edit, but the web and many of the technologies built around it are moving away from XML towards HTML5 and JSON. XML is fine as an important output format for publishing, but maybe not the best format to hold everything together.</li><li>As we haven’t come up with a canonical file format for scholarly documents by now, we should give up that idea. XML is great for publisher workflows, but is not something humans can easily edit or read. PDF is still the most widely read format by humans, but is not a good intermediary format. LaTeX is too complex for authors outside of mathematics, physics and related fields, and is not built with web standards in mind. Markdown is promising, but doesn’t easily support highly structured content. And HTML5 and the related ePub are widely popular, but can be hard to edit without a visual editor, and currently don’t include enough standard metadata to support scholarly content out of the box.</li><li>The focus should not be on canonical file formats for scholarly documents, but on tools that understand the manuscripts created by researchers and can transform them into something more structured. As we have learned from document conversion tools such as <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, we can’t do this with a simple find and replace using regular expressions, but need a more structured approach. Pandoc is taking the input document (markdown, LaTeX or HTML) apart and is constructing an abstract syntax tree (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>) of the document, using parsing expression grammar (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">PEG</a>), which includes a set of parsing rules. Parsing expression grammars are fairly new, <a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/peg">first described by Bryan Ford</a> about 10 years ago, but in my mind are a very good fit for the formal grammar of scientific documents. It should be fairly straightforward to generate a variety of output formats from the AST (Pandoc can convert into more than 30 document formats), the hard part is the parsing of the input.</li></ol><p>All this requires a lot of work. Pandoc is a good model to start, but is written in Haskell, a functional programming language that not many people are familar with. For small changes Pandoc allows you to directly manipulate the AST (represented as JSON) using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html">filters</a> written in Haskell or Python. And <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">custom writers</a> for other document formats can be written using <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, another interesting programming language that not many people know about. Lua is a fast and relatively easy to learn scripting language that can be easily embedded into other languages, and for similar reasons is also used to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua">extend the functionality of Wikipedia</a>. PEG parsers in other languages include <a href="http://treetop.rubyforge.org/">Treetop</a> (Ruby), <a href="http://pegjs.majda.cz/">PEG.js</a> (Javascript), and <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>, a popular parser generator that also includes PEG features.</p><p>But I think the effort to build a solid open source conversion tool for scholarly documents is worth it, in particular for smaller publishers and publishing platforms who can’t afford the commercial Microsoft Word to JATS conversion tools. We shouldn’t take any shortcuts - e.g. by focussing on XML and XLST transforms - and we can improve this tool over time, e.g. by starting with a few input and output formats. This tool will be valuable beyond authoring, as it can also be very helpful to convert published scholarly content into other formats such as ePub, and in text mining, which in many ways tries to solve many of the same problems. The <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html">Pandoc documentation</a> includes an example of extracting all URLs out of a document, and this can be modified to extract other content. In case you wonder whether I gave up on the idea of <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/tags.html#markdown-ref">Scholarly Markdown</a> - not at all. To me this is a logical next step, opening up journal submission systems to Scholarly Markdown and other evolving file formats. And Pandoc, one of the most interesting tools in this space, is a markdown conversion tool at its heart. The next steps could be the following:</p><ul><li>write a custom writer in Lua that generates JATS output from Pandoc</li><li>explore how difficult it would be to add Microsoft Word .docx as Pandoc input format</li><li>develop Pandoc filters relevant for scholarly documents (e.g. <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">auto-linking accession numbers of biomedical databases</a>)</li></ul><hr>]]></content>

I had a great time with many interesting sessions and good conversations both in and between sessions. But I might be biased, since I helped organize the event, and in particular did help put the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/?cat=11">sessions for the Tools strand</a> together.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/10739125344_fb8533423a_o.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SpotOn London name tags.

I was one of the panelists and had summarized my ideas prior to the session in a <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/evaluating-impact-whats-your-number/">blog post</a> written together with Jennifer Lin. It was an interesting session, although a bit too controversial for my taste. But it became obvious to me in this and a few other sessions that other obsession with quantitative assessment of science is increasingly dangerous. Other people have said this more eloquently:</p><ul><li>The mania for measurement - Stephen Curry in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-whats-your-number-altmetrics-session/">#solo13alt</a> session</li><li>Why research assessment is out of control - <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/04/peter-scott-research-excellence-framework">Peter Scott</a></li><li>Universities are becoming metrics factories, driven by large corporates - <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2013/11/10/spoton2013-yet-another-wonderful-meeting/">Peter Murray-Rust</a></li><li>The ‘real’ revolution in science will come when the scientific egosystem gets rid of the credit-imperative - <a href="https://twitter.com/Villavelius/status/399157271793762304">Jan Velterop</a></li><li>Excellence by Nonsense: The Competition for Publications in Modern Science - <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/basics_background/excellence_by_nonsense/">Mathias Binswanger</a></li></ul><p>My job title is <em>Technical Lead Article-Level Metrics</em> so it might sound surprising that I say this. But we have to differentiate of what we do now and in the next few years - which is mainly to get away from the Journal Impact Factor to more reasonable metrics that look at individual articles and include other metrics besides citations - to where we want to be in 10 or more years. And for the latter it is essential that journal articles and other research outputs are valued for the research they contain, rather than serving as a currency for <em>merit</em> that can be exchanged into grants and acadmic advancement. This is a very difficult problem to solve and I have no answers yet. Going back to how science was conducted until about 50 years ago - as a small elite club that worked based on closed personal networks - is definitely not the answer.</p><h2 id="reason-2">Reason #2</h2><p>In <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-keynote-1-boson-50-years-50003-scientists-understanding-our-universe-through-global-scientific-collaboration-and-open-access/">his keynote</a> Salvatore Mele from CERN explained to us that Open Access in High Energy Phsics is 50 years old, and that the culture of sharing preprints preceeded the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> e-prints service - scientists were mailing their manuscripts to each other at least 20 years before ArXiV launched in 1991. A similar culture doesn’t exist in the life sciences and therefore the preprint services for biologists launched this year (e.g. <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/">PeerJ Preprints</a> and <a href="http://biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a>) will have a hard time gaining traction.</p><p>Email is one of those services that every researcher uses, and we should think much more about how we can create innovative services around email rather than only considering new tools and services that are still used only by early adopters. AJ Cann had coordinated a workshop around email at SpotOn London that he called <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-the-dark-art-of-dark-social-email-the-antisocial-medium-which-will-not-die-workshop/">the dark art of dark social: email, the antisocial medium that will not die</a>. I am still puzzled why most researchers prefer to receive tables of content by email rather than as a RSS feed, but we shouldn’t confuse what we get excited about as software developers and early adopters of online tools with what the mainstream scientist would be likely to use.</p><p>Another good example is <a href="http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/">data sharing</a>, a topic that was discussed in at least three SpotOn sessions. Even though most attendees at SpotOn London agreed that sharing of research data is important, it is obvious that this is currently not common practice in most scientific disciplines. Funders have created data sharing policies (e.g. <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">NSF</a> or the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Data-sharing/">Wellcome Trust</a>), as <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067111">have publishers</a>, and many organizations are thinking about incentives for data sharing, including data journals such as <a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/">Scientific Data</a> that will launch in 2014 and was presented by Ruth Wilson in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-can-we-encourage-data-sharing-discussion/">motivations for data sharing</a> session. Even though incentives can help promote changes, I am pessimistic that something as central to the conduct of science as data sharing can be changed without more scientists being intrinsically motivated to do so. This is a much slower process that should start as early as possible during training, as pointed out by Kaitlin Thaney in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-can-we-encourage-data-sharing-discussion/">#solo13carrot</a> session.</p><h2 id="reason-3">Reason #3</h2><p>In terms of the technology that is holding us back, I increasingly think that publisher manuscript submission systems may be the single most important place that is slowing down innovation. I participated in the first <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop in 2011, and I think now that <strong><strong>Beyond the MTS (or manuscript tracking system)</strong></strong> might have been a better motto than <strong><strong>Beyond the PDF</strong></strong>, as many of the problems we discussed relate to typical editorial workflows we use today. These systems need to implement many of the ideas discussed at SpotOn London and other places, from opening up peer review (<a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-should-peer-review-evolve/">#solo13peer</a>) to making it easier to integrate research data into manuscripts (<a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-should-peer-review-evolve/">#solo13carrot</a>) and to ideas of how the scientific record should like in the digital age (<a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-what-should-the-scientific-record-look-like-in-the-digital-age-discussion/">#solo13digital</a>). In the latter panel we discussed both new authoring tools such as <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/">WriteLaTeX</a>, and new ideas of what a research object should look like and how the different parts are linked to each other. A major theme here was reproducibility highlighted both by Carol Goble (also see her <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/carolegoble/ismb2013-keynotecleangoble">ISMB/ECCB 2013 Keynote</a>) and Peter Kraker (see also his <a href="http://science.okfn.org/2013/10/18/its-not-only-peer-reviewed-its-reproducible/">Open Knowledge Foundation blog post</a>).</p><p>The problem with today’s manuscript submission systems is that they have grown so big and complex that any change is slow and cumbersome, rather than iterative and part of an ongoing dialogue. I don’t want to blame any single vendor of these systems, but rather suggest that we carefully re-evaluate the workflow from the manuscript written by one or more authors to the accepted manuscript. My personal interest is mainly in authoring tools, and I have recently written about and experimented with <a href="http://localhost:4000/tags.html#markdown-ref">Markdown</a>. This process of re-evaluating manuscript tracking systems is not simply about technology, but is rather about how we approach this problem as author, publisher, tool vendor and as a community.</p>]]></content>

There is a continuum towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> format, although I don’t like to drift too much from <em>doing</em> to <em>talking</em>. A good example of a workshop open to everyone and not just software developers is the SpotOn London workshop this Saturday on <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-wikipedia-editing-workshop/">Wikipedia Editing</a> run by Brian Kelly and Toni Sant.</li><li>Meet before and after the hackathon. This can be done online, but it helps to focus on what can be achieved in the limited time available for a hackathon, and to follow up on projects that have just been started. But a hackathon is also a great opportunity to meet new people and new ideas, so meeting afterwards is more important than before.</li><li>Involve remote people. A lot of the fun of hackdays comes from sitting around a table and doing something together. But sometimes this is not possible for everyone, so think about remote participation where it makes sense.</li></ul>]]></content>

        <updated>2013-10-25T16:21:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it is fair to say that commenting on scientific papers is broken. And with commenting I mean online comments that are publicly available, not informal discussions in journal clubs or at meetings. This definition would include discussions of papers on social media such as Twitter or Facebook. Why do I think that commenting is broken?</p><ul><li>the number of papers with online comments is low. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">For PLOS Biology</a> we have comments on the journal platform for 11% of articles, tweets for 14% of articles and Facebook activity for 22% of articles. The numbers for Twitter and Facebook are much higher for more recently published articles, but are nowhere close to every article having at least one comment.</li><li>even though there is a fair amount of social media activity around articles, the quality of the discussion is varied. Twitter for example seems to work mostly as an alerting service for interesting articles with little more than the title of the article in the tweet text and not much discussion.</li><li>when comments are made, they are really hard to find coming from the article. Unless they are made on the journal platform, or the publisher tracks article-level metrics and links out to these comments.</li></ul><p>What can be done to address these issues, i.e. increase the number of comments, increase the depth of the discussion, and make it easier to link comments to articles? Some of the thoughts that I and others have had include the following:</p><ul><li>lower the technical barriers for commenting by providing a common and familiar commenting platform with an attractive user interface. Many blogs (including this one) and <a href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/">some publishers</a> use Disqus, which is arguably the most popular third-party commenting platform.</li><li>develop new features that make commenting more attractive, including comments linked to specific sections of the text and notes that can be public, semi-public or private. See for example <a href="https://medium.com/about/5972c72b18f2">what Medium is doing</a>, check out <a href="http://hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a> and <a href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/62886292466/peerj-questions-a-new-way-to-never-publish-forget">PeerJ Questions</a>, or study what services such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> are doing.</li><li>Link comments made in different places about the same object together, e.g. through Article-Level Metrics services.</li><li>create incentives for scientists to comment, e.g. through <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Mozilla Open Badges</a> or by making them part of a community.</li></ul><p>On Tuesday the US National Library of Medicine launched <a href="http://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2013/10/22/pubmed-commons-a-new-forum-for-scientific-discourse/">PubMed Commons</a> as a <em>New Forum for Scientific Discourse</em>:</p><blockquote>We hope that PubMed Commons will leverage the social power of the internet to encourage constructive criticism and high quality discussions of scientific issues that will both enhance understanding and provide new avenues of collaboration within the community.</blockquote><p>PubMed Commons is still a pilot project and in order to read or write comments you have to be a PubMed Commons participant and be signed in with your My NCBI account. PubMed Commons has some important features:</p><ul><li>PubMed is probably the place where most life sciences researchers search for literature. Having comments and discussion there makes perfect sense, and is probably a better place than a publisher platform that only targets particular journals. PubMed also has a reputation that is very different from social media tools that are popular, but not really familiar to most scientists.</li><li>Access to PubMed Commons is restricted to researchers, and this is one strategy to have the comments focus on scientific discourse. It has to be seen whether the process of registering for PubMed Commons (which currently is a bit more involved than most commenting systems) is a barrier for scientists to take part in the discussion, or whether it generates an audience that makes it more likely that scientists contribute.</li><li>For people signing in with their My NCBI account (I don’t know the percentage of PubMed users that do that on a regular basis), commenting is really easy and the interface is straightforward. The comment editor uses markdown, which makes it easy to format comments and to include links.</li></ul><p><em>10/26/13: added link to the recently launched <a href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/62886292466/peerj-questions-a-new-way-to-never-publish-forget">PeerJ Questions</a> which uses a question and answer format (thanks to Jason Hoyt for reminding me).</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday PLOS Biology published an essay by me: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">What Can Article Level Metrics Do for You?</a> (Fenner, 2013). I had help from many others in writing the essay, in particular PLOS Biology editor Emma Ganley. I hope that the essay can help researchers get introduced to article-level metrics, and I am honored that the essay is part of the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001688">PLOS Biology 10th anniversary collection</a>.</p><p>The essay is an Open Access article published under a CC-BY license, so not only can everyone read it, but the text and figures can be freely reused, as long as proper attribution is provided, e.g. Fig. 5:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/venndiagram_plos_biology.png" class="kg-image" alt="PLOS Biology articles: sites of recommendation and discussion.

As I <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/10/20/the-complete-article/">have said earlier</a>, I think it is important that an article contains more than the text. With the open source software <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> or <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> everyone can recreate the figures, and can look at the data underlying the figures in the essay. One can for example look into the data behind Fig. 5 to better understand how articles with F1000Prime recommendations <strong><strong>and</strong></strong> Wikipedia mentions differ from those <strong><strong>only</strong></strong> recommended in F1000Prime. Feel free to ask for help getting started in the comments.</p><p>Incidentally this is also my first PLOS article (my wife is way ahead of me with 5 research articles), so that I can finally look at PLOS article-level metrics as an author - after being the technical lead for this project since May 2012.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Fenner, M.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open access to research data is becoming increasingly important, as manifested by memos or press releases from the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTX035043.htm">Wellcome Trust</a>, the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-790_en.htm">European Commission</a>, and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research">the Office of Science and Technology Policy</a> (OSTP) from the White House.</p><p>Open access to research data is important as this makes it easier for other researchers to reproduce the research, and to build upon the research by others by re-analysis of data or combination with other research data. In other words, <a href="http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/">Science as an open enterprise</a>.</p><p>The major challenge to open access to research data is that data sharing is not a widespread practice. Several strategies have been developed to create incentives for researchers to share research data, including services that make it easier to share research data (e.g. <a href="http://figshare.com/">figshare</a>, <a href="http://dataup.cdlib.org/">DataUp</a> and <a href="http://www.zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>), <a href="http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=586">metrics for research data</a>, and data journals such as <a href="http://www.earth-system-science-data.net/">Earth System Science Data</a>, <a href="http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/">GigaScience</a> or the <a href="http://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/">Journal of open archaeology data</a>. Some of the sticks that have been tried in addition to the carrots above include data management plan requirements such as those <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">set forth by the National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> in 2011.</p><p>I would argue that all these carrots and sticks will eventually fall short, unless we redefine what the journal article (and similarly monograph) in the digital age should be about. Research data should become a required part of any research article, rather than an optional afterthought, or taking on a life on their own in a separate data journal.</p><p>The <em>complete article</em> - as I would like to call this journal article made fit for the digital age - should not only include the research data used to create figures and tables and reportes as results. Equally important are descriptions of reagents, workflows and software tools that go into much more detail compared to what is common practice today.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/complete_paper.png" class="kg-image" alt="Ingredients of the complete article" loading="lazy" width="567" height="495"><figcaption><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">Ingredients of the complete article</strong></figcaption></figure><p>The <em>complete article</em> does not have to come as one big file. More likely the research data will be hosted at one or more data centers elsewhere. Authorship will turn into contributorship and will include all roles required to put the <em>complete article</em> together, including for example data collection and -analysis, and writing software needed to analyze the data. The <em>complete article</em> can be shorter or longer than the typical article today, important is not article length, but the combination of text, data, and description of reagents and analysis tools.</p><p>The <em>complete article</em> should also include (or link to) the text of the peer reviews and previous article versions, including preprints. This makes it much easier to understand the article (and the data) in context. The <em>complete article</em> should also link to article-level metrics post-publication for similar reasons.</p><p>This idea of a <em>complete article</em> is not too far away from the best practices used today, but it is important to make it the default for scientific publication. Too much of what we publish today is still centered around the concept of what can be printed on paper, and telling exciting stories that have impact counts more than telling complete stories that can be reproduced.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2013-10-13T16:29:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we created a set of roughly 10,000 DOIs for journal articles published in 2011 or 2012. We used these DOIs as a reference set in a <a href="http://almdatachallenge.eventbrite.com/">data hackathon</a> around article-level metrics/altmetrics - material for another blog post.</p><p>The random DOis were generated using the <a href="http://random.labs.crossref.org/">CrossRef RanDOIm service</a>, with article titles fetched from the <a href="http://labs.crossref.org/openurl/">CrossRef OpenURL API</a>. We didn’t have time to properly parse the publication date and only used the publication year. We used the <code>crossref_r</code> and <code>crossref</code> functions from the rOpenSci <a href="http://ropensci.github.io/rplos/">rplos package</a> (and some extra help from Scott Chamberlain) to achieve this, the datasets were deposited to figshare and can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.821209">here</a> (2011) and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.821213">here</a> (2012).</p><p>The basic idea behind DOI names is summarized well in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">Wikipedia entry</a>:</p><blockquote>A digital object identifier (DOI) is a character string (a “digital identifier”) used to uniquely identify an object such as an electronic document. Metadata about the object is stored in association with the DOI name and this metadata may include a location, such as a URL, where the object can be found. The DOI for a document is permanent, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI provides more stable linking than simply referring to it by its URL, because if its URL changes, the publisher need only update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.</blockquote><p>DOIs for journal articles should provide users with a URL specific for that journal article. This URL could point to a digital copy of the journal article in HTML or PDF format, or could point to a landing page (with an abstract or other basic metadata) for journal articles that require a subscription. This should work not only for humans using a web browser, but also for automated services using command line tools such as <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> as scientific infrastructure depends heavily on automation and computers talking to each other. In our use case we want to find content linking to a specific article, and as some services (e.g. social media) will use the URL and not DOI of an article, we need to find out that URL.</p><p>Unfortunately it was difficult to find a URL for many DOIs in our reference set using automated tools. All these DOIs resolve to URLs for human users using a web browser, but for automated tools there are a number of challenges:</p><h3 id="requiring-a-cookie">Requiring a cookie</h3><p>Some publishers require a cookie, and that can cause problems for automated tools. We can use the popular command line tool <code>curl</code> with the options <code>-L</code> to follow redirects and <code>-I</code> to only send the header (as we care about the location and not the content of the page).</p><pre><code>curl -I -L "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2010.531020"</code></pre><p>This command will lead us not to a page specific for that article, but to a “Cookie absent” page. You can work around this by having curl accept cookies:</p><pre><code>curl -I -L --cookie "tmp" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2010.531020"</code></pre><p>Unfortunately not all tools do this. The way Facebook tracks likes, shares, comments, etc. is a prominent example.</p><h3 id="too-many-redirects">Too many redirects</h3><p>Some DOIs never resolve using a HEAD request, and curl stops after 50 redirects:</p><pre><code>curl -I -L "http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0b013e318235e525"</code></pre><p>This error may relate to the “requiring a cookie” error above.</p><h3 id="method-not-allowed">Method not allowed</h3><p>Some DOis HEAD requests result in a “405 Method Not Allowed” error. The reason is that the journal platform doesn’t accept the HEAD request, but wants a GET instead.</p><pre><code>curl -I -L "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sam.10120"</code></pre><p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">HTTP 1.1 protocol</a> says about HEAD:</p><blockquote>The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. … This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.</blockquote><p>We can work around this error by using a GET request, which unfortunately creates extra overhead and is not the recommended way to obtain this kind of information.</p><h3 id="empty-reply-from-server">Empty reply from server</h3><p>Some DOIs never resolve using a HEAD because curl reports “Empty reply from server” and we don’t get a HTTP 200 status code.</p><pre><code>curl -I -L "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.012"</code></pre><p>You can again work around this by using the location information before the last redirect, but maybe resolving a DOI should not result in curl routinely throwing an error. It looks as if this error is related to “method not allowed”, as a GET request resolves to a landing page.</p><p>This problem is not specific to the <code>curl</code> tool, we get exactly the same error with <code>wget</code>:</p><pre><code>wget -S --spider "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.012"</code></pre><h3 id="timeout-errors">Timeout errors</h3><p>Some DOI resolutions resulted in timeout errors, but this was temporary and much less frequent than the errors above.</p><h3 id="resource-not-found">Resource not found</h3><p>We didn’t specifically look into this error, which is a well-known problem with URLs. The DOI names we used were from 2011 and 2012, and it is known that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> is more common the older the resource is.</p><h3 id="content-negotiation">Content negotiation</h3><p>As Karl Ward has pointed out in the comments there are other ways to get to the URL from the DOI name, e.g. using content negotiation:</p><pre><code>curl -LH "Accept: application/vnd.crossref.unixref+xml" "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.012"</code></pre><p>The URL is stored in the <code>doi_data/resource</code> attribute. The URL stored there is unfortunately not always the final landing page for the article, e.g. for the DOI name used in the example above.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>We created a reference set of 10,000 DOIs to collect metrics around them. The first conclusion from this exercise is that getting the URL for these articles is a challenge in many cases. This does not seem to relate to a permission problem for subscription content, but rather how the HTTP HEAD request is handled. Content negotiation is one alternative, but sometimes leads to different URLs for the landing page than where the user would get via the browser. We therefore have to rewrite our code to use GET requests and to better handle the scenarios above.</p><p><em>Update 10/13/13: Updated the title and the text to make it clear that I am not talking about DOIs that don’t resolve for human users, but rather about the problems automating this process using command-line tools.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ten days ago Information Standards Quarterly (ISQ) published a <a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/">special issue on altmetrics</a>. I was the guest editor for the five altmetrics articles, and in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.01">editorial</a> that I titled <strong><strong>Altmetrics have come of age</strong></strong> I argued that</p><blockquote>We no longer need to talk about whether it is possible to reliably collect altmetrics, or whether this is valuable information that can complement citations and usage statistics.</blockquote><p>In June we have seen that the National Information Standards Organization (<a href="http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</a>) was <a href="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.07">awarded a grant</a> by the <a href="http://www.sloan.org/">Sloan Foundation</a> to develop standards and recommended best practices for altmetrics.</p><p>Unfortunately Wikipedia - which is of course an important source of altmetrics information and was also mentioned in the editorial - doesn’t think so.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">description</a> on the Citation Style Language (CSL) website, CSL <em>is an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies</em>. We use reference managers such as <strong>Zotero</strong>, <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong>, or <strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong> to format our references in manuscripts we submit for publication, and underneath a CSL processor such as <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home">Citeproc-js</a> - together with a CSL file for a particular citation style - is doing the work:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://editor.front-matter.io/content/images/2021/02/csl.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="394" height="577"><figcaption>Citation processing during manuscript writing</figcaption></figure><p>When the journal article is accepted the publisher takes the text with the formatted text citation and turns it into XML, a process that is error-prone and takes time:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://editor.front-matter.io/content/images/2021/02/csl2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="454" height="414"><figcaption>Citation processing by the publisher</figcaption></figure><p>It is not hard to see that something is very wrong here:</p><ul><li>Authors are required to use a specific citation style (there are probably about 1,000 different citation styles and many more dependent styles) even though the publisher doesn’t directly use the formatted text. The publisher eLife <a href="http://www.elifesciences.org/elife-references/">accepts references in any format</a>.</li><li>Turning structured information into plain text and back into structured XML is always a bad idea. <a href="http://twitter.com/kaveh1000">Kaveh Bazargan</a> is a typesetter who has gone on record for saying that we should stop this nonsense and put him out of business.</li></ul><p>It is also obvious how the ideal workflow should look like:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://editor.front-matter.io/content/images/2021/02/csl3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="768" height="908"><figcaption>Ideal workflow of citation processing</figcaption></figure><p>We go from structured content to structured content, and never use citations formatted as text as intermediary steps in the workflow.</p><p>What is surprising is that this is an ideal workflow and not something that publishers actually do. Most journal author instructions don’t even mention CSL styles (I work for PLOS and they are no exception). There are some issues to be solved, but they are all minor:</p><ul><li>The Citeproc JSON citation format isn’t really an official standard, but rather something invented for the most popular CSL processor, Citeproc-js.</li><li>People like to fight over standards, and there are always people you prefer bibtex, RIS, MODS or BibJSON over Citeproc JSON, or want authors to to use JATS XML.</li></ul><p>I would really like to push Citeproc JSON as a standard bibliographic exchange format for authors. There are several things I like about Citeproc JSON:</p><ul><li>It is the native format to format citations, so it is used internally by many reference managers anyway.</li><li>Citeproc JSON is really good in handling all the possible variations of author names. Putting all authors into a single text field as in bibtex requires a lot of trickery to get it right.</li><li>JSON is a standard serialization format and there are a kinds of libraries in different programming languages to do things like searching, sorting or finding of duplicates. And JSON is easily extensible, e.g. if we would want to add ORCID identifiers for authors.</li></ul><p>I have five suggestions to move forward:</p><ul><li>Make a specification for Citeproc JSON that is as clear as the CSL specification.</li><li>Consider extending the specification to include content other than citations. Ideally we should be able to add arbitrary <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/29/metadata-in-scholarly-markdown/">metadata about a manuscript</a>.</li><li>Consider other serialization formats besides JSON. I particularly <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/30/citeproc-yaml-for-bibliographies/">like YAML</a> as it is very similar to JSON, but human-readable, but other people might prefer XML. It is relatively easy to transform data between these serialization formats, in particular between JSON and YAML. In my <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About page</a> I only need the <a href="https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml">js-yaml</a> library and one extra line of code to use Citeproc YAML instead of Citeproc JSON (in the d3.js visualization).</li><li>Add Citeproc JSON (and YAML) support to reference managers. Zotero is already doing this, but it should be an easy to add feature if the reference manager is already using CSL internally (Mendeley and Papers).</li><li>Push publishers to accept Citeproc JSON with manuscript submissions.</li></ul>]]></content>

I have started with <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/blog/blob/master/_includes/by_year.js">d3.js code</a> that displays the number of publications per year - using the list of my publications in Citeproc JSON format.

In this case I was really surprised to see how well my different academic jobs over the years (1991-1993, 1994-1998, 1998-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2012) are reflected in my publication pattern. You clearly see the gaps between the jobs, indicating that I not only switched jobs, but also changed the research focus every time. The publications are listed chronologically on the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About page</a> page and you can look at the papers I wrote since my first publication in 1993. My publication pattern seems to indicate that I was never really on track for a typical academic career, so it should not be a surprise that I left academia in 2012.</p><p>There are at least two other visualizations I want to do: publications by type (journal article, book chapter, dataset, etc.), and author position with number of co-authors. You can reuse the Javascript code with small modifications (CSS and the JSON query) even if you are not running a Jekyll blog.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A common feature of blogs written by scientists is a listing of all their publications. Publication lists are a great way to provide background information about your research. Publication lists should provide links to the fulltext versions of these publications, should be nicely formatted - e.g. using a common citation style such as APA - and should be easy to maintain. A number of tools for a variety of blogging platforms (including Wordpress and Jekyll) are available to help with this task, but maintaining the list of publications has remained difficult.</p><p>Publication lists are best maintained in a system built for this purpose. This could be either a reference manager, or a profile page in a social network for scientists. Even better suited for this task is your Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) profile, as this service (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>) directly integrates with a number of bibliographic databases and makes the profile information available via an open API.</p><h3 id="orcid-feed">ORCID Feed</h3><p>Last week I have started work on <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/">ORCID Feed</a>, a service that reformats the API response from ORCID into RSS, bibtex and formattted citations, making it easier for scientists to reuse the content stored in their ORCID profile. This service is still experimental, so please report any issues <a href="https://github.com/orcid-eu-labs/orcid-feed/issues">here</a>.</p><h3 id="jekyll-orcid">jekyll-orcid</h3><p>I have now added the final piece to automatically import my publications into this blog. <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-orcid">jekyll-orcid</a> is a Jekyll plugin that automatically downloads all my publications from my ORCID profile via <strong><strong>ORCID Feed</strong></strong> and stores them in a subfolder of this blog, both in bibtex and Citeproc JSON format. It does this every time you regenerate your blog, so that the publication list will be automatically updated with new content. I can then use <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">jekyll-scholar</a>, a popular Jekyll plugin written by Sylvester Keil to generate a bibliography (<code>jekyll-orcid</code> automatically adds a YAML frontmatter section to the files so that jekyll-scholar can process it). I can format this auto-generated bibliography in a variety of ways - you can see the result in my <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About</a> page where I also provide a download link of the bibtex file.</p><p>My publications are of course also available if I want to cite them in the text, e.g. our recent publication summarizing the main findings from the 2011 European Consensus Conference on germ-cell cancer (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>), or last year’s case report on liver toxicity induced by the cancer drug imatinib (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>).</p><p>Similar tools also exist for Wordpress, e.g. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/papercite/">Papercite</a>, which can import the bibtex file directly from ORCID Feed.</p><h3 id="next">Next</h3><p>Now there is only one step missing to have your paper that was just published automatically appear in your publication list. Assuming you have provided your ORCID identifier when you submitted the paper, and the publisher has included your ORCID identifier in the metadata sent to CrossRef (both are already common practices), we only need CrossRef to automatically push that paper into your ORCID profile.</p><p>And once we have this workflow in place, we can automatically add additional information, including links to the fulltext paper in the institutional repository, copyright information, and metrics.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2>]]></content>

The main difference is the better human readability of YAML.</p><p><strong><strong>Citation Style Language</strong></strong> is described on the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">CSL website</a> as</p><blockquote>CSL is an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies.</blockquote><p>Although some commercial applications still use proprietary citation styles, CSL has become the de facto standard, and is used by the reference managers <strong><strong>Zotero</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong>, and others. This blog uses CSL via Pandoc and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/citeproc-hs/">citeproc-hs</a> library. CSL processors need bibliographic data in a standard format. The popular <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home">Citeproc-js</a> Javascript CSL processor by Frank Bennett for example uses JSON, but we might as well use YAML:</p><h3 id="citeproc-yaml">Citeproc YAML</h3><pre><code>- title: One-click science marketing

You may have noticed that I have inserted my ORCID, something that is very difficult to do with bibtex where all authors are stored in one text string (see above).</p><p>Careful readers of this blog will of course remember that <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/29/metadata-in-scholarly-markdown/">I have written about</a> using YAML to store metadata about a blog post. We could now add bibliographic information to these metadata, either in the YAML frontmatter (if it is a Jekyll blog), or in a separate file. It should be straightforward to adapt the existing CSL processors to understand YAML since YAML and JSON are so similar. To get started with some Citeproc YAML, use the new (and still experimental) <strong><strong>ORCID Feed</strong></strong> Webservice with your ORCID and specify the <code>yml</code> format, e.g. <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.yml">http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.yml</a> for my publications.</p>]]></content>

I have been involved with ORCID since early 2010 and I am happy to see that nine months after launch 200,000 researchers have signed up for the service, and the organization has more than <a href="http://orcid.org/about/community/members">70 member organizations</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src="http://s3.datawrapper.de/BZBSQ/" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen" width="600" height="400"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><a href="https://orcid.org/register">Registering for an ORCID identifier</a> is easy, and can be done in a few minutes. Claiming works in the profile is also straightforward, and works by integration with CrossRef Search, Scopus, Web of Science, DataCite Metadata Search, and other services. Even though about 1.5 million works have been claimed by now, many users have still not claimed any works or added profile information in other ways.</p><p>These numbers should go up as more academic institutions sign up for ORCID and help their researchers create ORCIDs and claim works. In the meantime we need more incentives for researchers to add publications to their ORCID profile. Publication lists are a very good reason to add your papers and other research outputs to your ORCID profile.</p><h3 id="publication-lists">Publication Lists</h3><p>Every researcher maintains a list of his publications in some form. These publication lists are used for grant and job applications, for academic websites to attract collaborators and students, and more. Publication lists can be generated in many different ways, but I have never heard that someone finds this process fun or easy. The challenge is multiplied when the publication list is not generated for an individual, but for a research group, department or institution (my university goes through this process every year uisng RefWorks and produces an <a href="http://www.refworks.com/RefShare2?site=047931198213200000/RWWS6A619751/2013%20Hochschulbibliografie">annual institutional bibliography</a>).</p><p>Although the library usually takes care of the larger publication lists and can help researchers setting up their own lists, there still is much that needs to be done by individual researchers, and the process needs to be easier. Some recommendations are:</p><ul><li>don’t reinvent the wheel</li><li>use persistent identifiers</li><li>use standards</li><li>don’t worry about citation styles</li><li>keep everything upstream, not locally</li></ul><p>Don’t try to invent a new way of managing publication lists. Other people have worked on this problem before, and there are many tools available. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try something new, but please build it on top of all the infrastructure and services we have already.</p><p>Managing publication lists becomes much easier when you use persistent identifiers such as DOIs. They make it much easier to obtain metadata (e.g. authors, title, journal) and the full-text version. Some disciplines use other identifiers, but a local identifier such as a URL is usually a bad idea.</p><p>Use standard protocols, standard file formats and standard metadata. BibTex and RIS are file formats for references that almost every piece of software handling references understands.</p><p>Citation styles come from a time when publications were printed on paper. They make no real sense anymore, and as a researcher you shouldn’t bother which one of 3000+ styles is the appropriate one.</p><p>The last recommendation is the most important one. Don’t try to manage publication lists in your local system, or your department, but rather do this as much upstream as possible. ORCID is an ideal service for this. But don’t try to manually add or edit publications in the ORCID registry, but rather claim them from CrossRef, DataCite or similar services, because these are the places that have authoritative information about publication. If you try to “fix” information (because all metadata can contain mistakes), nobody will notice. If something is wrong with your works, notify the publisher so that the CrossRef metadata can be updated.</p><h3 id="orcid-profiles-as-rss-feeds">ORCID Profiles as RSS Feeds</h3><p>ORCID is a good place to manage publication lists, but it is often not easy to get the information out of the system. The standard way is via a REST API (XML or JSON). This might work really well for a software developer who wants to connect his system to ORCID, but most researchers have other things to do.</p><p>RSS was invented to publish information about frequently updated works, and a good example are Tables of Content (TOC) for journals. RSS is also a great tool to manage publication lists, as it can be easily integrated into content management systems such as Wordpress or Drupal. There is a <a href="http://oxford.crossref.org/best_practice/rss/">Recommendation on RSS Feeds for Scholarly Publishers</a>, and we can apply the same guidelines to <strong><strong>RSS Feeds for Scholarly Authors</strong></strong>. With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> we also have a standard format to aggregate multiple RSS feeds, and this is true not only for journal RSS feeds, but also author RSS feeds.</p><p>Unfortunately there is one missing piece in this workflow: turning ORCID profiles into RSS feeds. At the <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/trading-knowledge/2012/11/13/solo-hackday/">SpotOn London hackathon</a> last November I worked with <a href="http://twitter.com/easternblot">Eva Amsen</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/graemedmoffat">Graeme Moffat</a> to hack this workflow together using available tools. But we really need a more mature solution. Until RSS feeds are provided by the core ORCID service - and there is so much other stuff to do right now that this will take time - the best solution might be a web service that turns ORCID profiles into scholarly RSS as described above for journal articles.</p><p>Today I finally came around implementing a first version of this - hacking together a Ruby Sinatra application hosted on Amazon Web Services (<a href="http://hack4ac.com/">#hack4ac</a> attendees know why). The application takes an ORCID ID (e.g. mine: <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.rss">http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.rss</a>) and returns an RSS feed. The first version just returns just the name and biography from the profile, but I only started working on this today. ORCID Feed can be found at <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/">http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org</a> and the source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/orcid-feed">Github</a>. Please add suggestions and comments to the Github issue tracker <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/orcid-feed/issues">here</a>.</p><p><strong><strong>Update 7/28/13</strong></strong>: <em>I’ve added publications to the output, and additional content types. Use them as extension (e.g. <code>.json</code>), as format parameter (e.g. <code>?format=rss</code>), or use an accept-header, e.g. <code>Accept: application/x-bibtex</code>. I’ve also added basic error checking with cleanup of names and removal of duplicates.</em></p><ul><li>html (the default): forward to profile on the ORCID website</li><li>rss - RSS feed</li><li>bib - bibtex file</li><li>json - Citeproc JSON</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A keynote is a presentation typically given at a start of a conference that sets the central theme for the event. A keynote speaker usually has more time (45-60 min) than other presenters, and has the full attention of everyone attending the conference. The keynotes at the conferences I attended the last several years (mostly scholarly communication conferences) seem to work like this:</p><ul><li>find a prominent speaker, ideally not a core member of the community attending the conference</li><li>tell him to talk about something he knows a lot about, not necessarily a central theme of the conference</li><li>the keynote should be inspiring and eye-opening, instead of focussing on the conference</li></ul><p>The problem with this approach is that it focusses too much on the <em>prominent speaker</em> and it runs the risk of the keynote speaker talking about what he always talks about. Meaning that we don’t learn much if we have heard the keynote speaker before. Which is too bad, because keynotes should contain things that are unexpected and exciting.</p><p>One of the best keynotes I had the pleasure of listening to in the last several years was the one given by <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/">Michael Nielsen</a> at <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/">Science Online London 2011</a> (disclaimer: I was one of the conference organizers). Not only is Michael a very good speaker, but his presentation about <strong><strong>Open Science</strong></strong> fit perfectly into the conference, and it was clear that he had made the presentation specifically for this conference (with an audience that knows a lot about Open Science). One of the main themes of his presentation – the <em>collective action problem</em>, or to get started with something that benefits everyone, but where there is a cost doing the first step - is something I later picked up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1629/24277">in a publication</a> about the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (Fenner, Gomez, &amp; Thorisson, 2011).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/29784152" width="720" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: ff-tisa-web-pro, Georgia, serif; font-size: 21px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"></iframe><figcaption><em>Keynote by Michael Nielsen at the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/">Science Online London 2011 Conference</a>, video recording and editing by <a href="http://river-valley.tv/keynote-solo2011/">River Valley TV</a>.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Luckily we increasingly have video recordings of keynote presentations available online, making it easier to listen to the good presentations. <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx">TED and TEDx</a> have of course made the format of recordings of carefully prepared talks popular.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Figures are an important part of any scientific document. While the kind of figure commonly used obviously varies between disciplines, charts are an important part of many publications. There are two problems in how charts are currently used:</p><ul><li>the data used to draw the chart are not available or difficult to obtain</li><li>charts are drawn as static images with no interactivity, e.g. to see the values of individual data points</li></ul><p>Ross Mounce and others did a <strong><strong>Figures → Data</strong></strong> project at the recent <a href="http://hacka4ac.com/">hack4ac</a> to extract data from figures, described in a <a href="http://rossmounce.co.uk/2013/07/09/hack4ac-recap/">blog post</a>. The experience was painful, even though they started with a <em>really</em> simple chart.</p><p>While we should of course <a href="http://datadryad.org/">publish all data associated with a paper</a>, the smarter strategy to overcome the two limitations above would be to embed the data used for a chart directly into the document. We have many tools that can accomplish this, and I have given an example using R in an <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/17/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">earlier blog post</a>. The problem is the sometimes steep learning curve.</p><p>One approach is to build an easy-to use online tool, and <a href="http://datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> is exactly that:</p><blockquote>An open source tool helping anyone to create simple, correct and embeddable charts in minutes.</blockquote><p>Datawrapper uses the <strong><strong>d3.js</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Highcharts</strong></strong> Javascript libraries for data visualizations, and the service is easy to use. It took me for example about 15 min to generate the chart below. The data used for the chart are embedded (click <strong><strong>Get the data</strong></strong>) and you can hover over the chart to see the actual numbers by month.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe title="Monthly Article Views Over Time" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-6EQUJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6EQUJ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Most journal articles see the highest usage immediately after publication, and the light purple line shows this pattern for Darcy et al. (2009). The dark purple line for Moher et al. (2009) – published on the same day – on the other hand shows a highly unusual usage pattern, as the usage actually increases over time, starting about 1 1/2 years after publication. The article is a guideline for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and is now viewed more often than directly after publication four years ago.</p><p>Datawrapper does three things: it makes it easy to generate charts, it allows you to embed them directly into your webpage (using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag), and it is Open Source software (MIT license, Github repo <a href="https://github.com/datawrapper/datawrapper">here</a>) so that you can help improve the code and host this service on your own. DataWrapper was written in Javascript and PHP by a group of German journalists, and the main focus is data journalism where the service has become really <a href="http://blog.datawrapper.de/2013/datawrapper-crosses-mark-of-10-million-visits/">popular</a> with more than 3.5 million views of embedded charts in May 2013 alone.</p><p>Datawrapper is a perfect tool for science blogs and websites with scientific content, but it can also enhance the charts in scientific articles. We need a few additional chart types, error bars and more flexible labeling. And we might want to add a license picker, making it easy to add a Creative Commons license so that it is clear how the chart can be reused. Datawrapper is intended for online use, but the service can also save the charts as PNG or PDF. We would want to add saving to SVG (already used for online rendering) for easier embedding into the XML and ePub versions of articles.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>D’Arcy, E., &amp; Moynihan, R.

Article-Level Metrics focuses on articles, but also looks at traditional citations and usage statistics. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics</a> project was started in 2008. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics manifesto</a> was published in October 2010 and described the fundamental ideas. By October 2011 we had a number of altmetrics tools, fueled by the Mendeley/PLOS API <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/">programming contest</a>. In 2012 the focus shifted from the fact that we can provide these numbers to a discussion of the many open questions. We could see this at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/06/25/random-notes-from-the-altmetrics12-conference/">altmetrics12 conference </a>in June, and even more so at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/">altmetrics workshop</a> hosted by PLOS last week in San Francisco.</p><p>Altmetrics can provide a large amount of information about the post-publication activity around an article (and other scholarly content), and this is exciting, but at the same time also somewhat overwhelming and scary. Some of the things that we as a community have to figure out include standards for collecting, aggregating and displaying altmetrics data, strategies to combat attempts to game these metrics, and finding appropriate ways for the different organizations providing altmetrics to work together as a community. These and other topics were discussed in great detail at the PLOS altmetrics workshop, and we made excellent progress not least thanks to the excellent moderation by <em>Cameron Neylon</em>. The third day of the workshop was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/altmetrics-hackathon">hackathon</a>, and we were able to translate some of the ideas into prototypes of new tools.</p><p>The most important conclusion from the workshop for me personally was that we should really should focus on use cases. Altmetrics should help answer questions that we can’t answer today, and despite the promise, the various altmetrics tools still have a log way to go. A case in point is the promise that altmetrics can make it easier to find relevant scholarly content. We all use social media to help us find papers and other stuff, but integration of altmetrics into the traditional scholarly search tools is still missing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://rerank.it/">ReRank</a> is a cool prototype developed during the hackathon last Saturday, but we are still a long way from having altmetrics feeding directly into the relevance sorting of search results.</p><p>With these thoughts in the back of mind, I look forward to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-altmetrics-beyond-the-numbers/">altmetrics session</a> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/in/london/">SpotOn London conference</a> this Sunday afternoon. <em>Sarah Venis</em> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.msf.org/">Médecins sans Frontières</a> (MSF) will talk about the questions that she hopes altmetrics can answer for her organization. MSF is very interested to look beyond citations for the impact of their publications, as their primary target audience is not really the scholarly community, but rather people in need in various parts of the world. <em>Marie Boran</em> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.deri.ie/about/team/member/marie_boran/">Digital Research Enterprise Institute</a> (DERI) is interested in using altmetrics as a recommendation tool to find researchers with similar interests. <em>Euan Adie</em> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a> and I (technical lead for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics project</a>) will use our respective tools to try to answer some of these questions. For me altmetrics are primarily tools to tell a good story, and that is one reason why we picked the title <em>Altmetrics beyond the Numbers</em> for this session. The focus of the session will then shift to an open discussion, and I hope we can get some good answers to this and other questions.</p><p>A clear focus on use cases should go a long way to reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed by all the numbers that altmetrics can provide. If we have specific goals for which we need altmetrics, it becomes much easier to decide what numbers work best for us, what standards we need and whom to ask to collect this information. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-altmetrics-everywhere-but-what-are-we-missing-solo12impact/">AJ Cann</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2012/11/08/understanding-the-limits-of-altmetrics-slideshare-statistics/">Brian Kelly </a>have written two excellent blog post about the confusion that too many altmetrics numbers can create, and the workshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-assessing-social-media-impact/">Assessing Social Media Impact</a> during SpotOn London addresses some of these questions.

ENA identifiers (for nucleotide sequences in GenBank, EMBL or DDBJ) make up the largest group, with 160,112 identifiers found in the 410,364 articles that were analyzed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/journal.pone.0063184.g003.png" class="kg-image" alt="Database Citation in Full Text Biomedical Articles.

One of the conclusions drawn by the author is that</p><blockquote>Text-mining can be used to extend structured data citation, and could be a basis for the development of services to help authors or editors to add structured content at the beginning of the publication process, rather than after the fact.</blockquote><p>Adding structured data citations during the authoring phase of a manuscript requires tools that make this process easier, providing auto-linking and verification of the without requiring extra input from the author. Scholarly Markdown is an ideal platform for these tools, as it is easier to extend than traditional word processors such as Microsoft Word. During a small workshop around persistent identifiers for data (<a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a>), people (<a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) and geological samples (<a href="http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout">IGSN</a>) that took place yesterday and today at the <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/cegit">GFZ Potsdam</a> I worked on a tool that does auto-linking for these identifiers:</p><ul><li>IGSN. <a href="http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout">International Geosample Number</a></li><li>MGI identifiers for genetically modified mouse strains in the <a href="http://www.findmice.org/about">Internal Mouse Strain Resource</a></li><li>ENA. <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/about">Genbank / ENA / DDBJ nucleotide sequences</a></li><li>UniProt protein sequences from the <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/about">UniProt database</a></li><li>PDB. <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=home/faq.html">Protein Data Bank protein structure information</a></li></ul><p>The list includes the IGSN, the database identifiers studied by Kafkas et al (2013), and the MGI identifier for genetically altered mice. In the life sciences there is a long tradition - and requirement by journals - to use database identifiers for data, but identifiers for resources such as genetically modified mice are unfortunately not in common use.</p><p>This blog uses the Pandoc markdown processor and the Jekyll static website generator. The easiest way to implement this functionality was by writing a filter for the liquid templating engine used by Jekyll, and provide this filter as a Jekyll plugin. The Jekyll plugin can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-scholmd">mfenner/jekyll-scholmd</a>. The plugin expects the name of the identifier, followed by a colon and optional space, followed by the identifier:</p><pre><code>GenBank:  M10090
IGSN:  JRH964436
MGI:  96922
UniProt:  P02144
PDB:  1mbn</code></pre><p>This input is automatically translated into <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/M10090">GenBank:M10090</a>, <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10273/JRH964436">IGSN:JRH964436</a>, <a href="http://www.findmice.org/summary?gaccid/96922">MGI:96922</a>, and information about the human myoglobin protein (<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02144">UniProt:P02144</a>, <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1mbn">PDB:1mbn</a>) is generated in a similar fashion.</p><p>The plugin was written in a few hours today, and is my first Jekyll plugin. There is room for improvement, e.g. support for more identifiers, better regex matching, validation of the resulting links, and automated tag generation if an identifier is found. Ideally the auto-linking should happen in the markdown and not the HTML output, so that these structured database links are also available in other markdown outputs such as PDF. But this is another example how Scholarly Markdown can make it easier for researchers to author documents without requiring a fancy web-based user interface.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Kafkas, Ş., Kim, J.-H., &amp; McEntyre, J.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scholarly documents often need metadata that describe them: typically author(s), title and location (DOI or URL), but possibly many other things. For some metadata it makes sense to store them in the document text, e.g. as is typically done for citations. The problem is that this can make it hard to make the metadata machine-readable. The worst place for metadata is of course outside of the document, and unfortunately that it is the most common way of doing this. Two examples:</p><ul><li>Manuscript submission. Papers submitted to scholarly journals contain the metadata in the text, but authors are required to enter the information again into a webform. You can add metadata (<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/word-help/add-property-information-to-a-document-HA010163766.aspx">property information</a>) to Microsoft Word documents, but it seems that nobody is doing it.</li><li>PDFs and image files. Even though we have at least one good standard with <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/">XMP</a> to store metadata in these documents, it is not a common practice. Information about these documents is therefore stored somewhere else and doesn’t automatically travel with them.</li></ul><p>The best place for metadata is the document itself, and the metadata should be stored in machine-readable format. Another requirement is flexibility in what we can store, and we shouldn’t limit ourselves to a predefined list. Pandoc for example allows only three attributes in the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">title block</a>:</p><pre><code>% title
% author(s) (separated by semicolons)
% date</code></pre><p>For Scholarly Markdown we have another requirement: the metadata should be writeable and readable by humans. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> is the perfect format for this. JSON is closely related to YAML (and is in fact a subset of YAML 1.2), but YAML can also be written with whitespace instead of curly braces. The static website generator Jekyll - which I use to parse the markdown for this blog into HTML - uses YAML at the beginning of markdown documents to store metadata, and we can easily extend this functionality. Carl Boettinger posted a comment yesterday saying that YAML support is on the Pandoc development roadmap.</p><p>Below is the YAML for (Ethan P. White, 2013), where I reposted a paper written in markdown:</p><pre><code>---

Making your data publicly available allows original results to be reproduced and new analyses to be conducted. While sharing your data is the first step in allowing reuse, it is also important that the data be easy to understand and use. We describe nine simple ways to make it easy to reuse the data that you share and also make it easier to work with it yourself. Our recommendations focus on making your data understandable, easy to analyze, and readily available to the wider community of scientists.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Sharing data is increasingly recognized as an important component of the scientific process (Whitlock, McPeek, Rausher, Rieseberg, &amp; Moore, 2010). The sharing of scientific data is beneficial because it allows replication of research results and reuse in meta-analyses and projects not originally intended by the data collectors (Poisot, Mounce, &amp; Gravel, 2013). In ecology and evolutionary biology, sharing occurs through a combination of formal data repositories like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a> and <a href="http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>, and through individual and institutional websites.</p><p>While data sharing is increasingly common and straightforward, much of the shared data in ecology and evolutionary biology are not easily reused because they do not follow best practices in terms of data structure, metadata, and licensing (M. B. Jones, Schildhauer, Reichman, &amp; Bowers, 2006). This makes it more difficult to work with existing data and therefore makes the data less useful than it could be (M. B. Jones et al., 2006; O. J. Reichman, Jones, &amp; Schildhauer, 2011). Here we provide a list of 9 simple ways to make it easier to reuse the data that you share.</p><p>Our recommendations focus on making your data understandable, easy to work with, and available to the wider community of scientists. They are designed to be simple and straightforward to implement, and as such represent an introduction to good data practices rather than a comprehensive treatment. We contextualize our recommendations with examples from ecology and evolutionary biology, though many of the recommendations apply broadly across scientific disciplines. Following these recommendations makes it easier for anyone to reuse your data including other members of your lab and even yourself.</p><h2 id="1-share-your-data">1. Share your data</h2><p>The first and most important step in sharing your data is to share your data. The recommendations below will help make your data more useful, but sharing it in any form is a big step forward. So, why should you share your data?</p><p>Data sharing provides substantial benefits to the scientific community (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985). It allows</p><ol><li>the results of existing analyses to be reproduced and improved upon (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985; Poisot et al., 2013),</li><li>data to be combined in meta-analyses to reach general conclusions (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985),</li><li>new approaches to be applied to the data and new questions asked using it (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985), and</li><li>approaches to scientific inquiry that couldn’t even be considered without broad scale data sharing (Hampton et al., 2013).</li></ol><p>As a result, data sharing is increasingly required by funding agencies (Poisot et al. (2013); e.g., <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">NSF</a>, <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html">NIH</a>, <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/FinancialAdminGuide-GuideAdminFinancier/Responsibilities-Responsabilites_eng.asp">NSERC</a>, <a href="http://www.fwf.ac.at/en/public_relations/oai/index.html">FWF</a>), journals (Whitlock et al., 2010), and potentially by law (e.g. <a href="http://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/2013%2002%2014%20DOYLE%20FASTR%20FINAL.pdf">FASTR</a>).</p><p>Despite these potential benefits to the community, many scientists are still reluctant to share data. This reluctance is largely due to perceived fears of 1) competition for publications based on the shared data, 2) technical barriers, and 3) a lack of recognition for sharing data (Hampton et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2004). These concerns are often not as serious as they first appear, and the minimal costs associated with data sharing are frequently offset by individual benefits to the data sharer (Hampton et al., 2013; Parr &amp; Cummings, 2005). Many data sharing initiatives allow for data embargoes or limitations on direct competition that can last for several years while the authors develop their publications and thus avoid competition for deriving publications from the data. Also, logistical barriers to data sharing are diminishing as data archives become increasingly common and easy to use (Hampton et al., 2013; Parr &amp; Cummings, 2005). Datasets are now considered citable entities and data providers receive recognition in the form of increased citation metrics and credit on CVs and grant applications (Heather A Piwowar &amp; Vision, 2013; Heather A. Piwowar, Day, &amp; Fridsma, 2007; Poisot et al., 2013). In addition to increased citation rates, shared datasets that are documented and standardized are also more easily reused in the future by the original investigator. As a result, it is increasingly beneficial to the individual researcher to share data in the most useful manner possible.</p><h2 id="2-provide-metadata">2. Provide metadata</h2><p>The first key to using data is understanding it. Metadata is information about the data including how it was collected, what the units of measurement are, and descriptions of how to best use the data. Clear metadata makes it easier to figure out if a dataset is appropriate for a project. It also makes data easier to use by both the original investigators and by other scientists by making it easy to figure out how to work with the data. Without clear metadata, datasets can be overlooked or not used due to the difficulty of understanding the data (Fraser &amp; Gluck, 1999; A. S. Zimmerman, 2003), and the data becomes less useful over time (Michener, Brunt, Helly, Kirchner, &amp; Stafford, 1997).</p><p>Metadata can take several forms, including descriptive file and column names, a written description of the data, images (<em>i.e.,</em> maps, photographs), and specially structured information that can be read by computers. Good metadata should provide 1) the what, when, where, and how of data collection, 2) how to find and access the data, 3) suggestions on the suitability of the data for answering specific questions, 4) warnings about known problems or inconsistencies in the data, and 5) information to check that the data are properly imported, such as the number of rows and columns in the dataset and the total sum of numerical columns (Michener et al., 1997; Strasser, Cook, Michener, &amp; Budden, 2012; A. S. Zimmerman, 2003).</p><p>Just like any other scientific publication, metadata should be logically organized, complete, and clear enough to enable interpretation and use of the data (A. Zimmerman, 2007). Specific metadata standards exist (<em>e.g.,</em> Ecological Metadata Language <a href="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/">EML</a>, Directory Interchange Format <a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/add/difguide/index.html">DIF</a>, Darwin Core <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/">DWC</a> (Wieczorek et al., 2012), Dublin Core Metadata Initiative <a href="http://dublincore.org/metadata-basics/">DCMI</a>, Federal Geographic Data Committee <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards">FGDC</a> (O. J. Reichman et al., 2011; Whitlock, 2011). These standards are designed to provide consistency in metadata across different datasets and also to allow computers to interpret the metadata automatically. This allows broader and more efficient use of shared data (Brunt, McCartney, Baker, &amp; Stafford, 2002; M. B. Jones et al., 2006). While following these standards is valuable, the most important thing is to have metadata at all.</p><p>You don’t need to spend a lot of extra time to write good metadata. The easiest way to develop metadata is to start describing your data during the planning and data collection stages. This will help you stay organized, make it easier to work with your data after it has been collected, and make eventual publication of the data easier. If you decide to take the extra step and follow metadata standards, there are tools designed to make this easier including: <a href="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morpho%20portal.jsp">KNB Morpho</a>, <a href="http://geology.usgs.gov/tools/metadata/tools/doc/xtme.html">USGS xtme</a>, and <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/documents/workbook_0501_bmk.pdf">FGDC workbook</a>.</p><h2 id="3-provide-an-unprocessed-form-of-the-data">3. Provide an unprocessed form of the data</h2><p>Often, the data used in scientific analyses are modified in some way from the original form in which they were collected. This is done to address the questions of interest in the best manner possible and to address common limitations associated with the raw data. However, the best way to process data depends on the question being asked and corrections for common data limitations often change as better approaches are developed. It can also be very difficult to combine data from multiple sources that have each been processed in different ways. Therefore, to make your data as useful as possible it is best to share the data in as raw a form as possible.</p><p>This is not to say that your data are best suited for analysis in the raw form, but providing it in the raw form gives data users the most flexibility. Of course, your work to develop and process the data is also very important and can be quite valuable for other scientists using your data. This is particularly true when correcting data for common limitations. Providing both the raw and processed forms of the data, and clearly explaining the differences between them in the metadata, is an easy way to include the benefits of both data forms. An alternate approach is to share the unprocessed data along with the code that process the data to the form you used for analysis. This allows other scientists to assess and potentially modify the process by which you arrived at the values used in your analysis.</p><h2 id="4-use-standard-data-formats">4. Use standard data formats</h2><p>Everyone has their own favorite tools for storing and analyzing data. To make it easy to use your data it is best to store it in a standard format that can be used by many different kinds of software. Good standard formats include the type of file, the overall structure of the data, and the specific contents of the file.</p><h3 id="use-standard-file-formats">Use standard file formats</h3><p>You should use file formats that are readable by most software and, when possible, are non-proprietary (Borer, Seabloom, Jones, &amp; Schildhauer, 2009; Strasser, Cook, Michener, Budden, &amp; Koskela, 2011; Strasser et al., 2012). Certain kinds of data in ecology and evolution have well established standard formats such as <a href="http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/FASTA/">FASTA</a> files for nucleotide or peptide sequences and the <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html">Newick files</a> for phylogenetic trees. Use these well defined formats when they exist, because that is what other scientists and most existing software will be able to work with most easily.</p><p>Data that does not have a well defined standard format is often stored in tables. Tabular data should be stored in a format that can be opened by any type of software to increase reuseability of the data, i.e. text files. These text files use delimiters to indicate different columns. Commas are the most commonly used delimiter (i.e., comma-delimited text files with the .csv extension). Tabs can also be used as a delimiter, although problems can occur in displaying the data correctly when importing data from one program to another. In contrast to plain text files, proprietary formats such as those used by Microsoft Excel (e.g, .xls, .xlsx) can be difficult to load into other programs. In addition, these types of files can become obsolete, eventually making it difficult to open the data files at all if the newer versions of the software no longer support the original format (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012).</p><p>When naming files you should use descriptive names so that it is easy to keep track of what data they contain (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012). If there are multiple files in a dataset, name them in a consistent manner to make it easier to automate working with them. You should also avoid spaces in file names, which can cause problems for some software (Borer et al., 2009). Spaces in file names can be avoided by using camel case (e.g, RainAvg) or by separating the words with underscores (e.g., rain_avg).</p><h3 id="use-standard-table-formats">Use standard table formats</h3><p>Data tables are ubiquitous in ecology and evolution. Tabular data provides a great deal of flexibility in how to structure the data, which makes it easy to structure the data in a way that is difficult to (re)use. We provide three simple recommendations to help ensure that tabular data are properly structured to allow the data to be easily imported and analyzed by most data management systems and common analysis software, such as R and Python.</p><ul><li>Each row should represent a single observation (i.e., a record) and each column should represent a single variable or type of measurement (i.e., a field) (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012). This is the standard format for tables in the most commonly used database management systems and analysis packages and makes the data easy to work with in the most general way.</li><li>Every cell should contain only a single value (Strasser et al., 2012). For example, do not include units in the cell with the values (Figure 1) or include multiple measurements in a single cell, and break taxonomic information up into single components with one column each for family, genus, species, subspecies, etc. Violating this rule makes it difficult to process or analyze your data using standard tools, because there is no easy way for the software to treat the items within a cell as separate pieces of information.</li><li>There should only be one column for each type of information (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012). The most common violation of this rule is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_tabulation">cross-tab structured data</a>, where different columns contain measurements of the same variable (e.g., in different sites, treatments, etc.; Figure 1).</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/Data_formatting.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Figure 1.

If more than one value is present then the data should be split into multiple columns. (b) There should be only one column for each type of information. If there are multiple columns then the column header should be stored in one column and the values from each column should be stored in a single column.</figcaption></figure><p>While cross-tab data can be useful for its readability, and may be appropriate for data collection, this format makes it difficult to link the records with additional data (e.g., the location and environmental conditions at a site) and it cannot be properly used by most common database management and analysis tools (e.g., relational databases, dataframes in R and Python, etc.). If tabular data are currently in a cross-tab structure, there are tools to help restructure the data including functions in Excel, R (e.g., melt() function in the R package reshape; Wickham (2007)), and Python (e.g., melt() function in the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> Python module.</p><p>In addition to following these basic rules you should also make sure to use descriptive column names (Borer et al., 2009). Descriptive column names make the data easier to understand and therefore make data interpretation errors less likely. As with file names, spaces can cause problems for some software and should be avoided.</p><h3 id="use-standard-formats-within-cells">Use standard formats within cells</h3><p>In addition to using standard table structures it is also important to ensure that the contents of each cell don’t cause problems for data management and analysis software. Specifically, we recommend:</p><ul><li>Be consistent. For example, be consistent in your capitalization of words, choice of delimiters, and naming conventions for variables.</li><li>Avoid special characters. Most software for storing and analyzing data works best on plain text, and accents and other special characters can make it difficult to import your data (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2012).</li><li>Avoid using your delimiter in the data itself (e.g., commas in the notes filed of a comma-delimited file). This can make it difficult to import your data properly. This means that if you are using commas as the decimal separator (as is often done in continental Europe) then you should use a non-comma delimiter (e.g., a tab).</li><li>When working with dates use the YYYY-MM-DD format (i.e., follow the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/iso8601">ISO 8601</a> data standard).</li></ul><h2 id="5-use-good-null-values">5. Use good null values</h2><p>Most ecological and evolutionary datasets contain missing or empty data values. Working with this kind of “null” data can be difficult, especially when the null values are indicated in problematic ways. Unfortunately, there are many different ways to indicate a missing/empty value, and very little agreement on which approach to use.</p><p>We recommend choosing a null value that is both compatible with most software and unlikely to cause errors in analyses (Table 1). The null value that is most compatible with the software commonly used by biologists is the blank (i.e., nothing; Table 1). Blanks are automatically treated as null values by R, Python, SQL, and Excel. They are also easily spotted in a visual examination of the data. Note that a blank involves entering nothing, it is not a space, so if you use this option make sure there aren’t any hidden spaces. There are two potential issues with blanks that should be considered:</p><ol><li>It can be difficult to know if a value is missing or was overlooked during data entry.</li><li>They can be confusing when spaces or tabs are used as delimiters in text files.</li></ol><p>NA and NULL are reasonable null values, but they are only handled automatically by a subset of commonly used software (Table 1). NA can also be problematic if it is also used as an abbreviation (e.g., North America, Namibia, <em>Neotoma albigula</em>, sodium, etc.). We recommend against using numerical values to indicate nulls (e.g., 999, -999, etc.) because they typically require an extra step to remove from analyses and can be accidentally included in calculations. We also recommend against using non-standard text indications (e.g., No data, ND, missing, —) because they can cause issues with software that requires consistent data types within columns). Whichever null value that you use, only use one, use it consistently throughout the data set, and indicate it clearly in the metadata.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 19px; font-family: ff-tisa-sans-web-pro, Arial, sans-serif; width: 750px; margin-bottom: 21px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"><caption style="box-sizing: border-box; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.33; margin-bottom: 0.75em;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">Tabel 1.

Make it easy to combine your data with other datasets</h2><p>Ecological and evolutionary data are often most valuable when combined with other kinds of data (e.g., taxonomic, environmental). You can make it easier to combine your data with other data sources by including the data that is common across many data sources (e.g., Latin binomials, latitudes and longitudes) It is common for data to include codes or abbreviations. For example, in ecology and evolution codes often appear in place of site locations or taxonomy. This is useful because it reduces data entry (e.g., DS instead of <em>Dipodomys spectabilis</em>) and redundancy (a single column for a species ID rather than separate columns for family, genus, and species). However, without clear definitions these codes can be difficult to understand and make it more difficult to connect your data with external sources. The easiest way to link your data to other datasets is to include additional tables that contain a column for the code and additional columns that describe the item in the standard way. For example, you might include a table with the species codes followed by their most current family, genus, and specific epithet. For site location, you could include a table with the site code followed by latitude and longitude. Linked tables can also be used to include additional information about your data, such as spatial extent, temporal duration, and other appropriate details.</p><h2 id="7-perform-basic-quality-control">7. Perform basic quality control</h2><p>Data, just like any other scientific product, should undergo some level of quality control (O. J. Reichman et al., 2011). This is true regardless of whether you plan to share the data because quality control will make it easier to analyze your own data and decrease the chance of making mistakes. However, it is particularly important for data that will be shared because scientists using the data won’t be familiar with quirks in the data and how to work around them.</p><p>At its most basic, quality control can consist of a few quick sanity checks of the data. More advanced quality control can include automated checks on data as it is entered and double-entry of data (Lampe &amp; Weiler, 1998; Paulsen, Overgaard, &amp; Lauritsen, 2012). This additional effort can be time consuming, but is valuable because it increases data accuracy by catching typographical errors, reader/recorder error, out-of-range values, and questionable data in general (Lampe &amp; Weiler, 1998; Paulsen et al., 2012).</p><p>Before sharing your data we recommend performing a quick “data review”. Start by performing some basic sanity checks on your data. For example:</p><ul><li>If a column should contain numeric values, check that there are no non-numeric values in the data.</li><li>Check that empty cells actually represent missing data, and not mistakes in data entry, and indicate that they are empty using the appropriate null values (see recommendation 6).</li><li>Check for consistency in unit of measurement, data type (e.g., numeric, character), naming scheme (e.g., taxonomy, location), etc.</li></ul><p>These checks can be performed by carefully looking at the data or can be automated using common programming and analysis tools like R or Python.</p><p>Then ask someone else to look over your metadata and data and provide you with feedback about anything they didn’t understand. In the same way that friendly reviews of papers can help catch mistakes and identify confusing sections of papers, a friendly review of data can help identify problems and things that are unclear in the data and metadata.</p><h2 id="8-use-an-established-repository">8. Use an established repository</h2><p>For data sharing to be effective, data should be easy to find, accessible, and stored where it will be preserved for a long time (Kowalczyk &amp; Shankar, 2011). To make your data (and associated code) visible and easily accessible, and to ensure a permanent link to a well maintained website, we suggest depositing your data in one of the major well-established repositories. This guarantees that the data will be available in the same location for a long time, in contrast to personal and institutional websites that do not guarantee the long-term persistence of the data. There are repositories available for sharing almost any type of biological or environmental data. Repositories that host specific data types, such as molecular sequences (e.g., DDBJ, GenBank, MG-RAST), are often highly standardized in data type, format, and quality control approaches. Other repositories host a wide array of data types and are less standardized (e.g., Dryad, KNB, PANGAEA). In addition to the repositories focused on the natural sciences there are also all purpose repositories where data of any kind can be shared (e.g., figshare).</p><p>When choosing a repository you should consider where other researchers in your discipline are sharing their data. This helps you quickly identify the community’s standard approach to sharing and increases the likelihood that other scientists will discover your data. In particular, if there is a centralized repository for a specific kind of data (e.g., GenBank for sequence data) then you should use that repository.</p><p>In cases where there is no <em>de facto</em> standard it is worth considering differences among repositories in terms of use, data rights, and licensing (Table 2) and whether your funding agency or journal has explicit requirements or restrictions related to repositories. We also recommend that you use a repository that allows your dataset to be easily cited. Most repositories will describe how this works, but an easy way to guarantee that your data are citable is to confirm that the repository associates it with a persistent identifier, the most popular of which is the digital object identifier (DOI). DOIs are permanent unique identifiers that are independent of physical location and site ownership. There are also online tools for finding good repositories for your data including <a href="http://databib.org/">Databib</a> and <a href="http://re3data.org/">re3data</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 19px; font-family: ff-tisa-sans-web-pro, Arial, sans-serif; width: 750px; margin-bottom: 21px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"><caption style="box-sizing: border-box; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.33; margin-bottom: 0.75em;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">Table 2.

Use an established and liberal license</h2><p>Including an explicit license with your data is the best way to let others know exactly what they can and cannot do with the data you shared. Following the <a href="http://pantonprinciples.org/">Panton Principles</a> we recommend:</p><ol><li>Using well established licenses in order to clearly communicate the rights and responsibilities of both the people providing the data and the people using it.</li><li>Using the most open license possible, because even minor restrictions on data use can have unintended consequences for the reuse of the data (Poisot et al., 2013; Schofield et al., 2009).</li></ol><p>The Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) places no restrictions on data use and is considered by many to be one of the best license for sharing data (e.g., (Poisot et al., 2013; Schofield et al., 2009), <a href="http://blog.datadryad.org/2011/10/05/why-does-dryad-use-cc0/">Why does Dryad use CC0</a>). Having a clear and open license will increase the chance that other scientists will be comfortable using your data.</p><h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h2><p>Data sharing has the potential to transform the way we conduct ecological and evolutionary research (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985; Poisot et al., 2013; Whitlock et al., 2010). As a result, there are an increasing number of initiatives at the federal, funding agency, and journal levels to encourage or require the sharing of the data associated with scientific research (Heather A Piwowar &amp; Chapman, 2008; Poisot et al., 2013; Whitlock et al., 2010). However, making the data available is only the first step. To make data sharing as useful as possible it is necessary to make the data usable with as little effort as possible (M. B. Jones et al., 2006; O. J. Reichman et al., 2011). This allows scientists to spend their time doing science rather than cleaning up data.</p><p>We have provided a list of 9 practices that require only a small additional time investment but substantially improve the usability of data. These practices can be broken down into three major groups.</p><ol><li>Well documented data are easier to understand.</li><li>Properly formatted data are easier to use in a variety of software.</li><li>Data that is shared in established repositories with open licenses is easier for others to find and use.</li></ol><p>Most of these recommendations are simply good practice for working with data regardless of whether that data are shared or not. This means that following these recommendations (2-7) make the data easier to work with for anyone, including you. This is particularly true when returning to your own data for further analysis months or years after you originally collected or analyzed it. In addition, data sharing often occurs within a lab or research group. Good data sharing practices make these in-house collaborations faster, easier, and less dependent on lab members who may have graduated or moved on to other things.</p><p>By following these practices we can assure that the data collected in ecology and evolution can be used to its full potential to improve our understanding of biological systems.</p><h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2><p>Thanks to Karthik Ram for organizing this special section and inviting us to contribute.

        <updated>2013-06-24T17:08:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/19/citations-in-scholarly-markdown/">post last week</a> and the crazy discussion that followed I would understand that you feel you have heard enough about citations in markdown. But I had the feeling last week that something was still missing, and I have done some more thinking. What we have so far:</p><ul><li>Pandoc has nice support for citations, including Citation Style Language support (i.e. it is using the same 5000+ citation styles as Zotero, Mendeley and Papers).</li><li>Pandoc requires a separate file to store the citations, typically in bibtex format. This is fine for some people, but can make the workflow complicated for short documents or when several people work on the bibliography at the same time.</li><li>Citations are similar to links, and we can use links for almost all the functionality we need, making it much easier to add citations to a text. The problem is a) citations that don’t include a weblink, b) being able to do this offline, and c) where in the HTML to store the citation metadata.</li></ul><p>And I looked at how Wikipedia is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources">doing this</a>, and they use a) links, b) citations and c) footnotes. If Wikipedia thinks that it can’t do without citations and do everything as links, then maybe we also shouldn’t enforce this for scholarly texts.</p><p>I think what we need is the best of both worlds. We should use the Pandoc citation workflow, as it is similar to what we are used to from other authoring environments, and we get good citation style support, including more complex formatting of references. Some reference managers already support copy/paste of Pandoc citation keys. The inclusion of a bibtex file with a scholarly markdown text is also a bonus, as it allows the automated extraction of citations, e.g. by manuscript submission systems.</p><p>We also want to support a simpler solution for shorter texts or when people don’t want to use a separate bibtex file. Here we would add the citations as links, ideally in a syntax very similar to Pandoc citation keys:</p><pre><code>Johnson [@Johnson2006] didn't agree with ...

[@Johnson2006]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aris.201 "Data sharing in the sciences"</code></pre><p>We need to write a tool that parses the markdown before Pandoc, fetches the citation metadata for these links in bibtex format (e.g. using CrossRef Content Negotiation), and adds them to the existing bibtex file (or creates a new bibtex file). The next time the markdown is parsed, the citation is already “cached” in the bibtex file. Those people who don’t have such a tool would see the citation as link (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>), with the essential information (DOI or URL) preserved so that a downstream tool can fetch the bibliographic information. Some people were worried about typos in DOIs and URLs. They can add additional information - e.g. the title of the paper - in double quotes to allow checking of the correct DOI.</p><p>This workflow now makes a lot of sense to me, as it uses existing solutions, but also allows for easy entering of citation information in a way similar to the <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</a> tools. As I use jekyll and am a Ruby developer, I will implement the citation parsing as a jekyll plugin.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One important outcome of the recent <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/workshop">Markdown for Science</a> workshop was an overall agreement that all the different implementations (or flavors) of markdown that currently exist are a big problem for the adoption of Scholarly Markdown and that we <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">need</a>:</p><blockquote>A reference implementation with documentation and tests</blockquote><p>As described by Karthik Ram (<a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/workshop">31 flavors is great for ice cream but not markdown</a>), <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/what-flavor-is-scholarly-markdown/@flavor">me</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-future-of-markdown.html">others</a>, there is really a large number of markdown implementations to choose from, including</p><ul><li>John Gruber’s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">original Markdown</a></li><li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Github-flavored Markdown</a></li><li><a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown Extra</a></li><li><a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a></li><li><a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a></li></ul><p>These different flavors all serve their needs, but for Markdown to take off in the relatively small scholarly community it would be very helpful to come up with a reference implementation. But how do we get to that point?</p><ol><li>Think about the features we need for Scholarly Markdown and make this the reference implementation?</li><li>Organize a working group or committee that decides what is Scholarly Markdown?</li><li>Pick the Markdown flavor with the best developer support?</li><li>Figure out what markdown flavor has the widest support by tools relevant for scholars?</li><li>See what markdown flavor most scholars are currently using?</li></ol><p>I think as a starting point, and until we come up with something better, #5 makes the most sense. The number of markdown users among scholars is still small, but my guess would be that Pandoc is currently the most popular Markdown flavor among scholars. This blog uses Pandoc and the static site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> - for the source code use the link in the footer. Please tell me in the comments what you are using (Markdown flavor and tools), and whether I am correct with my wild guess regarding Pandoc. And make sure your preferred tool is listed in the <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring">Tools to support your markdown authoring</a> wiki page.</p><p>A reference Markdown document is also very helpful to move forward, as we can see what outputs in HTML, PDF (or other formats) our specific Markdown tools produce, and how they differ. This reference document should include citations, tables, figures, and other features typical for scholarly content. Ideally this is a paper written in Markdown and accepted for publication - proving the concept -, or it can be a published paper transformed into markdown, e.g. a paper by <a href="http://www.elifesciences.org/elife-now-supports-content-negotiation/">eLife</a>. Feel free to suggest a paper in the comments.</p><p>The idea of tests that came up in the Markdown workshop is also great. Ideally we have a set of tests that we (or someone else, e.g. a publisher) can run to make sure that the markdown in the document conforms with the reference implementation. This could also include basic checks for required metadata (title, author, publication date, etc.), and could optionally validate the citations as well.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2013-06-19T17:13:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the comments on <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">Monday’s blog post</a> about the Markdown for Science workshop, <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettiger</a> had some good arguments against the proposal for how to do <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/citations">citations</a> that we came up with during the workshop. As this is a complex topic, I decided to write this blog post.</p><p>Citations of the scholarly literature are an essential part of scholarly texts and therefore have to be supported by scholarly markdown. Both the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide">Multimarkdown</a> flavors of markdown support citations, using a bibtex file that contains citations, placeholders for citekeys – <code>[@smith04]</code> for Pandoc and <code>[#smith04]</code> for Multimarkdown – and the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a> for citation formatting (Pandoc). A very reasonable approach would therefore be to use this functionality, with a preference for Pandoc because of the Citation Style Language support. All reference managers can export to the bibtex format, and some of them (e.g. <a href="http://www.papersapp.com/papers/">Papers</a>) make it very easy to copy and paste citekeys.</p><p>Ten days after the workshop I’m not so sure anymore this is the best approach. For four reasons:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>YFNS</strong></strong>. This approach failed the YFNS (your friendly neighborhood scientist) test. We came up with this term during the workshop and it means that our ideas about authoring should make sense to the workflow of the average scientist. I thought that using citekeys is a good idea, but my wife (my YFNS) tells me that she never uses citekeys because there are just too many <code>[@smith04]</code>, and it is too easy get out of sync with the reference manager. She therefore prefers to put the complete reference information into the text while writing.</li><li><strong><strong>Snippets</strong></strong>. As I said <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">previously</a>, I think that scholarly markdown has great potential not so much for writing full papers, but for all the little scientific documents we write on a daily basis. For this reason the citation information should ideally be embedded in the document if it is short, and that is difficult with bibtex (which is not human-readable).</li><li><strong><strong>Citations as links</strong></strong>. Carl Boettiger reminded me that I wrote a <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/citations-are-links-so-where-is-the-problem/">blog post in 2010</a> stating that citations are nothing else than links, and that we should treat them accordingly. He has written a tool (<a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</a>) for R that does just that, and Phil Lord and colleagues have written a similar tool (<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</a>) for Wordpress. In 2010 I wrote a tool for Wordpress (<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/link-to-link/">Link to Link</a>) that takes a different approach but also treats citations as links. All that we need is the DOI (or URL) for the article.</li><li><strong><strong>Vendor lock-in</strong></strong>. Although a number of excellent reference managers are available now, users are still limited in their choices because everyone has to use the same reference manager when multiple authors work on the same document. This has always annoyed me. It would no longer be the case if we embed the citation information in the document in a standard format.</li></ol><p>Part of the motivation for using scholarly markdown is that we can come up with best practices that make sense for digital content and don’t need to support conventions from an era when articles were still printed on paper. Reference information in the form of volumes and pages, and 1000s of citation styles certainly have outlived their purpose. Citation styles are a particular pain point, as they are nothing more than a visual representation of a citation - we should care much more about the machine-readable metadata, in particular the DOI or other identifier.</p><p>The best practice for scholarly markdown could therefore be to treat citations as links, using DOIs or other standard identifiers (PMID, ArXiV, etc.) where possible. Because we typically want to list the citations as references at the end of the document, reference-style links should be preferred over inline links. From the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">markdown syntax documentation</a>:</p><pre><code>This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.
[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"</code></pre><p>It might be tempting to use sequential numbers as id for the reference-style links, but the order of links can of course change during writing. It may make sense to think of the id in reference-style links as a citekey, and people should be free use that functionality of their reference manager. The citekey is used to link to the reference list at the bottom of the document, different from linking to the citekey in a separate bibtex file.</p><p>All of the above can be done in any text editor. This also includes the text editor that scholars spend most of their time with - their email program. Reference-style citations in an email are very readable, and also actionable since they are links and not text with bibliographic information.</p><p>One problem with this approach is of course that all links are inline in the resulting HTML, without a references section at the end of the document. This may be fine, as we can provide citation information in the title attribute, available upon hovering over the link (try hovering over <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">this link</a>, the journal eLife is doing <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00633">something similar</a>). The markdown could look like this (using the <em>Vancouver</em> citation style):</p><pre><code>[@Ioannidis2005]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 "Ioannidis JPA. Why Most Published Research Findings Are False. PLoS Medicine. Public Library of Science; 2005;2(8):e124. Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124"</code></pre><p>The title attribute now of course uses a citation style, but this is optional information and can easily be reformatted as we have the DOI.</p><p>Or we break away from standard markdown and display reference-style links at the end of the document - similar to <a href="http://rephrase.net/box/word/footnotes/syntax/">footnotes</a>, which are also not part of standard markdown. But this is just a display issue that can be solved, and the solution might look different depending on whether the output is HTML, PDF or XML. This document for example contains 14 reference-style citations.</p><p>There is obviously a need for tools that make adding citations to scholarly markdown easier. This could be accomplished by relatively small changes to existing reference managers (enabling copy/paste of citations in reference-style markdown format), or by tools similar to the <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</a> mentioned above.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2013-06-17T17:16:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the important discussions taking place at the <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki">Markdown for Science</a> workshop last weekend was about the definition of Scholarly Markdown. We came up with <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">this</a>:</p><ol><li>Markdown that supports the requirements of scientific texts</li><li>Markdown as format that glues open scientific text resources together</li><li>A reference implementation with documentation and tests</li><li>A community</li></ol><p>We also agreed that <strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong> is a better term than <strong><strong>Markdown for Science</strong></strong>, as it also includes the Social Sciences and Humanities. And we agreed on a hashtag, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scholmd&amp;src=typd">#scholmd</a>.</p><p>I like #3 and #4, and I was not surprised to see #1. #2 is one of the most important outcomes of the workshop for me personally, and was reflected in the discussion we had in the breakout session on <em>What is needed for Markdown to be adopted by the scientific community?</em> One important strategy is the following:</p><blockquote>We need an online tool that makes it easy for scholars to write scholarly markdown in a collaborative manner.</blockquote><p>We called this the <strong><strong>Google Docs for Scientists</strong></strong> (Google Docs is a good collaborative tool, but is lacking some important features required for scientific documents, e.g. integrated citation management). <a href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</a> was mentioned as a promising example of this concept. It was also noted that some previous efforts failed, because the tool looked too different from Microsoft Word. But building such a tool wouldn’t really require markdown as a file format, and could for example also be done directly in HTML5. This would be a reasonable strategy, but in my mind is falling short because I think the problem we need to solve is more complicated than making collaboration easier with tools that look like Microsoft Word. We therefore also discussed a different strategy:</p><blockquote>We need multiple tools that make it easy for scholars to create scholarly markdown documents and openly share them. This collaborative work is not limited to authoring scholarly papers, but also includes shorter scholarly texts, e.g. experimental results, lab notebooks, lecture notes, blog posts and working papers. Ease of use is not only defined by the writing experience, but also how easy it is to share documents with others.</blockquote><p>This definition almost sounds like a definition for Open Science, and assumes that data - and increasingly software - are an integral part of reporting science. This makes <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/reproducibility">reproducibility</a> of scientific results much easier, and one nice example how this can be done is the integration of markdown into the R statistical software, using the <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr package</a>. Using the <a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/plos-alm-data/">May 2013 PLOS article-level metrics data</a> which are freely available for download, the R code below can be embedded into a markdown file and will produce the bar plot below when the markdown file is run in R (to try this yourself, download the ALM data and <a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/plosOpenR/blob/master/barPlotSummary.Rmd">markdown file for this article</a>).</p><pre><code># Load required libraries

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the last <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner">Gobbledygook</a> post on PLOS Blogs, and at the same time the first post at the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/">new Github blog location</a>. I have been blogging at PLOS Blogs since the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/blogosphere/">PLOS Blogs Network</a> was launched in September 2010, so this step wasn’t easy. But I have two good reasons.</p><p>In May 2012 I started to work as technical lead for the <a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics</a> project. Although this is contract work, and I also do other things - including spending 5% of my time as clinical researcher at Hannover Medical School - this created the awkward situation that I was never quite sure whether I was blogging as Martin Fenner or as someone working for PLOS. This was all in my head, as I never had any restrictions in my blogging from PLOS. With the recent launch of the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/">PLOS Tech Blog</a> there is now a good venue for the kind of topics I like to write about, and I have started to work on two posts for this new blog.</p><p>There will always be topics for which the PLOS Tech Blog is not a good fit, and for these posts I have launched the new personal blog at Github. But the main reason for this new blog is a technical one: I’m moving away from blogging on Wordpress to writing my posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> (a lightweight markup language), that are then transformed into static HTML pages using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>. Last weekend I co-organized the workshop <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki"><strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong></a> together with <a href="http://twitter.com/houshuang">Stian Håklev</a>. A full workshop report will follow in another post, but the discussions before, at and after the workshop convinced me that <strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong> has a bright future and that it is time to move more of my writing to markdown. At the end of the workshop each participant suggested a <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki/Todo-list-from-workshop">todo item</a> that he/she would be working on, and my todo item was “Think about document type where MD shines”. Markdown might be good for writing scientific papers, but I think it really shines in shorter scientific documents that can easily be shared with others. And blog posts are a perfect fit.</p><p>The new site is work in progress. Over time I will copy over all old blog posts from PLOS Blogs, and will work on the layout as well as additional features. Special thanks to <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettiger</a> for helping me to get started with Jekyll and Github pages.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week re3data.org – the Registry of Research Data Repositories – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://www.re3data.org/2013/05/re3data-org-launched/">officially launched</a>.

In my opinion it is not enough to provide lists of research data repositories, we need additional information that can help guide researchers in selecting an appropriate research data repository. re3data.org has addressed this nicely by providing a <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/re3data-org-registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched/10.2312/re3.002">vocabulary for the registration and description of research data repositories</a>, and by creating a simple icon system:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/figure2.png" class="kg-image" alt="The re3data icon system" loading="lazy" width="500" height="569"></figure><p><em>Possible values for each icon.

Whether or not scientific infrastructure such as re3data.org is accepted and used by the community depends on many factors, and governance is one of the most important ones. re3data.org should seek the support of other organizations, in particular from outside Germany. A governing board, re3data.org as an independent organization, and strategies to coordinate with similar efforts such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://www.databib.org/">Databib</a> are possible strategies.</li></ul>]]></content>

Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Bicycle_in_Oxford.JPG">Wikimedia Commons</a></figcaption></figure><p>This Thursday I take part in a panel discussion at the <a href="http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013">Joint ORCID – Dryad Symposium on Research Attribution</a>. Together with <a href="http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/editorial-staff/trish-groves">Trish Groves</a> (BMJ) and <a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/cborgman/Chriss_Site/Welcome.html">Christine Borgman</a> (UCLA) I will discuss several aspects of attribution. Trish will speak about ethics, Christine will highlight problems, and I will add my perspective on metrics. This blog post summarizes the main points I want to make.</p><p>Scholarly metrics can be used in discovery tools, as business intelligence for funders, research organizations or publishers, and for research assessment. For all these scenarios – and in particular for research assessment – it is important to not only collect metrics for a particular journal publication, dataset or other research output, but to also link these metrics to the creators of that research output.  That is why unique identifiers for researchers, and ORCID in particular, are so important for scholarly metrics, and this is also reflected in the ORCID membership of organizations such as Thomson Reuters, Elsevier/Scopus, Altmetric or F1000Prime who provide metrics in a variety of ways.</p><h2 id="dora">DORA</h2><p>A good starting point for any discussion on metrics for research assessment is the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (<a href="https://sfdora.org">DORA</a>) that was published las week, together with a set of editorials in several journals, including the <em><a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/early/2013/05/14/jcb.201304162.full">Journal of Cell Biology</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/24/10/1505.full">Molecular Biology of the Cell</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/emboj/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/emboj2013126a.html">EMBO Journal</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/787">Science</a></em>, <em><a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/early/2013/05/09/jcs.134460.full.pdf+html">Journal of Cell Science</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/elife/2/e00855.full.pdf">eLife</a></em>. The first three recommendations are a good starting point for the panel discussion:</p><ol><li><em>Do not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions.</em></li><li><em>Be explicit about the criteria used in evaluating the scientific productivity of grant applicants and clearly highlight, especially for early-stage investigators, that the scientific content of a paper is much more important than publication metrics or the identity of the journal in which it was published.</em></li><li><em>For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.</em></li></ol><h2 id="persistent-identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</h2><p>Before we can collect any metrics, we need persistent identifiers for research outputs. Most journal articles now come with a DOI, but we should make it easier for smaller publishers to use DOIs, as cost unfortunately is still an issue.</p><p>Persistent identifiers for data are a much more complex issue, as there a number of persistent identifiers out there (including DOIs, handles, ARKs and purls), in addition to all the domain-specific identifiers, e.g. for nucleotide sequence or protein structures. DataCite DOIs are probably the first choice for attribution, as this is their main use case and they have features that make attribution easier (e.g. familiar to researchers, funders and publishers, global resolver). There are many other use cases for identifiers for data (e.g. to identify temporary datasets in an ongoing experiment), and is of course possible to use several identifiers for the same dataset. CrossRef is of course also issuing DOIs for datasets on behalf of their members, and the publisher PLOS is for example using CrossRef <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">component DOIs</a> for figures and supplementary information associated with a journal article, and is <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2013/01/easier-access-to-plos-data/">making them available via figshare</a>.</p><p>Particular challenges with persistent identifiers for research data include different versions of a dataset, and aggregation of datasets (e.g. whether we want to cite the aggregate dataset, or a particular subset). Persistent identifiers for other research outputs are an even bigger challenge, e.g. how to uniquely identify scientific software.</p><p>In addition to persistent identifiers for research outputs, we also need persistent identifiers for researchers. ORCID is obviously a good candidate, as it focusses on attribution (by allowing researchers to claim their research outputs and by integration in many researcher workflows). But it is clear that ORCID is not the only persistent identifiers for researchers, and that we need to link these identifiers, e.g. <a href="https://orcid.org/blog/2013/04/22/orcid-and-isni-issue-joint-statement-interoperation-april-2013">ORCID and ISNI</a>.</p><p>Depending on how we want to aggregate the metrics we are interested in, we might also need persistent identifiers for institutions, for funding agencies and their grant IDs, and for resources such as particle accelerators or research vessels. Unfortunately much more work is needed in these areas.</p><h2 id="attribution">Attribution</h2><p>Attribution is then the next step, linking persistent identifiers for research outputs to their creators. Attribution is therefore essential for research assessment. The <a href="https://www.force11.org/AmsterdamManifesto">Amsterdam Manifesto on Data Citation Principles</a> that came out of the Beyond the PDF 2 workshop in March are an excellent document, but are unfortunately missing the important step of linking persistent identifiers for data to the persistent identifiers of their creators.</p><p>One important issue related to attribution is the provenance of the claims. Has a researcher claimed authorship for a particular paper, is a data center linking creators to research data, or is a funder doing this? The ORCID registry is built around the concept of self-claims by authors, but will allow the other stakeholders to confirm these claims.</p><h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2><p>Metrics for scholarly content fall into one of three categories:</p><ul><li>Citations</li><li>Usage stats</li><li>Altmetrics</li></ul><p>Altmetrics is a mixed bag of many different things, from sharing on social media such as Twitter or Facebook to more scholarly activities such as Mendeley bookmarks or F1000Prime reviews. I therefore expect the altmetrics category to over time further evolve into 2-3 sub-categories.</p><p>We are all familiar with citation-based metrics for journal articles. We currently see the long-overdue shift from journal-based citation metrics to article-level metrics (see #1 from the DORA statement above for the reasoning), and as the technical lead for the PLOS Article-Level Metrics project I of course welcome this shift in focus. We also see a trend towards opening up reference lists that will make citation-based metrics much more accessible, and the <a href="http://opencitations.net/">JISC Open Citations</a> project by David Shotton and others is an important driver in this, as is the <a href="http://openbiblio.net/">Open Bibliographic Data</a> project by OKFN. Until open bibliographic data become the norm, we have to deal with different citation counts from different sources. PLOS is collecting citations from Web of Science, Scopus, CrossRef and PubMed Central, and the citation counts are highly correlated overall (e.g. R2= 0.87 for CrossRef and Scopus citations for 2009 PLOS Biology papers), but for some papers differ substantially. Similar to persistent identifiers, reference lists of publications should become part of the open e-infrastructure for science and not depend on proprietary systems. This makes citation metrics more transparent and easier to compare, and fosters research and innovation, in particular by smaller organizations.</p><p>The data citation community has adopted the journal article citation model, and we are starting to see more citations to datasets. Even though data citations look similar to citations of journal articles, many essential tools and services still don’t properly handle datasets. The <a href="http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/">Web of Knowledge Data Citation Index</a> is an important step in the right direction, as is the<a href="http://odin-project.eu/2013/05/13/new-orcid-integrated-data-citation-tool/"> new DataCite import tool for ORCID</a>. Something that we should pay closer attention to is the citation counts of the paper(s) associated with a dataset. Maybe the major scientific impact is in the data, but scientific practice still dictates to the cite the corresponding paper and not the dataset itself (one of the reasons we see data journals being launched). The DataCite metadata can contain the persistent identifier of the corresponding journal article, thus making it possible to associate the citation count of the corresponding paper with the dataset. This approach is particularly important for datasets that are always part of a paper, as is the case for Dryad. One important consideration is that contributor lists may differ between journal article and dataset, or between related datasets.</p><p>Another problem with data citation is that citation counts might not be the best way to reflect the scientific impact of a dataset. We are increasingly seeing usage stats for datasets, and DataCite for example has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.datacite.org/node/76">started in January</a> to publish monthly stats for the most popular datasets by number of DOI resolutions. The #1 dataset in March was the raw data to a figure in a F1000Research article, <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Figure_7_raw_data_Effect_of_variable_exposure_to_PTHrP_1_36_on_bone_nodules_and_AP_activity_in_high_plating_density_cultures_/154685">hosted on figshare</a>.</p><p>Similar to citations we see a strong trend for usage stats to move from aggregate numbers for journals to article-level metrics. COUNTER has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.projectcounter.org/pirus.html">released</a> a draft code of practice for their PIRUS (Publisher and Institutional Repository Usage Statistics) standard in February, and increasing numbers of publishers and repository infrastructure providers such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.irus.mimas.ac.uk/">IRUS-UK</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english">OA-Statistics</a> are providing usage stats for individual articles.</p><p>One challenge with usage stats, in particular with Open Access content, is that an article or other research output might be available in more than one place, e.g. publisher (or data center), disciplinary repository and institutional repository. For PLOS articles we don’t know the aggregated usage stats from institutional repositories, but we know that 17% of HTML pageviews and 33% of PDF downloads happen not at the PLOS website, but at PubMed Central.</p><p>Altmetrics provide new challenges, but they are also a more recent development compared to usage stats and citations. Similar to usage stats they are easier to game than citations, and for some altmetrics sources (e.g. Twitter) standardization is still difficult. Altmetrics not necessarily measure impact, but sometimes rather reflect attention or self-promotion. We have just started to look into altmetrics beyond the numbers, e.g. who is tweeting, bookmarking or discussing a paper or dataset. Altmetrics provide the opportunity to show the broader social impact (as Mike Taylor from Elsevier explains it) of research, e.g. changing clinical practice or policies.</p><h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2><p>One important aspect to attribution is contribution, i.e. what is the specific contribution by a researcher to a paper or other research output. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/attribution_workshop">International Workshop on Contributorship and Scholarly Attribution</a> was held together with the May 2012 ORCID Outreach Meeting to discuss this topic. Authorship position (e.g. first author, last author) is used in some metrics, but overall the contributor role is still poorly appreciated in most metrics. David Shotton has proposed a <a href="http://purl.org/spar/scoro/Shotton_SCoRO_and_SCoRF_Contributions-Workshop_Harvard_16May2012.pdf">Scholarly Contributions and Roles Ontology</a> (ScoRO), and is suggesting to split authorship credit in percentage points based on relative contributions, but I haven’t seen these numbers used in the context of metrics.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>Persistent identifiers for people, attribution and metrics are closely interrelated and we have seen a lot of exciting developments in this area in the last two years. The widespread adoption of ORCID identifiers by the research community will have a huge impact on scholarly metrics. But with all the excitement we should never forget that a) there will never be a single metric that can be used for research assessment, and b) that scientific content will always be more important than any metric. I look forward to a great panel discussions on Thursday, and welcome any feedback via comments, Twitter or email.</p><p><em>May 23, 2013: Post updated with minor corrections and additions.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday June 8th – exactly a month from today – the PLOS San Francisco offices will host a workshop/hackathon about using markdown for science. A lot of people are experimenting with markdown for authoring scientific articles – see blog posts <a href="http://blog.yoavram.com/markx/">here</a>, <a href="http://inundata.org/2012/06/01/markdown-and-the-future-of-collaborative-manuscript-writing/">here</a> or my post <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">here</a>, and the scientific manuscript <a href="https://github.com/weecology/data-sharing-paper/">here</a>.</p><p>Markdown is a simple markup language for text, and is primarily used for HTML content on the web, but can also be converted to PDF, LaTeX and others. One challenge with markdown is that there are a number of slightly different “flavors” out there, from the original markdown to multimarkdown, github-flavored markdown and pandoc. Some of the advanced formatting of scientific documents – tables, citations, math – is still a challenge for markdown.</p><p>Will markdown become our next authoring format for scientific content? Will there be yet another flavor, scholarly markdown? How will markdown writing tools be different from LaTeX tools or Microsoft Word? If you care about any of these questions and are in or near San Francisco, join us on for all full day on June 8th. Free registration is open at <a href="http://mdsci13.eventbrite.com/">http://mdsci13.eventbrite.com</a>. We are collecting workshop ideas at <a href="https://github.com/karthikram/markdown_science/wiki/workshop">https://github.com/karthikram/markdown_science/wiki/workshop</a>, the Twitter hashtag is #mdsci13.</p><p>This event is organized by <a href="http://twitter.com/houshuang">Stian Håklev</a> and myself, with generous support by a <a href="http://www.force11.org/node/4358">1K Challenge prize from Force11</a>, and hosting provided by PLOS.</p>]]></content>

Two important concepts are a) to track metrics for individual scholarly articles instead of using numbers aggregated by journal, and b) to go beyond citations and also include usage stats and altmetrics.</p><p>Article-Level Metrics is also doing something else: instead of tracking impact by year, it looks at usage, altmetrics and citations in real-time. There might have been technical reasons to do so 20 years ago, but there really is no longer any reason why scholarly impact should be tracked on a yearly basis in 2013. Unfortunately there is one big stumbling block:</p><blockquote><em><em>The publication date of a scholarly article is often difficult or impossible to obtain. Publication year may be the only available information.</em></em></blockquote><p>A good example is CrossRef. They provide a lot of interesting metadata about an article and make this information available in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102027/http://search.crossref.org/">a very nice search interface</a>. But they only require the publisher to provide the publication year, information about the publication month and day is optional. There are many other examples of journals and services that just can’t tell you when exactly an article was published. This might have made sense when periodicals were printed on paper, but doesn’t work for digital content.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cameron Neylon yesterday wrote a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://cameronneylon.net/blog/whats-the-right-model-for-shared-scholarly-communications-infrastructure/"> great blog post</a> about appropriate business models for shared scholarly communications infrastructure. This is an area I have also been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2013/03/20/the-price-of-innovation-my-thoughts-for-beyond-the-pdf/">thinking about a lot recently</a>, and in this post I want to add a technical perspective (and an announcement) to the discussion.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> is an important trend that brings software development and administration of IT infrastructure closer together. Agile software development, server virtualization, cloud infrastructure and software automation tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://cfengine.com/">CFEngine</a> are an important pars of DevOps, but it is really the collaborative aspect of IT administrators working much closer with software developers what defines DevOps. The end result is often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://readwrite.com/2013/03/27/devops-booms-in-the-enterprise">faster and more stable software releases</a>, and that is what is users and customers care about.</p><p>This makes DevOps particularly relevant for all areas where innovation is important, and that of course includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://science.okfn.org/tools-for-open-science/">tools and services for Open Science</a>. We not only need infrastructure that facilitates software development (with services like Github, among many others), but we also have to streamline IT administration. The question is not whether you do your development in Java, Python, Ruby, PHP or Javascript, but how well you integrate your software development and IT administration. The shift towards web-based tools has centralized software installation and updates, but these web-based services are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to set up and administer. Running an institutional respository, research information system or a journal is a complex task. The software may be freely available as open source (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.dspace.org/">Dspace</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://vivoweb.org/">VIVO</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">Open Journal Systems</a>), but the resources required to run such a service still make this a big investment.</p><p>Two solutions to this dilemma are to pay either a vendor for installation and maintenance, or to use the software as a service (SaaS) that is hosted somewhere else. Why these two options are popular, they may not always be the best choices because they mean that you are locked in to a particular vendor or service provider, and that you may give expertise and direct access to your data away. I believe that these are helpful approaches for auxillary services, but that ideally the core services of a library, publisher or other provider of scientific infrastructure should not be outsourced. Developing software for scientific infrastructure that you want organizations to install locally should therefore always include work on integration with IT infrastructure, and just providing manual installation instructions isn’t good enough anymore.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/article-level-metrics/">Article-Level Metrics</a> (ALM) and the related altmetrics are becoming increasingly popular. The collection and display of this information is a complex process, as it requires the integration of information from several upstream APIs which may be temporarily unavailable, have changed their data format, or put up restrictions on how you can use the data. In turn this information has to be processed and aggregated, and then reliably be provided to downstream users. This kind of information gathering fits perfectly with a service provider model, and organizations such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.altmetric.com/">Altmetric</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.plumanalytics.com/">Plum Analytics</a>. PLOS is collecting and displaying this information with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">its own tool</a>. The simple reason is that PLOS started doing this several years before the services above became available, and none of them currently provide the same comprehensive set of information about citations, usage stats and altmetrics (although there are of course a lot of things they do better than the PLOS ALM application).</p><p>But there is also the question of whether Article-Level Metrics are a core service for every publisher and are best collected in-house. This not only makes it easier to collect information from some sources (e.g. usage stats or CrossRef citations), but also gives unrestricted access to the data in real-time. When I took over as technical lead for the PLOS Article-Level Metrics project last May, I therefore not only worked on improving the ALM application for PLOS, but we are also working hard on making it easier for other publishers to install and use the application. We want to provide an attractive alternative for organizations for which the service provider model is not the best option.</p><p>To that end I want to announce the latest feature which allows the automated installation of the PLOS ALM application on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance. This option is great not only for setting up an ALM production service, but because of the EC2 pricing model by hour (about $1 a day for a small EC2 instance) without setup costs is a great way to test-drive the application for a publisher, to analyze a particular set of papers from different publishers for a research project, or to set up a PLOS ALM server for a hackathon or workshop.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2013/04/vagrant_aws.png" class="kg-image" alt="vagrant_aws" loading="lazy"></figure><p>There are of course many options to automate software deployment on a production server, including the PaaS (platform as a service) providers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">CloudFoundry</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, and the recently announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://aws.amazon.com/de/opsworks/">Amazon OpsWorks</a>. I am a big fan of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> software development tool in combination with Chef for automation, and in March Vagrant added <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html">support for Amazon AWS</a>. This makes deployment of the PLOS ALM application to AWS really simple:</p><ol><li>Install Vagrant and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws">vagrant-aws plugin</a></li><li>Setup an Amazon Web Services Account</li><li>Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">PLOS ALM source code</a> from Github</li><li>run the command <strong>vagrant up –provider aws</strong></li></ol><p>Step #4 took 898 sec or about 15 min on my computer (see screenshot), and at the end I had a PLOS ALM server where I could access the admin dashboard via the web interface. If you are familiar with Amazon Web Services – you have to think about  the right size for the EC2 instance, an appropriate AMI, security groups, elastic IPs, and DNS service – then the whole process should be done in well under an hour. I will use this instance to load and analyze some articles from a publisher for a presentation next week. When I’m done, another command (<strong>vagrant destroy</strong>) will destroy this server and Amazon will stop billing me. During testing I have created and destroyed many servers, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html">vagrant-aws video</a> shows you how easy this process is.</p><p>At this stage the installation process is working (and has been working for a local Virtualbox install for many months), but needs testing and documentation. I therefore invite everyone interested in testing this out to contact me so that we can make this well-documented and working reliably.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/comment-the-case-for-open-preprints-in-biology"/>
        <updated>2013-03-30T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week Philippe Desjardins-Prouly et al. published the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.655710">The case for open preprints in biology</a> – naturally as a preprint on figshare. The article sees preprint servers as a great opportunity for open science, and discusses the status of preprints in the biological sciences. In this blog post I want to add some comments to the text.</p><h2 id="e-biomed">E-BIOMED</h2><p>What is now PubMed Central <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.nih.gov/about/director/pubmedcentral/ebiomedarch.htm">started out as E-BIOMED in 1999</a> and initially was envisioned to include a repository for preprints. It is important to look back at what happened then, and why the preprint repository was dropped from what then became PubMed Central. Harold Varmus talks a bit about this in this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://poynder.blogspot.de/2006/06/interview-with-harold-varmus.html">interview</a> from 2006.</p><h2 id="nature-precedings">Nature Precedings</h2><p>The article talks about why biologists have not developed a culture of sharing preprints. It would be good to mention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>, a preprint server for the life sciences started in 2007 that stopped taking new submissions in 2012. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/nature-precedings-to-stop-accepting-submissions-next-week-after-finding-model-unsustainable/">This blog post</a> on RetractionWatch cites the announcement by Nature Publishing Group (which doesn’t explain why the service was shut down), and there are a good number of interesting comments.</p><h2 id="ssrn">SSRN</h2><p>Preprints in other disciplines are mentioned in the text, in particular ArXiv, but also RePEc. I would also include <strong>SSRN</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.ssrn.com/">Social Science Research Network</a>), which uses a different model, but is as important for the working paper and preprint culture in the social sciences as ArXiV is in physics/mathematics.</p><h2 id="google-scholar-metrics">Google Scholar Metrics</h2><p>In April 2012 Google launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=en">Google Scholar Metrics</a>, listing the top 100 publications (according to their h5-index) in several disciplines. Six out of the top 10 publications in physics/mathematics are ArXiV sections (arXiv Astrophysics (astro-ph) is #2), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers">IZA Discussion Papers</a> are #1 in Social Sciences, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.nber.org/papers.html">NBER Working Papers</a> are #1 in Economics, and arXiv Astrophysics (astro-ph) is #12 on the top 100 list for all disciplines (#1-5 are journals in biology and medicine: <em>Nature</em>, <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>Lancet</em>, <em>Cell</em>). All these metrics are a strong indicator that preprints can be highly cited.</p><h2 id="citation-advantage-of-preprints">Citation Advantage of Preprints</h2><p>Anne Gentil-Beccot et al. have written a nice paper (of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418">available as preprint</a>) that shows that publication as preprint now only increases the citation rate for the corresponding peer-reviewed article published later, but also leads to much faster citations, with a peak immediately after publication.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/gentil-beccot.png" class="kg-image" alt="gentil-beccot" loading="lazy" width="500" height="319"><figcaption>Average number of citations per article per month as a function of the time of the citation relative to the time of publication. From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418">http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="scoap3">SCOAP3</h2><p>The Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publications in High Energy Physics (<a href="https://scoap3.org/">SCOAP3</a>) is working on turning the majority of peer-reviewed publications in high energy physics into gold open access. It is important to understand that the high energy physics community feels that they need peer-reviewed journal articles in addition to ArXiv.</p><h2 id="preprint-culture-in-clinical-medicine">Preprint Culture in Clinical Medicine</h2><p>It is a little known fact that there is a strong preprint culture in clinical medicine. I have written about this topic in <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">October 2010</a>. Clinical trials have to be registered before starting the trial, and information about the trial is publicly available in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</a> and other registries. Results are presented in conferences (as poster or oral presentation), at which stage it becomes public information. The peer-reviewed paper – with a few exceptions – follows much later, sometimes even after drug approval by the FDA (in the blog post I used the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61389-X">TROPIC</a> trial as example). The problem is of course that information in oral presentations and posters is incomplete and difficult to find. But publication of a clinical trial in a peer-reviewed journal is more about giving credit to the researchers involved (similar to SCOAP3 in high energy physics) than about spreading the knowledge. Peer review is not an appropriate filter for whether or not a new drug or drug combination should be used to treat patients – the approval process by regulatory authorities is much more extensive than any peer review can ever be.</p><h2 id="preprint-culture-in-biology">Preprint culture in Biology</h2><p>The paper mentions several reasons why the field of biology has essentially no preprint culture. One argument against preprints is that it would be easier to steal ideas. Although I agree with the authors that preprints are a great way to establish precedence, there is a big difference between research based on years of work using expensive equipment (as is often the case in high energy physics but also some other fields), and research that can be reproduced in a few weeks. In the latter case it is possible that someone else is faster in publishing the peer-reviewed paper. Another difference is the community: “stealing” ideas from someone else is probably more difficult in smaller scientific communities, and some scientific communities are more competitive and less collaborative than others.</p><p>Another concern about preprints raised in the paper is the Ingelfinger rule, i.e. the uncertainty that a journal would accept a manuscript if already published as a preprint. This concern is fortunately unfounded regarding most publishers, and the paper includes a table listing the preprint policies of important publishers in biology.</p><p>I would like to add two other reasons why the preprint culture is probably not established in biology. Preprints are competition for the peer-reviewed journal article and scholarly publishers might not be particularly interested in encouraging a preprint culture. A lot has fortunately changed since E-BIOMED in 1999.</p><p>Finally, whereas some disciplines use preprints and working papers to communicate, in biology the preferred way to communicate research findings before publication of a peer-reviewed paper is the oral presentation. What we may need is a service that makes it easy to upload and share scientific presentations. We for example already have Slideshare, Speaker Deck as generic tools, and SciVee, figshare aimed at scientists. Speaker Deck <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/speaker-deck-for-sharing-presentations/">is currently my favorite tool</a> and is a Github product (Github has been mentioned in the manuscript as an option for hosting preprints). Maybe what is missing is a killer combination of features in a new or existing service – persistent identifiers, uploading of background material (text, data, software, video) in addition to the slides, non-textual search, cooperation with conference organizers, etc. – for presentation sharing to take off as a way to establish a preprint culture in biology.</p><p><em>Update 4/4/13: Yesterday PeerJ launched a new preprint service for life sciences research. Read <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/04/03/who-killed-the-preprint-and-could-it-make-a-return/">this blog post</a> for details, and this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://blog.mendeley.com/open-access/is-the-time-right-for-a-preprint-server-for-life-science/">post</a> on the Mendeley blog.</em></p>]]></content>

We also see a few spikes in the usage stats, probably indicating events that triggered usage. Academic bookmarking was most active from 2009 to 2011 and not right after publication, although that might also have to do with the relative popularity of CiteULike over time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sparklines5-500x262.png" class="kg-image" alt="sparklines5" loading="lazy" width="500" height="262"><figcaption>CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article <strong>Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</strong> by month, available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Citation data are unfortunately more difficult to get with exact publication dates (why is that so difficult?), but we can at least look at CrossRef numbers by year for the same article.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sparklines31-e1364340861413.png" class="kg-image" alt="sparklines3" loading="lazy" width="200" height="169"><figcaption>CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article <strong>Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</strong> by year, available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The citation numbers by year are still increasing (the last bar is for 2013), indicating that this article is still of general interest 8 years after publication.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the journal <em>Nature</em> has released a special on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155331/http://www.nature.com/news/specials/scipublishing/index.html">Future of Publishing</a>. It includes a lot of interesting reading, but I want to focus on the comment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155331/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/495437a">Beyond the Paper</a> by Jason Priem. In the comment Jason describes his vision of the future of scholarly communication, a future where many of today’s roles for articles and journals will be replaced by the <em>decoupled journal</em> and online tools taking the lead in dissemination and filtering of scholarly content.</p><p>Jason makes a strong case for this vision, and takes his time to also discuss the concerns and challenges. He doesn’t have the space to discuss in more detail how we get to that future, and in particular what the role of researchers, publishers, libraries and funders be in that transition.</p><p>Jason’s vision will probably be overwhelming for many researchers, and might not directly address what is probably the biggest issue for most researchers: funding for grants and jobs is limited, and the processes we use to select for good science and good scientists are inefficient and often arbitrary. Most students entering graduate school will not be able to have a career in academia, and most academics will say that they spend far too much time with evaluations – of their own work and the work of others. It is unclear to me how we can get from the current system – where one misstep such as denied grant or submission to the wrong journal can mean the end of a career – to the system that Jason envisions. The current climate doesn’t really foster experimentation by researchers and I am interested to understand how researchers can take part in this process of change.</p><p>The vision of the decoupled journal is very threatening for some of the stakeholders of the current scholarly communication ecosystem, in particular publishers and libraries. Every journal publisher and library knows that it has to reinvent itself to survive the digital transformation, but a vision that is build around a new ecosystem of service providers needs to be clear how publishers and libraries can be part of the transformation process.</p><p>Lastly, I disagree with the notion that <em>today’s publication silos will be replaced by a set of decentralized, interoperable services that are built on a core infrastructure of open data and evolving standards — like the Web itself.</em> I would argue that both scholarly communication and the web in general have a tendency for centralization, and that scientific infrastructure needs to be interoperable first and decentralized second. Without a focus on interoperability the future of scholarly communication will not be open and in the hands of many, but will be a race to become one of the dominant players in this new ecosystem, and we might end up with not 1000s of libraries and publishers but just a handful of technology companies holding the keys to our scientific infrastructure.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Priem, J.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155123/http://www.force11.org/taxonomy/term/27">Beyond the PDF Conference</a> is currently taking place in Amsterdam. Unfortunately I am unable to attend in person this time (I took part in the first Beyond the PDF in January 2011), but I was watching the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155123/http://www.force11.org/beyondthepdf2/live">livestream</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155123/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2013/03/20/the-price-of-innovation-my-thoughts-for-beyond-the-pdf/ww.force11.org/Business_Case">Business Case</a> panel discussion yesterday afternoon.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/291798596_dbfcfc26d7_c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="the globe of science and innovation" loading="lazy" width="800" height="532"><figcaption>Globe of Science and Innovation at CERN, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155123/http://www.flickr.com/photos/nico_h/291798596/">Flickr photo</a> by <strong>nico h</strong>.</figcaption></figure><p>How to pay for the development of new scientific infrastructure and tools is something that I think a lot about science moving away from academia to become a developer of scientific software last year. I would assume three things:</p><ul><li>there are a lot of great ideas out there to improve scholarly communication</li><li>there is enough money out there to pay for improvements in scholarly communication</li><li>we are frustrated because progress is much slower than we anticipate</li></ul><p>If we have enough great ideas and enough money, but don’t see the results we expect, something must be going wrong. A simple answer would be that it is different people and organizations that have the ideas from those that have the money, but I don’t think that this is the reason. My suspicion is that there is a deeper problem, and that the approach we take to scholarly innovation is broken. Below is how innovation is approached by the major players:</p><ul><li>individual scientists and/or software developers come up with great ideas, but don’t get past the prototype stage because of limited resources</li><li>academic tools and infrastructure are built as part of a funded project (anywhere from 6 months to a few years), but there are no resources to turn this into a service that is persistent beyond the project</li><li>publishers and large academic institutions have the resources to build these tools. They are often less innovative because of their size</li><li>funders pay for projects (see above), but rarely for infrastructure, and they rarely get involved in innovative projects themselves</li><li>commercial organizations can quickly bring great ideas to market (in particular small startups), but it is often unclear how their services are paid for in the long run</li></ul><p>At the end of the day it seems that we have a lot of great ideas, but many of them never reach critical mass, and an even smaller number has long-term sustainability. I can think of a number of great projects that have never gained traction, and of a number of great tools and services where I have no idea how their development and service is paid for. The idea to get to a large number of users no matter what it costs, and figure out the business plan later is popular with internet startups, but dangerous when we care about tools we want to still use two years from now. Two projects that are not specific to science, but are important for science and have made this work are <strong>Wikipedia</strong> and <strong>Github</strong>. From the long list of tools for scientists I would not pick <strong>Mendeley</strong> or <strong>figshare</strong> (both great services, but still in search of sustainability), but <strong>ArXiV</strong> and <strong>Papers</strong>.It also doesn’t help that most scientists are a conservative bunch when it comes to technology, and that the scientific market is fairly small compared to the overall number of users. Another big challenge is to innovate in an open environment, i.e. to make the innovation available to as many people as possible without barriers of access. Some of my personal conclusions from all this are the following:</p><ul><li>we should acknowledge that we have an innovation problem, and it is not simply solved by getting more money</li><li>we have a collaboration problem, too many people are doing similar things without talking to each other and working together</li><li>scientific infrastructure and tools cost money. We need the right people to pay (ideally not the individual researcher), fair prices and intelligent business models</li><li>funders should reconsider how they pay for scientific infrastructure, as the project-based approach is broken</li><li>large organizations (commercial, non-commercial and academic) should think about their approach to innovation, in particular how they support innovation outside of their organization</li></ul><p>You can follow the Beyond the PDF <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155123/http://www.force11.org/beyondthepdf2/live">livestream</a> today or follow the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155123/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23btpdf2&amp;src=hash">#btpdf2</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Google announced that they will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://googleblog.blogspot.de/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">shut down Google Reader</a> July 1st. In a way this announcement didn’t surprise me, as my own use of RSS readers has gone down in favor of news readers such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/05/flipboard-plos-blogs-on-the-ipad/">Flipboard</a> and using Twitter as a discovery tool. And built-in support for RSS had slowly been depreciated in web browsers such as Firefox (version 4, 2011) and Safari (version 6, 2012).</p><p>Although RSS (and the related Atom) may never have caught on with the typical web user, it is an essential tool for scholarly content. It is the best format to subscribe to journal table of contents, much more suitable than email alerts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/">JournalTOCs</a> is a good place to get started, but most publishers prominently display the RSS icon. RSS is also great for searches you want to do regularly and is supported by PLOS, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/040_060.html">PubMed</a>, and others. Because it is a machine-readable format, it is also used by many websites to automatically read in article information. RSS feeds for journal table of contents differ in format, but CrossRef in 2009 has posted <a href="https://oxford.crossref.org/best_practice/rss/">recommendations</a> for publishers.</p><p>Google Reader is of course only one of many RSS readers, so this announcement shouldn’t have any immediate impact. Nevertheless it is probably another sign that the web is moving away from RSS, and that we should start to think about alternatives for distributing tables of content. Or that we should use different strategies for finding interesting articles that have recently been published, e.g. follow the article recommendations in your social network.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following up from <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">my post last week</a>, below is a suggested list of features that should be supported in documents written in scholarly markdown. Please provide feedback via the comments, or by editing the Wiki version I have set up <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/scholarly-markdown/wiki">here</a>. Listed are features that go beyond the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">standard markdown syntax</a>.</p><p>The goals of scholarly markdown are</p><ol><li>to support writing of complete scholarly articles,</li><li>don’t make the syntax more complicated than it is today, and</li><li>don’t rely on HTML as the fallback mechanism.</li></ol><p>In practice this means that scholarly markdown should support most, but not all scholarly texts – documents that are heavy in math formulas, have complicated tables, etc. may be better written with LaTeX or Microsoft Word. It also means that scholarly markdown will probably contain only limited semantic markup, as this is difficult to do with a lightweight markup language and much easier with XML or a binary file format.</p><h2 id="cover-page">Cover Page</h2><p>Optional metadata about a document. Typically used for title, authors (including affiliation), and publication date, but should be flexible enough to handle any kind of metadata (keywords, copyright, etc.).</p><pre><code>---

The external links (both scholarly identifiers such as DOIs and regular web URLs) are collected in a bibliography at the end of the document, and the citations in the text link to this bibliography. This functionality is similar to footnotes.</p><p>Citations should include a citation key in the text, e.g. <code>[@kowalczyk2011]</code>, parsed as (Kowalczyk &amp; Shankar, 2011), and a separate bibliography file in BibTeX (or RIS) format that contains references for all citations. Inserting citations and creating the bibliography can best be done with a reference manager.</p><p>Cross-links – i.e. links within a document – are important for scholarly texts.

Comments should be linked to a particular part of a document to provide context, or attached at the end of a document for general comments. It would also be helpful to “comment out” parts of a document, e.g. to indicate parts that are incomplete and need more work. Revisions of a markdown document are best handled using a version control system such as git.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Kowalczyk, S., &amp; Shankar, K. (2011).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber for writing content for the web. Other popular lightweight markup languages are Textile and Mediawiki. Whereas Mediawiki markup is of course popular thanks to the ubiquitous Wikipedia, Markdown seems to have gained momentum among scholars. Markdown really focuses on writing content, many of the features of today’s word processors are just a distraction (e.g. fonts, line spacing or style sheets). Adding markup for document structure (e.g. title, authors or abstract) on the other hand is overly complicated with tools such as Microsft Word.</p><p>Fortunately or unfortunately there are several versions (or flavors) of Markdown. The original specification by John Gruber hasn’t been updated for years. Github uses Markdown with some minor modifications. Multimarkdown and Pandoc provide features important for scholarly content, e.g. citations, superscript and tables.</p><ul><li>Markdown</li><li>Github-flavored Markdown</li><li>Multimarkdown</li><li>Pandoc</li></ul><p>The Pandoc flavor of Markdown probably comes closest to the requirements of a scholar, but still has limitations, e.g. support for metadata and tables isn’t very flexible. I propose that we as a community create a new Scholarly Markdown flavor, which takes into account most of the use cases important for scholarly content.</p><p>One of the big advantages of Markdown is that the format can not only be translated to HTML, but also to other formats, and Pandoc is particularly good in translating to and from many different formats. We want to make sure that Scholarly Markdown not only translates into nice Scholarly HTML (with good support for HTML5 tags relevant for scholars), but also into Microsot Word, LaTeX and PDF, as these are the formats typically required by manuscript tracking systems.</p><p>Some of the features required for Scholarly Markdown include:</p><ul><li>Superscript and subscript</li><li>Highlighting text (supporting the HTML tag <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>)</li><li>Captions for tables and figures (with support for the HTML tags <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>)</li><li>Support for document sections (the HTML5 tags <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>)</li><li>Good table support</li><li>Math support</li><li>Good citation support</li><li>Support for comments and annotations</li></ul><p>Multimarkdown and Pandoc of course already support many of these features. Tables and citations are two examples where it is important to not only support them, but support them in a non-intrusive way that doesn’t get in the way of the flow of writing.</p><p>BTW, this wouldn’t be the first community flavor for Markdown. The screenwriting community has done this already with <a href="http://fountain.io/">Fountain</a>.</p>]]></content>

I’m <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1419-2405">0000-0003-1419-2405</a>, and we put the ID (and the QR code linking to the profile on the ORCID website) on the name tags for the ORCID Outreach Meeting last Wednesday (Geek alert: I also have received a T-shirt with my name, ORCID and QR code).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/nametag-500x283.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="283"></figure><p>I was invited to work with ORCID in early 2010 after writing about the initiative that was started in November 2009 on this blog (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid_or_how_to_build_a_unique_identifier_for_scientists_in_10_easy_steps/">ORCID or how to build a unique identifier for scientists in 10 easy steps</a>). And now, after three years and a lot of work by a lot of people, ORCID is real and everyone can use the system. As a researcher, you can go to the ORCID website and register.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/orcid-500x445.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="445"></figure><p>Obtaining a number is of course not very interesting in itself, few people get excited about the fact of having a 16-digit unique identifier. What ORCID is really about is claiming your publications and other scholarly works, and <strong>Connecting Research and Researchers</strong> is the slogan of the organization. In the ORCID system you can now claim publications found in the CrossRef database, and other work types will be added over time.</p><p>What I’m particularly interested in is the claiming of research datasets. Everyone wants to give researchers better credit for the data they have produced, transformed and annotated, but data citation is still not a widespread practice. I am therefore very excited to be involved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://www.odin-project.eu/">ORCID and DataCite Interoperability Network</a> (ODIN), a EU-funded project that had its kickoff meeting last week in Berlin.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/odin-500x319.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="319"></figure><p>In the ODIN project we will work closely with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, an organization that provides digital object identifiers (DOIs) for research data. One of the many things I like about ODIN is that social sciences is one of the disciplines where we will build a proof of concept (with the British Library, the other discipline is high-energy physics and CERN). We also want to understand how to best link researchers, data and publications. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a> is an ODIN project partner and obviously has a lot of experience linking biological datasets to publications, and we will discuss how to integrate ORCID identifiers into the workflow.</p><p>Unique identifiers for researchers are of course also an essential part of any work on article-level metrics. I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/06/25/random-notes-from-the-altmetrics12-conference/">spoke about this</a> at the altmetrics12 conference in June, and I’m excited that we can now finally start linking things together. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> was one of the ORCID launch partners, and I demoed their ORCID integration last week in Berlin.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is a fork of the open source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics application</a>, and is a project I started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/">about a year ago</a>. ScienceCard allows researchers to list all their publications, and the metrics associated with them. With the launch of ORCID I was able to finally add one important missing piece. Through automatic lookup of the ORCID identifier and retrieval of the publications claimed in the ORCID profile is has become much easier to create and maintain a ScienceCard profile – it shouldn’t take more than 5 min and a few mouse clicks (collecting all metrics takes longer because that happens in the background). I added ORCID integration to ScienceCard over the weekend, using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://dev.orcid.org/resources">free public ORCID API</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/sciencecard-500x438.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="438"></figure><p>ScienceCard is a great tool to explore how research impact can be collected and displayed, and I appreciate feedback in the form of feature requests and bug reports, ideally in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/https://github.com/mfenner/alm/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> of the project. This will also provide very valuable feedback to improve the PLOS Article-Level Metrics application, as they use almost the same code base. The API is for example completely the same, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/https://github.com/ropensci/rplos">rplos</a> and other tools using the PLOS ALM API can be used with ScienceCard by just changing the URL. Another example is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/plos-alm-widget/">PLOS ALM WordPress Widget</a>, with minor modifications it can be also be used with ScienceCard, allowing a researcher to display the metrics for his publications from PLOS and other sources on his blog. The upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/">Altmetrics workshop and hackathon</a> (November 1-3 in San Francisco) will be a great opportunity to explore this further.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2012-09-19T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly a year ago (in the hackathon of the Science Online London 2011 conference) I <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/announcing-sciencecard/">started the ScienceCard project</a>. ScienceCard is a fork of the Open Source PLOS Article-Level Metrics (ALM) code, personalizing the Article-Level Metrics.</p><p>A lot has happened in the last 12 months, most importantly that I started to work for PLOS as technical lead for the Article-Level Metrics project in May. In July, version 2.0 of the PLOS ALM application was released, and the code made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">available on Github</a>. This not only means that everyone can install his own ALM application (assuming some familiarity with the Ruby and Rails web framework), but that we can fork the code and modify it.</p><p>Although my focus is now clearly on improving the PLOS application, it didn’t feel right to shut down the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> project. I really like the idea of personalized Article-Level Metrics (something I spoke about at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/06/25/random-notes-from-the-altmetrics12-conference/">altmetrics12</a> conference). So I sat down the last two weekends to upgrade ScienceCard to the PLOS ALM 2.0 code (the source code of my fork can be found <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/alm">here</a>). With the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://about.orcid.org/content/orcid-launch-plan-announced">imminent launch</a> of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) service next month I dropped the functionality to get all articles by a particular person from Microsoft Academic Search. For now you can add your articles by DOI or PubMed ID (currently only articles from PubMed), but you can now also add interesting articles not authored by you. This makes ScienceCard a nice tool to try out the PLOS ALM code without installing the software. Please remember that all metrics are collected in the background, so it can take a few hours until they show up for newly added articles.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sciencecard_new-500x312.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="sciencecard_new" width="500" height="312"></figure><p>ScienceCard also shows the power of open source software. Open source doesn’t simply mean free software, it means that you can modify the code if your requirements are different. For ScienceCard I added authentication via Twitter (required to add articles, I don’t want to deal with usernames and passwords), a simple lookup by DOI or PubMed ID (something not needed if you are publisher of the article and have that information), and comments and likes. Article-Level Metrics is not about collecting numbers, it is about capturing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2011/04/06/richard-smith-what-is-post-publication-peer-review/">activity surrounding an article post-publication</a>.</p>]]></content>

As always, the data behind the graphic are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action">openly available</a>. I think that the number of times a paper is informally discussed (comments, Facebook, science blogs, etc.) should be much larger compared to the numer of formal citations. The challenge is of course to have technology that captures all these discussions – this is much more difficult than for bookmarks or citations, and is obviously what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a> is all about. The blog posts I link to above also express another feeling: that there are still too many barriers for scientists to take part in the informal discussion of scholarly research on the web, in particular as comments on journal websites.

In the paper Natasha de Vere <em>et al.</em> describe a DNA barcode resource that covers the 1143 native Welsh flowering plants and conifers.</p><p>My new job as technical lead for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLoS Article Level Metrics (ALM) project</a> involves thinking about how we can best display the ALM collected for this and other papers. We want these ALM to tell us something important and/or interesting, and it doesn’t hurt if the information is displayed in a visually appealing way. There are many different ways this can be done, but here I want to focus on <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>CiteULike</strong>, the only two data sources where PLoS is currently storing every single event (tweet or CiteULike bookmark) with a date. Usage data (HTML and XML views, PDF downloads) are aggregated on a monthly basis, and PLoS doesn’t store the publication dates of citations.</p><p>We know from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">work of Gunter Eysenbach</a> and others that most tweets linking to scholarly papers are written in the first few days after publication. It therefore makes sense to display this information on a timeline covering the first 30 days after publication, and the tweets about the de Vere paper follow the same pattern.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sparklines.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="sparklines" width="500" height="375"></figure><p>I like the simplicity of sparklines. It would be interesting to also map the 274 Facebook <strong>Likes, Comments</strong> and <strong>Shares</strong>, but we don’t have date information for them.

You can read all 11 abstracts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/program/">here</a>, and the conference had good Twitter coverage (using the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/https://twitter.com/search/%23altmetrics12">#altmetrics12</a>), at least until Twitter had a total blackout around 12 PM our time.</p><p>All but two presenters used slides – I have uploaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/https://speakerdeck.com/u/mfenner/p/altmetrics-will-be-taken-personally-at-plos">my presentation</a> to Speaker Deck. Kelli Barr used the blackboard to explain that</p><ul><li>filtering (via altmetrics or any other means) by definition always selects out content and therefore runs against the democratization of science</li><li>peer review is a black box. altmetrics is also a black box, only much bigger</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/barr.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="barr" width="500" height="373"><figcaption>Kelli Barr used the blackboard for two important points in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/barr/">her talk</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>altmetrics12 was one of the best conferences that I have attended recently. The intensity of the discussions was palpable. My only regrets are that there wasn’t more time for discussions, but many of us convened in the bar afterwards.</p><p>We were off to a very strong start with two excellent keynote presentations by Johann Bollen ( Altmetrics: from usage data to social media) and Gregg Gordon (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrnblog.com/2012/05/18/alternative-is-the-new-grey/">Alternative is the new Grey</a>). Johann emphasized why it is both important and fascinating to study how science is actually working. He stressed that science is a gift economy, where the currency is acknowledgement of influence in the form of citations. He sees two major problems with the present citation-based analysis of scientific impact: a) data and b) the metrics. Citation data are very domain specific (with very different citation practices in different disciplines), and delayed (several years after publication of the research they are citing). The problem with current citation-based metrics is that they ignore the network effect in science. Johann then went on to explain the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://mesur.informatics.indiana.edu/">MESUR</a> project, which studies the patterns of scientific activity on a very large scale (1 billion usage events, 500 million citations, 50 million papers).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/journal.pone.0004803.g005.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Map of Science" width="320" height="305"><figcaption>Map of science from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004803">2009 PLoS ONE paper</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Johann then briefly explained the results of another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022">2009 PLoS ONE paper</a> where he analyzed 39 metrics with principal component analysis. He found two major components in the metrics analysis: counting vs. social influence and fast vs. slow.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/journal.pone.0006022.g002.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="PCA" width="320" height="227"><figcaption>Correlation of 37 metrics mapped onto first two principal components in another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022">2009 PLoS ONE paper</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Johann then told the interesting story behind a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3003">2010 paper</a> where he showed that <strong>Twitter mood can predict the stock market</strong>. The paper was rejected by all publishers and was finally published on ArXiV in October 2010. It immediately became very popular in terms of downloads and media attention (and was eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007">published</a> in the <em>Journal of Computational Science</em> in March 2011).</p><p>Gregg Gordon has summarized his keynote in a May <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrnblog.com/2012/05/18/alternative-is-the-new-grey/">blogpost</a>, so I will focus on a few highlights. Gregg Gordon runs the Social Science Research Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrn.com/">SSRN</a>), a leading resource for sharing social sciences research. Gregg thinks that altmetrics can provide the compass to navigate the map of science described earlier. He told us some very interesting anecdotes of users trying to game SSRN by inflating their download counts (e.g. “downloads for donuts”), and mentioned a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1346397">research paper</a>analyzing gaming at SSRN. Download counts are apparently taken very seriously by SSRN authors and are also used for hiring decisions. SSRN not only has written software to protect against gaming, but also has a person constantly looking over these numbers (Gregg feels that computer algorithms alone are not enough).</p><p>The two keynotes were followed by 11 short (10-15 minute) presentations, including two presentations about the PLoS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article-Level Metrics</a> project. Jennifer Lin spoke about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/lin/">anti-gaming mechanisms</a> and I emphasized the importance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/fenner/">personalizing altmetrics</a> to fully understand the “network of science”. All presentation abstracts are available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/program/">online</a>.</p><p>After the lunch break (and some interesting discussions) we continued with demos of various altmetrics applications and users, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://total-impact.org/">Total Impact</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.plumanalytics.com/">Plum Analytics</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a>, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://alm.plos.org/"> PLoS Article-Level Metrics</a> application, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://knodeinc.com/">Knode</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://academia.edu/">Academia.edu</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.biomedcentral.com/">BioMed Central</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.ubiquitypress.com/">Ubiquity Press</a> (example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/article/intensive-survey-data-from-antikythera-greece/">here</a>).</p><p>In the last our and a half we split up into several smaller group to discuss issues relevant for altmetrics. I was in the <strong>standards</strong> group and we all agreed that it is too early to sep up rigid standards for this evolving field, but not too early to start the discussion. The two standards experts in our group (Todd Carpenter from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</a> and David Baker from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://casrai.org/">CASRAI</a>) were of course very helpful with the discussion in our group. In the closing group discussion the breakout groups reported their major discussion points (which will hopefully be written up by someone). We also learned that the NIH is considering changing the Biosketch format for CVs and is looking for input via a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-12-115.html">Request for Information</a> (RFI) until June 29.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has become common practice to make presentation slides available for those unable to attend in person, or for more in-depth review later. The most popular service to do this is of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a>. Slideshare is a fine service, but the website has become fairly cluttered over the years, and visuals are of course important when it comes to presentations.<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://speakerdeck.com/">Speaker Deck</a> is an alternative to Slideshare with a focus on “simplicity and beauty”.

It would be helpful if Speaker Deck allowed the upload of Powerpoint or Keynote files, making it easier to reuse the slides. But the big item on my wish list is an improvement of the social activities enabled around a presentation. I want to see download counts, comments, number of tweets and Facebook likes, and I want an API for them. Ordered List, the company behind Speakerdeck, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/ordered-list-acquired-by-github/">acquired by Github</a> in December, turning Speaker Deck into a Github product.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog occasionally does interviews with people providing interesting tools for scholars. These <a href="https://front-matter.io/interviews">interviews</a> have always been among my favorite blog posts. This now is obviously an interview with myself, but I felt this is the best format to explain some important news.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/429781913_9524791cff_c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="532" height="800"><figcaption><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevec77/429781913/">Flickr photo</a> my stevec77.</figcaption></figure><p>Starting May 16 I will be working full-time as technical lead for the PLoS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article Level Metrics</a> (ALM) project. I will help with development of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">PLoS ALM application</a>, and will do community developer outreach for this project.</p><p>The PLoS ALM application is written in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, an open-source web framework I have been working with since 2005. The ALM project was launched in 2009, and I first learned about ALM in a July 2009 presentation by Pete Binfield at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">SciBarCamp Palo Alto</a>. A month later I did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">interview with Pete</a> about Article Level Metrics and PLoS ONE.</p><h3 id="what-is-article-level-metrics">What is Article Level Metrics?</h3><p>Article Level Metrics <em>place transparent and  comprehensive information about the usage and reach of published articles onto the articles themselves, so that the entire academic community can assess their value </em>(from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLoS ALM website</a>). A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000242">November 2009 paper</a> by Cameron Neylon and Shirley Wu gives a more detailed introduction. And a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://www.slideshare.net/kristenratan/metrics-the-new-black">recent presentation</a> by Kristen Ratan, PLoS Director of Product Management, given at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://www.nfais.org/page/361-program-2012-nfais-annual-conference">2012 NFAIS meeting</a>, provides an update for 2012.</p><p>Article Level Metrics is part of the larger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a> movement, which also looks at metrics for other scholarly works besides journal articles.</p><h3 id="does-this-mean-that-you-will-be-moving-to-san-francisco">Does this mean that you will be moving to San Francisco?</h3><p>For personal reasons I will continue to live in Hannover, Germany and work from home as a contractor with occasional trips to San Francisco.</p><h3 id="will-you-miss-treating-cancer-patients-and-doing-cancer-research">Will you miss treating cancer patients and doing cancer research?</h3><p>Absolutely. This has not been an easy decision. To make the transition easier, I will continue to spend 10% of my time at Hannover Medical School. I will no longer be seeing patients, but this will allow me to conclude the RADIT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242631">clinical trial</a> for testicular cancer patients where I am the principal investigator.</p><p>I hope to continue doing research in the new position, but with a focus on information science. There are for example still a lot of things we don’t know about altmetrics. A more detailed analysis of our recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/19/crowdsourcing-the-analysis-of-scholarly-tweets/">CrowdoMeter</a> project (a crowdsourced analysis of tweets linking to scholarly papers) would be a good start.</p><h3 id="what-will-happen-with-sciencecard">What will happen with ScienceCard?</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is a website that collects author level metrics and was my entry into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/">Mendeley/PLoS Binary Battle API contest</a> last fall.

I will decide in the coming months what to do with ScienceCard.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://altmetrics.org/">Altmetrics</a> – tools to assess the impact of scholarly works based on alternative online measures such as bookmarks, links, blog posts, etc. –have become a regular topic in this blog. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics manifesto</a> was published in October 2010, and in the last 18 months we have seen a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://altmetrics.org/tools/">number of interesting new altmetrics services</a>, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://blogs.plos.org/blog/tag/sciencecard/">ScienceCard</a> service that I started six months ago. ScienceCard has been a very interesting learning experience, because I not only had to write the software, but also think about my perspective on altmetrics. Some of my recent thoughts are listed below.</p><p><strong>FriendFeed still is a great model for a scholarly service</strong><br>I have stopped using FriendFeed a few months ago in favor of Twitter, but I still very much like the design of the service. I think that the concept should also work very well for altmetrics, and I have therefore continued work on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_stream">activity stream</a> for ScienceCard. At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://sciencecard.org/works">http://sciencecard.org/works</a> you find a listing of all recent scholarly works of your ScienceCard friends, and now you can like/comment/share them. ScienceCard friends are the people you follow on Twitter who also have a ScienceCard account and sharing is possible via Mendeley and CiteULike. Comments are still in the testing stage, and Twitter integration is also in the works. I also want to add more scholarly content including Slideshare presentations and blog posts, although the latter are really hard to do in an automated way.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/activitystream.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="activitystream" width="500" height="287"></figure><p>Altmetrics tools should not only present scholarly works and their metrics, but they should also allow users to interact with them via sharing, commenting, etc.</p><p><strong>Altmetrics is about search</strong><br>Altmetrics is really about two related concepts: reputation and discovery. ScienceCard tries to summarize the metrics available about a particular researcher, although much more work needs to be done to show that these numbers correlate with reputation. The discovery aspect of altmetrics is at least as important, and this means that these alternative metrics should help provide better search results. Some bibliographic databases let you sort your search results by number of citations – the problem is of course that citations can have a delay of several years. Download counts, social bookmarks, Twitter links, etc. on the other hand can give information about the impact of a paper within days of publication. The search results can be improved further by personalizing them based on what the friends in your social network are publishing, bookmarking or discussing.</p><p><strong>Altmetrics is expensive</strong><br>It is great to see so many altmetrics grassroots projects. Unfortunately it is resource-intensive and therefore costly to collect altmetrics, in particular if it is almost real-time numbers such as Twitter citations. I’m afraid that many people (including myself) will have a hard time providing this service in a sustainable way. There are two possible solutions: providing altmetrics as a commercial service, and providing altmetrics as a collaborative effort. Although I understand the reasoning behind commercial services, I would very much prefer the open and collaborative approach. Collaboration could mean that several people and/or organizations join forces and run an altmetrics service together, but it could also mean that we break altmetrics into smaller services connected via programming interfaces. A typical altmetrics service has at least these functions:</p><ul><li>an interface to add journal articles and other scholarly objects, whether it is manual input by users or via an API</li><li>a searchable database with metadata about scholarly objects</li><li>a background service that collects metrics from other sources</li><li>a public interface that displays metrics for particular scholarly objects and collections</li><li>an interface for visualization and analysis of aggregate numbers</li></ul><p>I don’t think that all five functions (and possibly more) necessarily have to be provided by the same service. I’m sure that there are enough people that are only interested in providing interesting ways to add scholarly objects, or in visualization and analysis. The background service is probably the most boring and resource-intensive part.</p><p><strong>I want second-order metrics</strong><br>Second-order metrics means the metrics for the scholarly works citing a particular paper or for the person bookmarking or tweeting a scholarly work. This approach would add valuable information and is obviously similar to the PageRank algorithm for web links. Unfortunately this approach also creates a lot of extra work, as this means collecting the metrics (or at least some metrics) for all citing works. Again something that makes altmetrics expensive.</p><p><strong>Twitter is important</strong><br>Many of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/02/09/more-tweets-more-citations/">recent altmetrics discussions</a> have really been about the role of Twitter in scholarly communication. A lot of people are excited about the potential of Twitter to help discover interesting scholarly works, and to allow this within days after publication. It is still too early to know for sure whether <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">highly tweeted papers will be cited more often later on</a>. Better Twitter integration is high on my to do list for ScienceCard.</p><p><strong>Yet another bibliographic database</strong><br>The core function of altmetrics is to build a database with metadata about scholarly objects, including a variety of metrics. There are of course a large number of bibliographic databases already out there, so maybe existing databases can also be extended to include metrics. Ideally the existing database should not be restricted to particular kinds of scholarly works (e.g. journal articles) or disciplines, should be free to use and should allow reuse of the data with an appropriate license. There are several candidates that fit this description, includind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://bibsoup.net/">BibSoup</a> run by the Open Knowledge Foundation and possibly also the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero </a>database allowing synchronization with the desktop reference manager. Both services focus on biobliographic collections uploaded by users, whereas my idea of an altmetrics database relies on disambiguated authors and scholarly works.</p><p><strong>There are too many altmetrics</strong><br>It is great that altmetrics increases the variety of available metrics, but too many different metrics can be confusing to users. Although it is interesting that the number of citations for the same work vary widely between PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Microsoft Academic Search, Pubmed and Google Scholar, the typical user is probably only interested in one citation count. The same is true for usage metrics and number of social bookmarks. I think it would be helpful to consolidate the metrics about a scholarly work to maybe five numbers, including views/downloads, bookmarks, citations, comments, and tweets. This doesn’t mean that the other information shouldn’t be collected, just that the numbers will be consolidated for display.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was another week with a fair amount of spam in my email inbox. We all receive email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE">spam</a> on a regular basis and most of us have probably also received science spam: invitations to scientific conferences about topics we are not working on, invitations to submit articles to journals not covering your field, and information about lab supplies we never had asked for. Although I’m of course aware that spam is now a fact of online life, I don’t quiet understand how this science spam works.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722im_/http://farm1.staticflickr.com/206/519906069_de5953764a_m.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SPAM" loading="lazy"><figcaption><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajc1/519906069/in/photostream/">Flickr photo</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/">AJ Cann</a>.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>1. How do science spammers get my email address?</strong><br>Most science spam is not really targeted towards my research interests. From this I conclude that these spammers automatically harvest email addresses of researchers, or they buy these lists. One potential source to harvest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/07/13/did-you-receive-spam-because-you-published-a-paper/">email addresses is PubMed</a> and other bibliographic databases, but I don’t know whether this is actually done.</p><p><strong>2. Is even a small percentage of researchers responding to this science spam?</strong><br>Science spam is as uninteresting to me as any other spam, and I can’t really imagine a colleague submitting a manuscript to a journal marketed this way. But the idea behind spam is that there is a – admittedly very small – conversion rate.</p><p><strong>3. When will we start to see more social media science spam?</strong><br>I think it is only a question of time before we see more science spam on Twitter, Google+ and Facebook – I already receive a small amount of spam through these channels.</p><p><strong>4. Is there anything an individual researcher can other than using good spam filters in his email program?</strong><br>Would it for example help if we hide our email address as much as possible? Should we deny publishers the permission to post our email address in journal articles, and should places like PubMed hide them? Do publisher organizations such as OASPA (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association) enforce their <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://www.oaspa.org/conduct.php">Member Code of Conduct</a>,</strong> which clearly state that a<em>ny direct marketing activities publishers engage in shall be appropriate and unobtrusive.</em></p><p><strong>5. Will it get worse?</strong><br>I know this answer. Yes. This blog has seen more than 60,000 spam comments already, most of the spam in my email is filtered out before I even see it, but I think it will get much worse – via email and other channels.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In December Euan Adie and I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">started the CrowdoMeter projec</a>t, an analysis of the semantic content of tweets linking to scholarly papers. Because classifying almost 500 tweets is a lot of work, we turned this into a crowdsourcing project. We got help from 36 people, who did 953 classifications, and we discussed the preliminary results (available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">here</a>) at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference.</p><p>There is no reason to stop the crowdsourcing here, so we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://hdl.handle.net/10779/01c28ce592291e7e294ed328208a5869">uploaded the result set</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/16/figshare-interview-with-mark-hahnel/">figshare</a> and invite everybody to help us with the data analysis. For this purpose I have created a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer">public repository</a> on Github which contains not only the source code for the CrowdoMeter website, but also all data – the same dataset made available on figshare. I have written a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer/blob/crowdometer/public/assets/shares_author.R">first R script</a> that produces the following pie chart:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/authors.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="authors" width="360" height="376"></figure><p>The figure doesn’t look all that exciting, but there is some calculation involved. There are different numbers of classifications per tweet and sometimes there is disagreement: true means at least 50% of classifications were true. It would be great if we find people willing to help with data analysis, preferably using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://rstudio.org/">R</a> and contributing their scripts to the Github repository.

The service was started by Mark Hahnel last year while still a PhD student. Mark joined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a> to work on fig<strong>share</strong> in September and last month relaunched a much improved version of the service. I asked Mark a few questions about fig<strong>share</strong> below. I also uploaded two datasetst to fig<strong>share</strong> and made them publicly available:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://hdl.handle.net/10779/1c48a305c08c717fea3f6fe1687b3eff">CrowdoMeter Tweets</a> – all 467 tweets used in the CrowdoMeter project</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://hdl.handle.net/10779/01c28ce592291e7e294ed328208a5869">CrowdoMeter Classifications</a> – all 953 classifications from the CrowdoMeter project.</li></ul><h2 id="1-what-is-figshare">1. What is figshare?</h2><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://figshare.com/">figshare</a> is a repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable, sharable and discoverable manner. figshare allows users to upload any file format so that figures, datasets and media can be disseminated in a way that the current scholarly publishing model does not allow.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/screenshot.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="screenshot" width="500" height="258"></figure><h2 id="2-what-is-the-right-content-for-figshare-and-what-should-rather-go-somewhere-else">2. What is the right content for figshare? And what should rather go somewhere else?</h2><p>Every experiment that is completed without error in the methods is valuable. Researchers investigate things because the question is interesting and supposedly unanswered. This means that other researchers will at some point ask that same question. Just because the hypothesis didn’t turn out to be true, doesn’t mean that this data should be thrown away.</p><p>With fig<strong>share</strong>, you can share your negative results or results that you were not planning to publish. You can make raw data available or supplementary material that journals cannot handle linked to from the published article. You can even make your papers and posters available and citable. People have uploaded whole chapters of their PhD thesis to share with the world and make sure that all of their hard work is not wasted.</p><p>Currently we are not focusing on handling massive datasets, whilst this is an aim for the future. These edge cases seem to be better handled by journals set up specifically for publishing these huge files, such as the excellent <a>GigaScience</a>.</p><h2 id="3-you-relaunched-figshare-in-january-what-has-changed-to-the-previous-version">3. You relaunched figshare in January. What has changed to the previous version?</h2><p>The old site was a proof of concept based on Mediawiki software. The new site has been completely built from scratch so that it is rapidly extendable in terms of features and scale. This means that we can adapt quickly and easily to the needs of researchers. As well as being much more intuitive, the biggest new feature for fig<strong>share</strong> is the private space.</p><p>Whilst we would like everyone to make all of their research objects available, we appreciate that some researchers would like to keep research private for many reasons. Because of this we set about giving users their own private repository to store their research objects. These objects can be uploaded in seconds and all objects are initially held in the private space, from where they can be made publicly available when the user decides. All research is easily tagged and categorisable, so that researchers can filter through their many files to find the one they were looking for in no time at all.</p><h2 id="4-how-important-is-the-user-interface-for-figshare-what-particular-features-do-you-like-the-most">4. How important is the user interface for figshare? What particular features do you like the most?</h2><p>The user interface is essential, researchers are busy enough as it it. They haven’t got the time to attend training course on how to use a repository. If this was the case with facebook, no one would use facebook. For this reason fig<strong>share</strong> is stupidly simple and allows users to get their research onto the site in seconds, even the PIs. At this point they can choose to make it publicly available and immediately citable, sharable and discoverable, or keep it private – securely hosted, taggable and accessible when they need it, from anywhere in the world.</p><p>This is something we are constantly aiming to improve and we not only welcome feedback, we are actively seeking the thoughts of researchers on how we can make this a seemless part of their research process.</p><h2 id="5-do-you-have-plans-for-a-desktop-version-of-figshare-e-g-to-watch-folders-for-new-figshare-content">5. Do you have plans for a desktop version of figshare, e.g. to watch folders for new figshare content?</h2><p>We do! By creating a desktop uploader, the process becomes even more intuitive for researchers, allowing them to make backups of their research in the cloud with no effort expenditure. Research data management is something I personally was terrible at. My research was organised into folders based on the month and the year I did that work. I lost days trying to find files that ‘I know I worked on sometime last summer’. Hopefully a desktop uploader will add to the current simple management system so that researchers like me have no excuse when it comes to losing (often expensive) results files.</p><h2 id="6-how-is-figshare-different-from-data-repositories">6. How is figshare different from data repositories?</h2><p>fig<strong>share</strong> is not limited as many repositories are. It caters for all research domains, no matter where your research is carried out. Institutional repositories are often limited to members of said institution. Also, the majority of institutional repositories are built specifically for papers. The Dryad repository has been doing some great work making the datasets behind published articles available under CC0. fig<strong>share</strong> is not limited by the normal constraints of publishing, data generated in the lab can be shared and made available to the world as a citable object the same day.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/usermetrics.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="usermetrics" width="275" height="115"></figure><p>fig<strong>share</strong> also gives the researchers the credit for their research. By adding metrics to the public uploads, and putting the cumulative metrics of a researcher’s uploads on their profile, users can see the true impact and reach of the hard work they put in.</p><h2 id="7-you-currently-use-handles-for-figshare-content-what-are-your-thoughts-on-persistent-identifiers-are-the-plans-to-use-dois">7. You currently use handles for figshare content. What are your thoughts on persistent identifiers? Are the plans to use DOIs?</h2><p>Persistent identifiers are essential for the long term availability of research outputs. One of the reasons I set up figshare was because I wanted to cite a video in my thesis. Research data on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://figshare.com/blog/A%20YouTube%20%20for%20Scientists/11">YouTube</a> is not easily citable, by adding persitent identifiers and an organised citation structure, videos as well as any other file format can be easily cited. All citations can be exported to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.refman.com/">RefMan</a>with one click. We use handles at the moment, but have noticed that researchers tend to be more familiar with DOI’s and so will be making the move over to them shortly. We’re currently working with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> through the British Library to get this set up.</p><h2 id="8-how-does-figshare-guarantee-long-term-preservation-of-uploaded-data">8. How does figshare guarantee long-term preservation of uploaded data?</h2><p>The long term persistence of this research data is essential. The research is backed up locally as soon as it is uploaded. We are currently in talks with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.portico.org/">Portico</a> to back up all data and further guarantee this long term persistence.</p><h2 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-figshare-what-did-you-do-before-figshare">9. What are your responsibilities at figshare? What did you do before Figshare?</h2><p>I’m basically responsible for making the platform as useful for researchers as possible. I also love going to talk at Universities and conferences to researchers directly, to hear their thoughts/opinions. As a former life science researcher (I finished my PhD in stem cell biology at Imperial College London in September), I understand that what makes sense in a rational world does not make sense in the scientific world. You just have to look at the established model of scientific research dissemination to understand that. fig<strong>share</strong> is useful whether you want to make all of your research outputs available or none. Science would just be a lot more efficient and dynamic if they did.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference last week again was a wonderful experience. This was my third time in North Carolina, and I had many great conversations in the sessions, hallways – and bars. One of many highlights was a lunch meeting with fellow PLoS bloggers and staffers:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/6732330879_726113a81d.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="PLoS Crew at Science Online2" loading="lazy" width="500" height="333"><figcaption>Flickr photo by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://www.flickr.com/photos/brian_and_dawn/">briandcrawford</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Together with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://twitter.com/Stew">Euan Adie</a> I moderated a session on Friday:</p><h2 id="using-altmetrics-tools-to-track-the-scholarly-impact-of-your-research-">Using altmetrics tools to track the scholarly impact of your research.</h2><p>We started the session by asking several people in the audience to demonstrate their altmetrics tools: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a> (Euan Adie), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://readermeter.org/">ReaderMeter</a> (Dario Taraborelli), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://total-impact.org/">Total Impact</a> (Jason Priem), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLoS Article-Level Metrics</a> (Jennifer Lin), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> (me). We briefly showed our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://crowdometer.org/">CrowdoMeter</a> project where we crowdsourced the meaning of tweets about scholarly papers.</p><p>The discussion covered many interesting aspects. I would like to focus on three of them.</p><h3 id="gaming">Gaming</h3><p>Altmetrics are still fairly new, and therefore not many people try to the cheat yet (but almost 1% of tweets in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">CrowdoMeter dataset</a> were already spam). I’m sure that this will change over time, and some metrics will be more prone to gaming than others. Gaming is a particular problem for usage stats, as it is difficult to impossible to verify them. Metrics provided by the producer of a research object (author or publisher) will be more susceptible to gaming than metrics from an independent source. Anonymous metrics (e.g. Mendeley readers) are more susceptible to gaming than metrics that list the source of every citation (e.g. CiteULike bookmarks).</p><h3 id="context">Context</h3><p>Altmetrics is currently at a stage where we collect various metrics, but don’t really know what these numbers mean. Does 1,000 downloads, 10 Mendeley bookmarks or 50 tweets mean that the paper has impact? And how do we compare altmetrics from different disciplines? Does it make a difference if a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/fields/details/">Fields Medalist</a> blogs about your paper (an example given in the session)? I think that the most interesting metrics are those that take into account who is citing the work, being it a regular citation, a social bookmark or a social media comment. This is of course how Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> works for webpages, and how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://www.eigenfactor.org/">Eigenfactor</a> ranks scholarly journals. The context can be further improved by including the social networks of the person looking for information, e.g. how many people I follow on Twitter have bookmarked this particular paper.</p><h3 id="scope">Scope</h3><p>The tools discussed in the ScienceOnline session all have a particular approach for gathering altmetrics: altmetrics over a given time period (<em>altmetric.com</em>), altmetrics for content produced by a particular publisher (<em>PLoS ALM</em>), altmetrics for a given researcher (<em>ReaderMeter</em> and <em>ScienceCard</em>), and altmetrics produced for a given dataset on demand (<em>Total-Impact</em>). One obvious advantage of this approach is that it reduces the number of datasets needed to run the service. Unfortunately this is an arbitrary distinction, and it falls apart when you use a PageRank approach and also look at the metrics of citing sources.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>I think that altmetrics has made tremendous progress in 2011, but that there is a lot of work to do in 2012. I’m very interested in altmetrics based on PageRank, but also want to take social networks into consideration. This is of course how finding information on the web works – scholarly communication is just a subset. Unfortunately this approach requires a massive database of scholarly citations, something that is impossible to do for the small part-time altmetrics projects mentioned at the beginning of the post.</p><p>I’m less interested in usage metrics because they are so prone to gaming and will probably become problematic in a few years, and I want to focus on a reasonable number of altmetrics. I hope that there will never be a single “altmetric”, but I also don’t think that we need 20 different altmetrics for every scholarly work. A lot of interesting work ahead for my ScienceCard project.</p><p>I’m looking forward to the altmetrics session at ScienceOnline2013.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago Euan Adie from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a> and myself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">launched</a> the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://crowdometer.org/">CrowdoMeter</a>, a crowdsourcing project that tries to classify tweets about scholarly articles using the Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO). Despite the holidays we have gotten off to a good start with currently 597 classifications by 56 different users, already covering 93% of the tweets we wanted to classify. We will discuss the results of this project at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference in two weeks, but the most important findings can also be watched in real-time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">here</a>.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first time that CiTO has been used for the systematic classification of tweets, and the preliminary results seem to confirm what we and others had thought, i.e. that most tweets contain little semantic information and often only retweet the title of a paper. But not only do we now have numbers to confirm this, but we can also make some interesting additional observations. We find for example that only 1% of tweets disagree with the statements made in a paper – most Twitter users don’t seem to care telling others about papers they dislike or disagree with.</p><p>This project is far from over, ideally we want 3-5 classifications per tweet or an additional 1,000 classifications. It is a challenge to build a website so that enough people want to help with this project. One idea is to make the classifications as simple as possible, and to help further with this we today launched a mobile version of CrowdoMeter. Simply browse to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://crowdometer.org/">http://crowdometer.org</a> with your iPhone or Android phone, sign in via your Twitter account, and you should see something similar to this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2012/01/crowdometer.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="crowdometer"></figure><p>CrowdoMeter uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>, a touch-optimized Javascript framework for smartphones and tablets. There are still some minor issues, but in general jQuery Mobile is a great tool to optimize a website for mobile users. Users are presented with 10 random tweets they haven’t classified yet, and see a simple classification screen when clicking (touching) a tweet:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/crowdometer1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="crowdometer1" width="320" height="480"></figure><p>It should not take longer than 15 minutes to classify 15-25 tweets, and this would be a tremendous help for the project.</p><p>The CrowdoMeter results page displayed the same information as in the desktop version of the website, the charts are produced by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> Javascript library (and again jQuery).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/crowdometer2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="crowdometer2" width="320" height="480"></figure><p>I’m interested to see how well the crowdsourcing for CrowdoMeter will work in the coming weeks. We hope to finish the data gathering part in January. If this project generates enough interest I could imagine doing another crowdsourcing project, maybe again using the Citation Typing Ontology, but this time for blog posts about scholarly papers.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2011-12-08T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Version 1.0 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://annotum.org/">Annotum</a>, the free WordPress theme for writing scholarly articles, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/more-spring-cleaning-out-of-season.html">announced</a> in late November. Back in June I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/06/30/annotum-publishing-with-wordpress-soon-coming-to-a-journal-near-you/">wrote about</a> the first public version of Annotum, but until now using Annotum was experimental. Annotum is available in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/annotum-base">WordPress Themes Directory</a> at WordPress.org (and has been downloaded more than 9,000 times in the past three weeks), and is also available for users of WordPress.com. I have installed Annotum 1.0 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://blogs.scienceonlinelondon.org/annotum/">here</a>, please drop me a note if you want an account.</p><p>But how is an Annotum blog different from a regular WordPress blog?</p><h3 id="annotum-is-a-wordpress-theme">Annotum is a WordPress Theme</h3><p>WordPress can be extended via Plugins and Themes. Whereas Plugins add functionality, themes usually change the look and feel of a WordPress site. Annotum is a theme that includes a lot of plugin functionality. This strategy makes it easier to get started with Annotum, as there is only one theme to install and not a set of plugins that has to work with a particular theme. Annotum can still be extended via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">child themes</a>, e.g. if you want a different look for your blog. And of course you can still use other scholarly plugins.</p><h3 id="annotum-uses-articles-and-not-posts">Annotum uses articles and not posts</h3><p>Annotum uses the custom post type <em><em>article</em></em> for scholarly content. This can be confusing in the beginning, but makes it easier to separate scholarly content from regular blog posts.</p><h3 id="the-annotum-editor-knows-about-document-structure"><strong><strong>The Annotum editor knows about document structure</strong></strong></h3><p>Scholarly articles have more structure than blog posts, and you can add this structure with the Annotum editor (see below). This structure is enforced, and the WordPress HTML editor is disabled. This makes it easier to create content that conforms to the NLM-DTD XML format.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/annotum1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="annotum1" width="487" height="319"></figure><h3 id="annotum-can-import-and-export-in-the-nlm-dtd-format">Annotum can import and export in the NLM-DTD format</h3><p>More specifically, Annotum supports the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/kipling/">Kipling subset</a> of the NLM Journal Publishing DTD. NLM-DTD is the standard XML format for scholarly articles, and you can for example import published articles (with a license that allows reuse) into Annotum to get started.

It has everything you need to write great scholarly content with WordPress and improves a regular WordPress blog in several important ways. Thanks to the support for the NLM-DTD format, Annotum can also be used as a writing tool for articles intended for submission somewhere else. One of the biggest strengths of WordPress is that it is really a writing <em><em>platform</em></em> that can be extended in many interesting ways. Maybe we will see WordPress plugins that enhance the equation editor or the reference management – or that connect Annotum to traditional journal submission systems.</p><p>Science bloggers will also be interested in many of the features of Annotum, but they don’t need the review workflow and might find that the support for NLM-DTD restricts them in how they can write content. Annotum is at version 1.0, and it is therefore not surprising that it still has a few rough edges. My biggest wish for a future version is better support for revisions and inline comments – Google Docs and other collaborative writing tools do a much better job highlighting the changes made in a text.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2011-11-20T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m very proud to report that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> last week has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://dev.mendeley.com/api-binary-battle">named finalist</a> in the Mendeley/PLoS API Binary Battle. Not bad for a project that started only two months ago in a hackathon following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a> conference and is done in my spare time. The winners of the contest will be named on November 30, but I’m more than happy that the project has even gotten this far.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/11/sciencecard.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="sciencecard"></figure><p>The idea of ScienceCard is threefold:</p><ul><li>make it as easy as possible to create a profile page with your publications</li><li>Automatically collect citations and other metrics for these publications</li><li>make it as easy as possible to reuse this information, e.g. in your personal blog or reference manager</li></ul><p>Registration with ScienceCard is easy. You create an account by logging in via Twitter (using the OAuth 2 protocol for the technically inclined), and then add your account name from one or more author identifier services. I added Google Scholar today, the other options are Microsoft Academic Search, AuthorClaim and Mendeley (I’m working on Scopus Author ID). If you add an Microsoft Academic Search or AuthorClaim identifier, ScienceCard will import all your publications from these services. ScienceCard currently only understands publications with a DOI, other scholarly items could be added in the future. With Mendeley and Google Scholar you only link to these services, I’m still having trouble with the Mendeley OAuth 1 authentication and Google Scholar doesn’t have an API.</p><p>ScienceCard is importing all the relevant bibliographic information using the CrossRef service. And ScienceCard is creating a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/10/17/serving-shortdois/">shortDOI</a> for all papers. But more interestingly, ScienceCard is calculating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">article-level metrics</a> for all publications, and composite numbers for authors. For this ScienceCard is using the PLoS Article-Level Metrics API code, but I have added more sources, including Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search and altmetric.com (but here only the number of blog posts citing a paper). ScienceCard links to most sources so that you can see the actual citations there, only CrossRef and altmetric.com don’t offer that. A future update will show all citations directly in ScienceCard.</p><p>ScienceCard tries to display a nice profile page for each researcher, but also makes it easy to reuse the information somewhere else. Each author page is available in six different formats, simply add the extension after the (Twitter) username, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://sciencecard.org/mfenner.json">http://sciencecard.org/mfenner.json</a></p><ul><li>HTML – for regular viewing</li><li>XML – for reuse by another computer</li><li>JSON – for reuse by another computer</li><li>CSV – comma-separated values for import into a spreadsheet</li><li>RIS – for reuse by a reference manager</li><li>BIB – BibTeX, for reuse by a reference manager</li></ul><p>JSON is the most interesting format, because it makes it very easy to connect two different services. If you for example want to use ScienceCard data on your personal WordPress blog you can simply download my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-info-options/">Contact Info Options WordPress</a> plugin, add your ScienceCard username in your WordPress settings and do some hacking of the author template. The process is unfortunately different for every WordPress theme, but you can see an example WordPress profile that uses the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://annotum.wordpress.com/">Annotum</a> theme (and publishing platform) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://blogs.scienceonlinelondon.org/annotum/author/mfenner/">here</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/11/annotum2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="annotum2"></figure><p>This WordPress author profile is generated on the fly using ScienceCard data, and will therefore automatically update.</p><p>The ScienceCard project is still at the beginning, and there are enough ideas to move this project forward in interesting ways. I’m particularly interested in improving the user interface and display of information, in adding datasets and other scholarly content, and in integrating with the ORCID unique author identifier service once the service launches in spring 2012. If you are interested to learn more about ScienceCard, please contact me via email or Twitter, or attend the altmetrics session at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a>, which I will do together with Euan Adie from altmetric.com and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://altmetric.com/interface/plos.html">PLoS Impact Explorer</a>, and Jason Priem from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://total-impact.org/">Total Impact</a> (two other Mendeley/PLoS API Binary Battle finalists).</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/why-bibtex-ris-and-endnote-xml-will-soon-be-broken"/>
        <updated>2011-11-08T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> is one of the most popular file formats for bibliographies, and is therefore commonly used to transfer bibliographies from one reference manager to another, or to other applications that handle bibliographic references. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp">RIS</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.endnote.com/support/helpdocs/endnote.zip">Endnote XML</a> are probably the other two bibliographic file formats most commonly used. Most reference managers support all three formats, making it easy to move references around.</p><p>All three formats have been around for a while, BibTeX for example since 1985. Reference management has of course gone through many changes during this time, and an important change will happen next year: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/orcid/">unique identifiers for scholarly authors</a>. In 2012 the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) initiative will start issuing unique identifiers for researchers, and researchers, universities, funding organizations, publishers and hopefully everyone else will start using them. But ORCID will only be successful if as many bibliographic tools as possible can handle ORCID identifiers, and if these tools can exchange these author identifiers.</p><p>None of the three bibliographic file formats mentioned above can handle unique author identifiers. If we take for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://sciencecard.org/articles/d6n">this paper</a> from ScienceCard, then the authors would look like this in BibTeX:</p><pre><code>author = {Kirstein, Janine and Dougan, David and Gerth, Ulf and Hecker, Michael and Turgay, Kürşad}</code></pre><p>And like this in RIS:</p><pre><code>AU  - Kirstein, Janine 
AU  - Dougan, David 
AU  - Gerth, Ulf 
AU  - Hecker, Michael 
AU  - Turgay, Kürşad</code></pre><p>I suggest we extend the BibTeX  format to understand author identifiers like this:</p><pre><code>orcid = {1274643, 8474644, 847412, 9183414, 7461414}</code></pre><p>And RIS:</p><pre><code>AI  - 1274643 
AI  - 8474644 
AI  - 847412 
AI  - 9183414 
AI  - 7461414</code></pre><p>This would look similar in Endnote XML. Will we see these changes to BibTeX, RIS and Endnote XML in 2012? I don’t know, but I very much hope so. Imagine what your Zotero, Mendeley or Endnote could do if the application knew about unique author identifiers, e.g. find all papers by a particular author, alert me when a particular author publishes something new, or organize your reference library by author.</p>]]></content>

I was assigned to the <strong><strong>#recognition</strong></strong> group, and we started with a very open discussion about recognition, reputation, altmetrics and related topics. The work was much more focussed on the second day, where we produced a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://msrworkshop.tumblr.com/tagged/recognition">draft text</a> with practical recommendations.</p><p>We all reported back to the whole group in the plenary discussion the second day, but unfortunately didn’t have much time (and energy) left to discuss the reports of the other topic groups in more detail. It was suggested that we create a Wikipedia page summarizing our reports, so that researchers interested in new scholarly communication tools would have a starting point.</p><p>I personally felt that most reports (including our own) had too much detail information – they are great resources of information, but are probably overwhelming for the average researcher. I therefore thought that a good alternative to a wiki page would be a Question &amp; Answer site similar to the hugely popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>. Even simpler would be a book in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/cookbooks.do">Cookbook</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://pragprog.com/book/fr_arr/advanced-rails-recipes">Recipes</a> format so popular with programmers. The book would be a collection of solutions for many of the small problems we face in scholarly communication today. We probably need hundreds of recipes, to start this off I today wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scholarly-communication-cookbook-create-a-researcher-profile-page/">recipe for creating a researcher profile page</a> (very much based on our topic report).</p>]]></content>

Today I flew to Boston for the Microsoft Research eScience Workshop: Transforming Scholarly Communication, and reading the book on the plane was the perfect preparation for the workshop.</p><p>Michael says in the book:</p><blockquote><em><em>I wrote this book with the goal of lightning an almighty fire under the scientific community. … We have an opportunity to change the way knowledge is constructed.</em></em></blockquote><p>You can <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9517.pdf">download the chapter 1 as PDF</a>, and you can also watch the videos of two of his recent presentations: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnWocYKqvhw">TEDx Waterloo</a> in March and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040623/http://river-valley.tv/keynote-solo2011/">Science Online London</a> in September.</p><p>The book uses examples from science and related disciplines – e.g. programming or chess – to examine both the opportunities and challenges of doing Open Science. The book is good reading, because Michael is aware of the many challenges that we face before science can be done differently. One example for this is the peer-reviewed journal article as the main currency to evaluate researchers. Until scientists are also rewarded for producing or curating data, programming scientific software, etc., we will not be able to start a new era of networked science.</p><p>Highly recommended reading.</p><p>Timo Hannay has also written a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nphys2109">review of the book</a> for Nature Physics, and I’m sure we will soon see many more.</p>]]></content>

For a good introduction I recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2010/05/long-handle-on-shortened-digital-object.html">Eric Hellman’s blog post</a> written in May 2010 when the shortDOI service was launched.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/2093290327_0803f40005.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="The long and the short of it" loading="lazy" width="320" height="480"></figure><p>shortDOIs provide exactly the same service as normal DOIs, i.e. they redirect the user to the digital resource. They are convenient, particularly for email and Twitter where space is limited. Links to journal articles created by URL shorteners such as bit.ly or goo.gl look similar, but require two redirects (first to dx.doi.org, then to the journal article). But URL shorteners provide additional services to users, e.g. customized links and usage statistics.</p><p>As far as I can tell shortDOIs have not become popular since the service started more than a year ago. One important reason is certainly that publishers are not really using them for their journal articles. I don’t think many users will go through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://shortdoi.org/">extra steps creating a shortDOI</a> just to use a DOI with Twitter – the Twitter URL shortener t.co will do this automatically for them. Michael Kuhn has created a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://blog.mckuhn.de/2011/02/bookmarklet-for-shortdoiorg.html">bookmarklet</a> that makes it a little bit easier to create shortDOIs. If we want shortDOIs to ever become popular, then we should ask journal publishers, bibliographic databases, reference managers and other places that currently use DOIs to enable them.</p><p>Starting yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is using shortDOIs instead of DOIs, and is also using the shortDOI to link to individual articles on ScienceCard, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://sciencecard.org/articles/dvq">http://sciencecard.org/articles/dvq</a>. Yesterday I’ve created about 750 shortDOIs for ScienceCard, and  this probably already makes ScienceCard one of the larger shortDOI users. I will decide in the coming months whether shortDOIs have improved the ScienceCard service. A nice feature would for example be the announcement of newly published papers via Twitter.</p>]]></content>

And Labtiva released a “community preview” of their reference manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.readcube.com/">ReadCube</a>. The community preview is a free download for Windows and Mac, and this is the summary of my first impressions.</p><p>You could write two different reviews about ReadCube. The first version would mention the really slick interface, and the fun you have using the program. ReadCube is doing a good job importing the PDFs on your hard drive and adding bibliographic information to them. In addition to PDF import you can also search PubMed and Google Scholar. ReadCube helps you find related papers by listing the references and citing papers of the paper you imported. ReaderCube also gives recommendations based on the papers in your library.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/10/readcube1-500x276.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="readcube"></figure><p>ReadCube includes an integrated PDF viewer that also allows text highlighting and note taking.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/readcube-500x275.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="readcube" width="500" height="275"></figure><p>The community preview is free, so please download ReadCube to find out whether you like it.</p><p>The second review would take a different approach. It would ask what problem ReadCube tries to solve, and why researchers should start using ReadCube rather than the tools they already use, maybe for many years. ReadCube is a reference manager with a particular focus on organizing the PDFs of scholarly papers. There a number of programs out there that can do the same. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> for Macintosh for example is a very similar program, but the first version of it has been released four years ago. Even more traditional reference managers now include inline PDF readers with annotation support, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.endnote.com/enx5info.asp">latest version of Endnote</a>. Mendeley and Zotero are two other alternatives, and they are both free and available for Windows, Mac and Linux. It’s difficult to see what is unique in ReadCube, and on the other hand some important features are missing (e.g. no bookmarklet to import from other sources, no reference type other than journal articles, no group sharing feature, no integration with Microsoft Word). And ReadCube is based on Adobe Air, a cross-platform development environment that you either love or hate.</p><p>It will be interesting to watch what direction ReadCube development will take. They started a few years later than their competitors, and it will be a lot of work to catch up. I wish the Labtiva team good luck.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2011-10-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is a new service that I started last month with the simple idea to automatically track all journal articles of a given author, and to collect the article-level metrics (citations, bookmarks, etc.) for these papers. ScienceCard requires unique identifiers for articles and authors to work. Unique identifiers for authors is a difficult topic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/orcid/">regularly discussed</a> in this blog. But I thought that using digital object identifiers (DOI) for journal articles would be easy. The system managed by CrossRef was started 10 years ago, and almost all journal publishers now use DOIs – there were 49,350,542 registered CrossRef DOI links as of today.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/4632436148_7795a0127c.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="number buttons" loading="lazy" width="500" height="375"><figcaption><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.flickr.com/photos/fragmented/4632436148/">Number buttons</a> by fragmented on Flickr</figcaption></figure><p>The first problem I encountered is that many bibliographic databases don’t fully support DOIs. Most of them store DOIs, but not all of them allow queries using DOIs, and very few services allow linking to them using DOIs. In the end I had to store various other article identifiers in ScienceCard (currently PubMed ID, PubMed Central ID, Microsoft Academic Search ID, Mendeley UUID, Scopus ID). One side effect of this proliferation of identifiers is that (in very rare cases) DOIs are not unique in these bibliographic services. And it makes it more complicated than necessary to build tools based on DOIs. The members of CrossRef are publishers, the other service providers (whether public or private) seem to be reluctant to fully support a service where they have no direct influence.</p><p>The second problem with DOIs is that they are often not web-friendly. DOIs are really permanent URLs, and CrossRef has recently changed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.crossref.org/help/Content/02_Getting_started/Displaying_DOIs_in_print_and_online.htm">display guidelines for DOIs</a> to reflect this. Instead of <strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057">doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057</a> </strong></strong>we are supposed to show DOIs as <strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057</a></strong></strong>. The problem is that DOIs can contain characters such as “+”, “(“, “.” or “/” that need to be escaped when used as URLs. Some ScienceCard examples include the following:</p><ol><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049(05)80357-0">http://doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049(05)80357-0</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/12.4.357">http://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/12.4.357</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi980175+">http://doi.org/10.1021/bi980175+</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0088:SSCPEO]2.0.CO;2">http://doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0088:SSCPEO]2.0.CO;2</a></li></ol><p>These special characters can create problems when DOIs are used in software programs. ScienceCard for example wants to create links to articles in the format <strong><strong>http://sciencecard.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0088:SSCPEO]2.0.CO;2.xml</strong></strong>, but this function is currently broken.</p><p>One possible solution are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://shortdoi.org/">shortDOIs</a>. Article (3) would for example become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://doi.org/dcp">http://doi.org/dcp</a>, whereas article (4) is rejected as invalid DOI. I would love to use shortDOIs in ScienceCard and other places (e.g. Twitter), but haven’t found an API yet that automatically returns shortDOIs for DOIs.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/26/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">Component DOIs</a> directly link to a figure or table of a paper. This is an underused, but very useful feature, and is for example provided by the <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals. Unfortunately component DOIs can confuse bibliographic databases and make it more difficult to track all the links to a given article. I had to write a little routine to detect component DOIs imported into ScienceCard.</p><p>Articles are sometimes updated or corrected, and many publishers will use a different DOI for the updated article. This is a problem when you want to track all references to this particular article. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020121">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020121</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020181">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020181</a> are for example DOIs for the same <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> article (the latter is the corrected version). <em><em>Nature Precedings</em></em> uses a format that is easier to understand for computers - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npre.2011.4479.3">http://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2011.4479.3</a> is for example a link to the third version of this particular manuscript. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/index.html">CrossMark</a> is a new CrossRef service that will make it easier to track the different versions of a manuscript, including retractions.</p><p>ScienceCard should of course not be limited to journal articles. I’m also interested in other scholarly content, e.g. preprints from <strong><strong>ArXiV</strong></strong> or research datasets from <strong><strong>DataCite</strong></strong>. But I want to first solve the problems with DOIs for journal articles, before I tackle the much bigger problems with uniquely identifying and tracking other scholarly contributions. Science blog posts are a good example. It would be wonderful to track them in ScienceCard, but I don’t see how we can do that before we have a system in place that assigns unique and persistent identifiers to blog posts. For this and other reasons I really want unique identifiers for science blog posts, and we should also think about using DOIs for this purpose.</p><p><strong><strong>Update October 9</strong></strong>: A ScienceCard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://sciencecard.org/articles/804">example</a> of multiple identifiers for the same paper:</p><ul><li>DOI: 10.1007/s10654-011-9572-7</li><li>PubMed ID: 21461943</li><li>PubMed Central ID: 3115050</li><li>Microsoft Academic Search: 48849734</li><li>Mendeley: 5b0023f0-609e-11e0-8f54-0024e8453de6</li><li>Mendeley URL: http://www.mendeley.com/research/informativeness-indices-blood-pressure-obesity-serum-lipids-relation-ischaemic-heart-disease-mortality-huntii-study/</li><li>Scopus: 79959714408</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Metrics for scholarly works are used for evaluation and discovery. The Journal Impact Factor is widely used, but is not the best tool to look at the metrics of an individual article. In the past few years we finally started to have the technology to do article-level metrics (citations, downloads, etc.) and PLoS has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">pushed this concept</a> since at least 2009. I first heard about the PLoS Article-Level Metrics project in a presentation given by Pete Binfield in July 2009, and a month later I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/08/15/plos_one_interview_with_peter_binfield/">interviewed him</a> about this project.</p><p>Article-level metrics are a major step forward from journal-level metrics, but I always wanted to extend this concept to authors. Three events in the past few weeks worked nicely together and made me start an author-level metrics project myself: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://dev.mendeley.com/api-binary-battle">programming contest by Mendeley and PLoS</a> with a September 30 deadline, a hackfest following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> in early September, and two conferences (in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://irisc-workshop.org/irisc2011-helsinki/">Helsinki</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://www.orcid.org/civicrm/event/info?id=2&amp;reset=1">Geneva</a>) in mid-September discussing the value of unique author identifiers for researchers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/sciencecard-500x345.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="sciencecard" width="500" height="345"></figure><p>I’ve taken the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">Open Source Article-Level Metrics API Server</a> from PLoS and added a few important features: metrics by author, additional metrics from Mendeley and Microsoft Academic Search, and a web-based interface that less authors register via their Twitter account. The result is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a>, a website I launched this weekend and today entered for the Mendeley/PLoS Binary Battle contest. ScienceCard currently uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">Microsoft Academic Search</a> to find all papers of a particular author, the next version will allow users to retrieve info about their personal papers from Mendeley.</p><p>Working on ScienceCard has already taught me a lot about the problems we face when doing metrics for scholarly works. Most problems are social and not technical. Digital object identifiers (DOIs) for example have been the standard identifier for journal articles for ten years, but many places (including PubMed, Microsoft Academic Search and Mendeley) want users to use their own identifiers for journal articles. This makes it unnecessarily difficult to find articles and collect metrics. Identifiers for authors are even more complicated. ScienceCard will of course use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> identifiers when they become available in 2012, and I hope that I can make the transition to ORCID easier for ScienceCard users.</p><p>Let me know what you think.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London 2011 Conference</a> was a great event that took place last Friday and Saturday. I was able to celebrate the first <em><em>PLoS Blogs</em></em> anniversary together with community manager <strong><strong>Brian Mossop</strong></strong>, but a detailed conference post will follow later. The blog posts covering the event are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/coverage">here</a>, and the list is growing by the hour.</p><p>On Sunday a few brave souls met at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> offices for the Science Online London hackathon to spend some time on a cool programming project. We were greeted by <strong><strong>Victor Henning</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Jason Hoyt</strong></strong> and quickly came up with a few good ideas. Jason finished work on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://twendeley.ologeez.org/">Twendeley</a>, a cool Twitter/Mendeley mashup that looks for papers mentioned in your Twitter stream and finds relevant articles in Mendeley. I wanted to do some work on the PLoS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">Article-Level Metrics API</a>.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article-Level Metrics</a> looks at the usage and reach of an individual article instead of using the <strong><strong>Journal Impact Factor</strong></strong> as a proxy for the impact of a paper. The PLoS Article-Level Metrics API provides access to some interesting numbers: not only citations, HTML pageviews and PDF downloads, but also social metrics such as number of bookmarks in CiteULike or number of readers in Mendeley.</p><p>But for the hackathon I was not interested in building a tool that talks to the Article-Metrics API. On Sunday morning I had discovered that the PLoS Article-Level Metrics server software is not only available as Open Source software, but is built with <strong><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong></strong>, a programming framework that I’m familiar with. So I thought it would be fun to start improving the software by adding metrics on the author level. And by building your own Article-Level Metrics server, you are not limited to papers published in PLoS journals, or to the kinds of metrics provided by PLoS. Wouldn’t it for example be nice to also include download counts for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a> datasets?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/09/alm2-500x355.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="alm2"></figure><p>With the help of <strong><strong>Kristi Holmes</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></strong> we quickly got the API server up and running, added a few papers and retrieved citation counts from PubMed Central and the number of bookmarks from CiteULike (see above). A few hours later we could add authors, and today I was able to automatically import the first papers by author.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/09/alm-500x274.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="alm"></figure><p>For author-level metrics we of course need a widely used unique author identifier, and an API we can talk to. Otherwise author disambiguation quickly becomes frustrating.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> later this week I will moderate a session on <strong><strong>microattribution</strong></strong>, together with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://www.mikepeel.net/blog/">Mike Peel</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/">Bora Zivkovic</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/gigablog/">Scott Edmunds</a>. I thought that microattribution would be an established concept, so I was surprised to find so little information about it. Wikipedia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microattribution&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">doesn’t know</a> about microattribution. A search in PubMed retrieves only two hits (the 2011 <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em> paper mentioned below and an editorial in the same issue). One of the first mentions of the term appears to be an August 2007 Editorial in <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em> (<strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng0807-931">Compete, collaborate, compel</a></strong></strong>), but at the time the term also included what we today would call data citation. It therefore might be a good idea to try a definition:</p><blockquote>Microattribution ascribes a small scholarly contribution to a particular author.</blockquote><p>Important for this definition is the <strong><strong>small scholarly contribution</strong></strong>, which until now we have been unable to appropriately associate with its contributor. This scholarly contribution is too small to merit a scholarly paper or publication as dataset. And in most cases we have not bothered to provide unique identifiers for the scholarly contribution and/or the author.</p><p>A very good example for where microattribution can be valuable is the description of genetic variation. A March 2011 <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em> paper (<strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.785">Systematic documentation and analysis of human genetic variation in hemoglobinopathies using the microattribution approach</a>) </strong></strong>concluded that microattribution <em><em>demonstrably increased the reporting of human variants, leading to a comprehensive online resource for systematically describing human genetic variation</em></em>. One example described in the paper is the genetic variation in the promoter of the KLF1 erythroid transcription factor, explaining differences in the level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Most of these variants were never published in a paper (the blue squares in the figure).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/08/ng.785-F3-500x305.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="ng.785-F3"><figcaption><strong><strong>Figure 3</strong></strong> <em><em>from Giardine B et al.

There will be ample time for discussion in the microattribution session on Friday, but I’m personally most interested in the next practical steps to move microattribution forward. My background is unique author identifiers (ORCID) and my co-moderators bring in their experience with Wikipedia (Mike Peel), science blog aggregation (Bora Zivkovic) and crowdsourcing of sequencing efforts (Scott Edmunds). Some of the questions that I would like to address in the session are:</p><ol><li>Should all microattribution information be collected in one, several or many places?</li><li>Do we need one, several or many identifier schemes for contributions and authors?</li><li>What level of detail should we allow for microattributions?</li><li>Should microattributions use persistent identifiers?</li><li>Can and should we keep our scholarly contributions separate from other contributions?</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/08/Scientific-Attribution-v.2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Scientific Attribution v.2"></figure><p><em><em>My simplified view of the scholarly record, updated</em></em></p><p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/">have said before</a> that I think that attribution should be separated from evaluation, and I think is also true for microattribution. The main reason is that evaluation is something we still know very little about, and a scholarly record available to everybody will make it much easier to make progress here. I don’t think anybody knows yet what distinguishes a good from a bad microattribution, or whether it is possible to compare the scientific impact of 10 or 100 microattributions to one scholarly paper.</p><p><em><em>Disclaimer: I sit on the Board of Directors of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative which aims to help solve this and related problems.</em></em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first beta of the reference manager Zotero 3.0 was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525045252/http://www.zotero.org/blog/announcing-zotero-3-0-beta-release/">released</a> yesterday. The big news is that Zotero 3.0 no longer only runs within the Firefox browser, but is now also available as a standalone version similar to other reference managers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/zotero-500x328.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="zotero" width="500" height="328"></figure><p>Zotero Connectors integrate with the Chrome and Safari browser.

Users of this blog are not representative of all internet users, and Zotero 3.0 would offer browser support for more than 80% of them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/YNgML-web-browsers-used-by-gobbledygook-readers-august-2011.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="analytics" width="1240" height="1096"></figure><p>Zotero 3.0 is beta software and you should expect bugs. One small problem I discovered is that the German translation is incomplete, e.g. in the menus. But overall Zotero looks and feels very similar to the familiar Zotero 2.1 – just as a standalone version. One new feature I like is duplicate detection, an experimental feature of earlier versions.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2011-08-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I discovered (via a tweet by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/https://twitter.com/#!/ostephens">Owen Stephens</a>) a very interesting document <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names">Personal names around the world</a> that discusses the following question:</p><blockquote>How do people’s names differ around the world, and what are the implications of those differences on the design of forms, databases, ontologies, etc. for the Web?</blockquote><p>The document was written by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://rishida.net/">Richard Ishida</a>, Internationalization Activity Lead at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://www.w3.org/International/">W3C</a> (World Wide Web Consortium). The document was published on July 26, and Richard was seeking comments until August 7 before finalizing the document.</p><p>The document is a good summary how names for people differ around the world, e.g. multiple family names (Spain, Latin America), no family name (Iceland), different ordering of names (China, Korea, Japan), non-latin characters in names (many countries), and other issues.</p><p>The second part of the document makes a few suggestions of how these variations in names could be handled on the web. The text should be required reading for anybody who is designing databases that handle international names – and there are a lot of them. A form that asks for <strong><strong>first name</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>middle initial</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>last name</strong></strong> will just not be appropriate for a lot of people.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/noname.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="noname" width="500" height="500"><figcaption><em><em>Flickr photo by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://www.flickr.com/photos/giantginkgo/37740313/">Giant Gingko</a>.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>I am lucky that my German name doesn’t contain any German umlauts (ä, ö, ü) or the letter ß, so I haven’t had any bad (or funny) experiences with my name. But I know that it can be a big problem for a lot of people. The result is that people end up having several spellings for their name, or write their name in ways that were not intended, e.g. a hyphen between the two family names in Spain. The name is something very personal, and I think the least we can do is to allow people to use their name appropriately.</p><p>Science is probably no better or worse in this regard than other domains. If we are lucky, we find a journal that prints our name correctly, or have a database that understands that ü should be sorted as ue. But for the most part, this seems to be an unresolved issue. And I don’t want everybody to start using a first name and last name in that order and only with ASCII or latin characters. That would be boring. So please start thinking about this issue when you design systems that use personal names, and use the W3C document by Richard Ishida as a starting point.</p><p><em><em>Disclaimer: I sit on the Board of Directors of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative which aims to help solve this and related problems.</em></em></p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/book-review-visualize-this-by-nathan-yau"/>
        <updated>2011-08-13T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In July Wiley published the book <strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111645/http://book.flowingdata.com/">Visualize This – The Flowing Data Guide to Design, Visualization and Statistics</a></strong></strong>. The book is written by <em><em>Nathan Yau</em></em>, and he is of course also behind the popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111645/http://flowingdata.com/">FlowingData</a> blog about the same topic. This is a short review of the book.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/visualize-this-drop.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Visualize This" width="304" height="383"></figure><p>Please keep in mind that I’m no expert in data visualization. The book is written for people like me, an expert in the topic will probably look at the book differently.</p><p>And the book is intended as an introduction to important concepts. It is probably the wrong book if you are interested in using a particular tool – e.g. Adobe Illustrator, R or Flash – for Data Visualization.</p><p>The examples in the book are about topics similar to those used in the FlowingData blog, most of them are about data journalism. This is not a book about visualization of scientific experiments.</p><p>The first chapter of the book talks about how to tell stories with data. This is a very important chapter, as learning how to tell a good story is more important than knowing all the details on how to use a tool for visualization.</p><p>Nathan continues with a chapter on how to find and format data for data visualization. We are then introduced to a number of important visualization tools, and their particular strengths. Nathan uses a large number of tools in the book, but seems to particularly like Python for formatting data, R for for calculation and visualization, and Adobe Illustrator for perfecting the result for publication. This is one of the take-home messages of the book for me: instead of perfecting the use of one particular tool, learn to decide what works best for a particular problem. R and Illustrator are a good start for most problems.</p><p>The next few chapters look at visualizations in different contexts: patterns over time, proportions, relationships, differences and spatial relationships. All chapters are written with examples that you can follow along, and with enough basic information that you can start solving similar problems on your own. Below is a chart I tried myself after reading the book. It looks at the number of member organizations of the non-profit ORCID over time (more info <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111645/http://www.orcid.org/news/250-participating-organizations-have-joined-orcid">here</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/orcid-500x400.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="orcid" width="500" height="400"></figure><p>I can highly recommend <strong><strong>Visualize This</strong></strong> to anybody interested in learning about data visualization. I found only two things I didn’t like. I wish Nathan had spent more time explaining how a data graph can be improved visually. In many examples he shows how small changes in color or font size can make a big difference in presentation, but I would prefer to see a more systematic approach to this important topic. I wouldn’t mind if he would drop the chapter on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face">Chernoff faces</a> instead – fun stuff, but not really important in an introductory text.</p><p>My other problem is with the publisher. I read the book as ePub on my iPad. It is nice to have web links you can click in the text, but it would have been even nicer if the ePub had ben prepared with a little bit more care. Most images in the text (there are many) are too small – in an ePub you expect figures to enlarge and show more detail when you click on them. And figure headings were regularly orphaned (on a different page than the figure itself). ePub is an evolving standard, but a little bit of consideration for typography and layout would go a long way.</p>]]></content>

The stated purpose of this tool is to allow researchers to calculate their citation metrics, e.g. their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2007/08/17/do_you_know_your_hirsch_number/">Hirsch index</a> (H-index).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/SafariSnapshot001-500x306.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="SafariSnapshot001" width="500" height="306"></figure><p>This is an interesting new service, that not only helps with calculating citation metrics, but also shows you who is citing your papers – a great discovery tool. Signup to Google Scholar Citations is currently limited, but I was able to create a profile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N05QljgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</p><p>The problem? We have this service already. <strong><strong>Scopus</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Researcher ID</strong></strong> and others have provided this information for some time, and Google Scholar Citations looks very much like a response to the recently launched Microsoft Academic Search:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/SafariSnapshot002-500x349.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="SafariSnapshot002" width="500" height="349"></figure><p>Will we soon see a similar offering from <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>ResearchGate</strong></strong>? There is of course nothing wrong with competition, and there is no reason why we can’t have more than one place that provides researcher profiles. But as I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/">argued before</a>,</p><p><strong><strong>Systems that measure and evaluate scientific contributions can and should be separate from the databases that hold the scholarly record.</strong></strong></p><p>It is not only a waste of resources (both Google Scholar’s and the individual researchers’ who maintain their profiles) to many many different bibliographic databases, but it also makes it impossible to compare citation metrics. In the examples above Alonzo Church has a H-index of 19 at Google Scholar, but only 11 at Microsoft Academic Search (and probably again a different one somewhere else). This means that we can only use an H-index when we mention where (and when) it was calculated.</p><p>The better solution is a common <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://3lib.org/">open bibliography</a>, and the difference between the various service would be how they calculate the citation metric or present the bibliographic data – you can see the different approaches taken by Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search in the screenshots above. This is a difficult task, but not impossible to do. The first step would be to realize that having a common open bibliography would create tremendous value for everybody as we can start building tools on top this bibliography without requiring to collect all the bibliographic data ourselves. We see something like this happening in smaller domains, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/04/29/web-tools-for-searching-the-biomedical-literature-part-i/">tools using the PubMed database</a> are a good example.</p><p>From a researcher perspective it makes little sense to have many different places where you can maintain your publications. It makes much more sense to do this once and then see the information reused in different services. This is the approach the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID initiative is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://www.orcid.org/principles">taking</a>:</p><p><strong><strong>All profile data contributed to ORCID by researchers or claimed by them will be available in standard formats for free download (subject to the researchers’ own privacy settings) that is updated once a year and released under the CC0 waiver.</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>Disclaimer: I sit on the Board of Directors of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative which aims to help solve this and related problems.</em></em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Other blog posts often provide important background material for your own posts, and they are typically cited by <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">inline links</a> in the text. But sometimes we need more formal citations, e.g. when citing blog posts in a journal article or when providing a bibliography. But how do you properly cite a blog post?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4534468843_176c790812.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="APA" loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ccacnorthlib/4534468843/">Flickr picture</a> by CCAC North Library.</em></p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.apastyle.org/">APA Style</a> – from the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association – suggests the following format:</p><p><strong>Fenner, M.H.</strong> (2011, January 23). Beyond the PDF … is ePub [Web log post]. Retrieved from <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a></p><p>This is a good start, but I think the citation should include the name of the blog. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Chicago Manual of Style</a> does this:</p><p><strong>Fenner, M.H., </strong>“Beyond the PDF … is ePub,” Gobbledygook, January 23, 2011, <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a></p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.library.illinois.edu/learn/tutorials/mla.html">MLA Style</a> also mentions the Publisher, and the date the blog post was accessed (in addition to the publication date):</p><p><strong>Fenner, M.H.</strong> “Beyond the PDF … is ePub”. <em>Gobbledygook</em>. PLoS Blogs. January 23, 2011. Web. July 21, 2011. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a> </p><p>This is a little bit too much for me. There is an argument to use the accession date for web content, but having two dates can be confusing and the publication date is more important. I personally prefer a citation format that looks very similar to a journal article citation (and comes closest to the Chicago Manual of Style):</p><p><strong>Fenner, M.H. </strong>Beyond the PDF … is ePub. <em>Gobbledygook</em>, January 23, 2011. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a></p><p>If we want to include blog posts in a reference list, we also have to think about the formatting. In <strong>BibTeX</strong>a blog entry would look like this:</p><p>@misc{ author = {Fenner, Martin}, title = {Beyond the PDF … is ePub}, journal = {Gobbledygook}, type = {Blog}, number = {January 23}, year = {2011}, howpublished = {\url{https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/}}</p><p><strong>BibTeX</strong> doesn’t have an entry type for blog posts, so we have to use @misc and use the type field. @unpublished is an alternative, but that is a strange name. We have to put the URL into the howpublished field, which is also awkward.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp">RIS</a> is another popular format, and knows about blogs and URLs:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><pre>

A modern reference format should use HTML or XML so that it can be embedded directly in the blog post.

How this BlogPosting above looks in a blog obviously depends on the CSS styling used, without any styling it looks like this:</p><p>Fenner, Martin<br>Beyond the PDF … is ePub<br>Gobbledygook<br>01/23/11<br><a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/</a></p><p>With a little work on the CSS for this blog, the citation could look exactly as shown above, but with added semantic information that is understood by search engines and other tools. It is clear to me that HTML-based standards such as Schema.org are the future for embedding citation information in blog posts. We need better tools to make this process as painless as possible.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brendan Thomas has published an interesting paper that looks at author email addresses in the PubMed database of biomedical literature. Email addresses of first authors have been added to PubMed since 1996, and they can be retrieved via the standard web interface or automated software. This makes PubMed an excellent place to find the email address of an academic author, but also shows that PubMed is very vulnerable to email address harvesting.</p><p>The problem is not limited to PubMed; this is also an issue with many scholarly journals. Email addresses are used as contact information in scholarly papers, and they are commonly displayed on journal webpages. You can harvest email addresses from <em><em>NEJM</em></em>, <em><em>Science</em></em> or <em><em>PLoS</em></em> webpages, and you don’t even need a subscription. <em><em>JAMA</em></em> is hiding the email address, and <em><em>Nature</em></em> is providing an author contact form. Both journals provide the email address in the PDF.</p><p>Most journals provide the postal address of corresponding authors. Journals added email addresses in the 1990s, and this of course has become the preferred method of communication among scientists – when was the last time you received a postcard for a reprint request? Unfortunately we have long learned that it is no longer safe to make email addresses publicly available – more than 90% of email traffic is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043917/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/spam/">spam</a>.</p><p>Journal publishers have to rethink their policies regarding contact information of their authors. And authors should demand from journals that their email addresses are treated with more respect for privacy. There are better ways to provide contact information for corresponding authors, and I don’t mean a link to their Twitter account or LinkedIn profile. Journal publishers should create author profile pages that not only list all publications of a particular author, but also the relevant contact information. There should be contact forms instead of plain email addresses, and authors should be able to control what information is displayed in their author profile. Author profiles of course can be further extended in many ways, from links to publications with other publishers to author-level metrics.</p><p><em><em>Disclaimer: I sit on the Board of Directors of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative which aims to help solve this and related problems.</em></em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><strong><strong>Thomas, B.</strong></strong> (2011).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blogging is a <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/conference_blogging_interview_with_alex_knoll/">great format </a>to report from conferences. The regular blog format works best for posts written at the end of the day – unless you are typing really fast. Microblogging, i.e. a number of short or very short posts by a group of people, works better for live blogging of an event and has become very popular.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100409/http://www.friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> was probably the first widely used microblogging tool for scientific conferences starting in 2008, and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">January 2009 paper </a>describes the experience at 2008 ISMB conference in Toronto. By late 2009 Twitter had surpassed FriendFeed in popularity, and at some point in 2010 most people seemed to have switched from FriendFeed to Twitter for conference microblogging.</p><p>Twitter is a great tool in many ways, but is far from perfect for conferences. The biggest problem is that the tweets about a particular topic aren’t really connected. Hashtags help to find tweets about a particular conference, but hashtags for a particular session have never cught on. This makes it very difficult to have a real discussion, or to find related messages later on.</p><p>Facebook is not only extremely popular, but has also taken many of the features of FriendFeed. But for some reason it has not become a popular conference microblogging tool for scientists. I think this is because many people use Facebook primarily for their social interactions, and keep those separate from their professional discussions.</p><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> was released last week, and the services has many of the features of FriendFeed and Facebook (who bought FriendFeed in August 2009, one of the reasons the service has never become that popular). Google+ allows discussions around a particular message (post, tweet?). It doesn’t have groups about a particular topic (e.g. conference), and doesn’t yet understand a concept similar to hashtags. The service looks very nice from a desktop computer, but the mobile version for iPhone and iPad isn’t very polished (I haven’t tested the Android app).</p><p>The experience from Twitter tells me that the most important feature for a great conference microblogging tool is popularity, and this is only partly related to the technology behind the service. There are already a good number of science bloggers and other Science 2.0 folks on Google+ and we have seen some good discussions (e.g. a <a href="https://plus.google.com/106537123721037364937/posts/buxDWrvq8vU#106537123721037364937/posts/buxDWrvq8vU">discussion about conference microblogging</a>), so that is a very good sign. But the experience with Google Wave (<a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/what_comes_after_google_wave/">discontinued</a>) and Google Buzz (not that many people seem to use it) makes me a bit cautious, and I will wait how Google+ evolves in the coming months before I get too exited.</p><p>Update: Added a paragraph about Facebook.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/annotum-publishing-with-wordpress-soon-coming-to-a-journal-near-you"/>
        <updated>2011-06-30T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week the first <a href="http://annotum.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/alpha-release/">Alpha</a> version of <strong><strong>Annotum</strong></strong> was released. <a href="http://annotum.wordpress.com/about/">Annotum</a> is “a scholarly authoring and publishing platform based on WordPress”. I <a href="http://river-valley.tv/annotem-an-open-source-journal-authoring-and-publishing-platform-based-on-wordpress/">first learned</a> about Annotum at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop in January. One of the themes of the workshop was that we need better tools for authoring, reviewing and publishing of scholarly articles. For many at the workshop it was obvious that these tools should be web-based, use HTML as the file format, and should use readily available tools whenever possible.</p><p>WordPress is a perfect candidate for such a tool, but needs to be extended with functions required for scholarly articles: better handling of citations, figures and tables, support of standard document formats such as <a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM-DTD</a>, and support of  a review workflow with co-authors, editors and reviewers. WordPress can easily be extended with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092155/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">plugins</a>, and a good number of plugins have been released for scholars. A good starting point are plugins tagged <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/res-comms">res-comms</a> and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wordpress-for-scientists">WordPress for Scientists</a> Google Group.</p><p>There is one problem with these scholarly plugins: none of them offers a complete solution, and it is sometimes tricky to make them work with other required plugins or with each other (a particular problem are plugins that use Javascript). This means that there is currently no out-of-the-box solution to create, review and publish scholarly content with WordPress.</p><p><strong><strong>Annotum</strong></strong> is an ambitious project that wants to change this. It helps that Annotum seems to have sufficient funding and commitment to launch a production version later this year – rather than being the part-time effort of a single developer. Technically it is a WordPress theme, and not a plugin. Themes normally are responsible for the look of a WordPress site, but they can also contain functions normally found in plugins. Installing a single theme is much easier for the average WordPress user than installing a number of plugins plus a theme that works with all plugins. BTW, themes can have child themes, so this doesn’t mean that all Annotum sites will look the same.</p><p>Annotum of course can’t do everything by itself and has to work with existing plugins (it took me only one hour to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092155/http://blogs.xartrials.org/annotum/article/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications/">make it work</a> with my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092155/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">ePub Export</a> plugin). Annotum’s Carl Leubsdorf is part of the WordPress for Scientists community and I think he will make sure that Annotum will work well with the plugins already out there.</p><p>I hope that Annotum will not only become a nice out-of-the-box solution to create a WordPress-based journal or science blog, but will also be a big stimulus for the budding community of scholarly WordPress users and developers.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three leading funding organizations today made this important <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2011/WTVM051897.htm">announcement</a>:</p><blockquote>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust announced today that they are to support a new, top-tier, open access journal for biomedical and life sciences research.</blockquote><p>Some features of the new journal:</p><ul><li>open access</li><li>name of journal to be decided</li><li>aims to attract and define the very best research publications</li><li>papers will be accepted or rejected as rapidly as possible</li><li>first issue expected for summer of 2012</li><li>editor-in-chief and editorial team will be active scientists</li><li>journal will enable improved data presentation</li><li>long-term business model to be developed, the three organisations made a commitment to cover initial costs</li></ul><p>This is an important announcement, as the journal has the potential to have a major impact on publishing biomedical research. Two aspects of the announcement surprise me: many details about the new journal have not been decided, I would have expected at least a decision about the journal name and Editor-in-Chief. And from the few details in the announcement the new journal appears to take a fairly conservative approach to publishing. You could for example compare today’s press release with the editorial explaining the launch of PLoS Biology from October 2003 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036">Why PLoS became a Publisher</a>). This approach is understandable as most scientists are conservative and don’t care much about new publishing technologies or even open access; they only care about having their research accepted in a journal with high impact. Publishing this kind of journal – which usually means high rejection rates and time-consuming editorial work – is difficult with with an author-pays business model. The deep pockets of the three funding organizations change this equation.</p><p>Earlier this year we saw the the announcements of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/06/new-journal-nature-one-launched-today/">Scientific Reports</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.d1190">BMJ Open</a> and similar high volume open access journals that follow the success of PLoS ONE (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://www.slideshare.net/PBinfield/ssp-presentation4">PLoS ONE and the Rise of the Open Access Mega Journal</a>). The new journal announced today takes a very different approach to open access publishing.</p><p>This announcement has of course also been discussed elsewhere, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2011/06/new-openaccess-journals-welcome.html">The Tree of Life</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://cameronneylon.net/default/a-new-sustainability-model-major-funders-to-support-oa-journal/">Science in the Open</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://bytesizebio.net/index.php/2011/06/27/suggest-a-name-for-the-next-big-journal/">Byte Size Biology</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2011/06/27/top-tiered-open-access-journal-arrives-with-fanfare-few-details/">Scholarly Kitchen</a></li></ul>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/is-schema-org-about-a-technical-standard-or-about-something-else"/>
        <updated>2011-06-19T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the month Google, Bing and Yahoo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/06/07/schema-org-for-scholarly-html/">announced</a> schema.org, a new initiative for structured markup on the web. Richard MacManus responded with a critical piece at ReadWriteWeb (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/is_schemaorg_really_a_google_land_grab.php">Is Schema.org really a Google Land Grab?</a>), mainly criticizing that the initiative didn’t use RDFa and didn’t seem to have consulted with the web standards body W3C. The best discussion about schema.org that I found so far (via Eric Hellman’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2011/06/our-metadata-overlords-and-that.html">post</a>) is by Henri Sivonen (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://hsivonen.iki.fi/schema-org-and-communities/">Schema.org and Pre-Existing Communities</a>). He explains why he thinks it makes sense that schema.org picked microdata over RDFa or microformats as markup standard. And he discusses how the web community has developed standards in the past and what characterizes the successful efforts. I personally believe that schema.org will bring us closer to the semantic web, and the discussion reminds me a little bit of the discussion around HTML 5 vs. XHTML 2 (where the pragmatic solution supported by the major browser vendors won over the ideal but dogmatic solution discussed for many years in standards bodies). Schema.org is will certainly be discussed at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/start">Science Online London Conference</a> in September.</p><p>Whether schema.org becomes a success depends in large part on the adoption by the community. Schema.org is backed by the three largest search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo), so everybody who wants to be found by them will take a close look at the standard. Scholarly content is for the most part collected and curated in specialized databases. This makes it not only a technical decision whether or not to adopt schema.org for markup (we need more and better defined scholarly data types in the standard), but also a business decision. If scholarly publishers start marking up their journal articles, they will be easier to find via Google, Bing, etc. But will this mean that institutions would start re-evaluating their subscriptions to commercial services like Scopus or Web of Science? And will schema.org help or hinder the very large market of discovery tools for scholarly content?</p><p>At this point this is very much a theoretical discussion. We first need better scholarly data types in the schema.org standard. The Association of Educational Publishers and Creative Commons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://www.aepweb.org/mediacenter/AEP-CC-Schema_6-7-11.htm">has announced</a> an initiative to create a metadata framework for educational resources based on schema.org. And we hopefully see a similar initiative from scholarly publishers. I hope that the group behind schema.org is open to this input.</p>]]></content>

I am again one of the organizers (together with <em><em>Lou Woodley</em></em> from Nature.com and <em><em>Kaitlin Thaney</em></em> from Digital Science), and I’m getting both excited and nervous the closer we get to September.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557im_/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/images/solo11.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Science Online London 2011"><figcaption>Photo by Mendeley.com (if you look really hard, you can find me in this picture from the 2010 conference).</figcaption></figure><p>We have recently posted a first draft of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.html">conference program</a>, and you can see that we are trying something new. In addition to the keynotes, panel discussions and breakout sessions we had the last few years we have also scheduled four workshops for the second day of the conference. I’m doing a workshop called <strong><strong>Beyond scholarly publication</strong></strong> together with <em><em>Eva Amsen</em></em> (The Node) and <em><em>Mark Hahnel</em></em> (FigShare). The idea is to really have a hands-on experience, and in this workshop we will focus on blogs and related tools. We will try to do something interesting both for someone who wants to start a science blog, but also for more experienced writers (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">ePub</a>). We haven’t work out the details, so please drop us a note if there is a particular topic that you want to see covered. All workshops will focus on <strong><strong>Spinal Muscular Atrophy</strong></strong> as a theme, and we hope that everybody has learned a few tricks by the end of the day.</p><p>We are still looking for breakout session suggestions for the first day of the conference. If you have a good idea, please add it to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/">wiki</a>, as we hope to have a program that is (close to) final by July.</p>]]></content>

Websites that use this schema to markup their data (more than 100 data types are supported) will make it easier for the three largest web search engines to find their content. Schema.org uses microdata, not microformats or RDFa, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/docs/faq.html#15">FAQ</a> this was a pragmatic decision.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/schema-500x456.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="schema" width="500" height="456"></figure><p>Schema.org also defines the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">ScholarlyArticle</a>, but unfortunately this data type doesn’t add any properties beyond those of the parent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/Article">Article</a> (e.g. the Digital Object Identifier). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://www.schema.org/Person">Person</a> data type is also interesting (and uses a professor as an example), but for example doesn’t include an <strong><strong>isAuthor</strong></strong> relationship.</p><p>It will be interesting to see whether future versions of the schema.org standard will have better support for scholarly content, and how well this microformat can be integrated into our efforts to create <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>. And how quickly scholarly publishers and other providers of scholarly content will adopt this new standard., which in its current form already is a big improvement over plain HTML.</p><p><em>Update (6/7/11): Google today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/06/authorship-markup-and-web-search.html">announced</a> support for authorship markup, either via the schema.org format or using the <strong><strong>rel</strong></strong> attribute.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ten days ago I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/04/29/web-tools-for-searching-the-biomedical-literature-part-i/">mentioned </a>a paper by Zhiyong Lu that gives an overview over the available web tools to search the biomedical literature. Most of these tools enhance the PubMed service, and Zhiyong Lu in fact works for the NCBI, the developer of PubMed. In this post I want to take a more detailed look at the available tools.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/05/pubmed-500x177.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="pubmed"></figure><p>A good starting point is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/search/">companion webpage</a> to the paper, listing 28 services. One of the most painful shortcomings of PubMed is the sorting of results by date. Zhiyong lists 8 tools that can present search results sorted by relevance. Semantic search, seeking relevant concepts, and visualization of search results are all offered by several tools. Three tools will identify similar publications, and three tools will find potential experts, reviewers or collaborators. It is a good sign that there are so many tools that integrate with PubMed – in addition to the reference managers (e.g. Endnote, Papers) that do the same.</p><p>The analysis has one important shortcoming: only tools that specifically cover the biomedical literature are discussed. General purpose search tools such as <strong><strong>Web of Science</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Scopus</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Google Scholar</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>Microsoft Academic Search</strong></strong> are therefore not covered, neither are online bibliographic tools such as <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>CiteULike</strong></strong>. All of them also include biomedical literature – although the coverage at the fairly new Microsoft Academic Search is still limited. They all offer unique features not found in Pubmed or the 28 tools discussed in the paper.</p><p>When I think about how I find interesting articles, then it is increasingly through my social networks - including this paper by Zhiyong Lu. His paper unfortunatel fails to discuss this important search strategy. Twitter, FriendFeed, science blogs, etc. are strange places to find interesting literature, but they work for me. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://www.massgenomics.org/2011/04/whole-genome-sequencing-for-cancer-patients.html">This April 22 post</a> on the wonderful <strong><strong>Massgenomics</strong></strong> blog alerted me to two interesting papers published in JAMA on April 20 that describe the use of whole-genome sequencing in the care of two patients with acute leukemia. I presented the paper by Welch et al. in a journal club last Friday and we had a very interesting discussion.</p><p>The paper has also been discussed in the following places: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://nnlm.gov/pnr/dragonfly/2011/02/15/beyondpubmed/">Dragonfly</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://cmch.typepad.com/cmch/2011/03/res.html">Center on Media and Child Health</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://beckerinfo.net/scp/2011/04/29/pubmed-and-beyond-a-survey-of-web-tools-for-searching-biomedical-literature/">Bernard Becker Medical Library</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/3rd-call-for-submissions-for-medical-information-matters-tools-for-searching-the-biomedical-literature/">Medical Information Matters</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://autoimmunbuch.de/?p=447">Friendly Fire</a> (German), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://usalbiomedica.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/pubmed-and-beyond-a-survey-of-web-tools-for-searching-biomedical-literature/">Usalbiomedica </a>(Spanish).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zhiyong Lu recently published an excellent overview of the web tools that are currently available to search the biomedical literature. The article has also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610131235/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/search/">companion web page</a> that allows user to filter for the features they are interested in, and to report new tools.</p><p>The author describes 28 tools developed specifically for the biomedical domain. The tools are grouped based on their most important features into</p><ol><li>Ranking search results</li><li>Clustering results into topics</li><li>Extracting and displaying semantics and relations</li><li>Improving search interface and retrieval experience</li></ol><p>Zhiyong Lu works for the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). NCBI developed and maintains PubMed, and this is obviously the database to which the other tools are compared. Or looked at this differently, the proliferation of tools in the four areas listed above is an indication of the areas where PubMed is not very good at (e.g. it returns search results not by relevance, but in chronological order).</p><p>Instead of reviewing the article, I decided to do this in two parts. I will write about my thoughts on the various tools next week to give everybody time to look at this themselves.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The history of HTML begins 1989 at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</a>, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva. <strong><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Robert Cailliau</strong></strong> and colleagues invented HTML (as well as the transport protocol HTTP and the web browser) to facilitate collaboration between CERN physicists.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/4268841912_c2b34ca43c.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="HTML" loading="lazy" width="500" height="281"><figcaption><em><em>HTML by nidhug at Flickr.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>HTML was originally invented for scholarly communication, but of course by the mid-1990s was also used by everybody else. But when electronic distribution of scholarly journal articles became possible, most publishers switched to PDF instead of HTML as the electronic document format of choice.</p><p>In April 2003 Inera, Mulberry Technologies and the NCBI published the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite</a> (NLM-DTD, read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://old.diglib.org/preserve/hadtdfs.pdf">here </a>about the history of this DTD Suite). The NLM-DTD has become the de facto XML standard for scholarly publishing and archiving. Although some tools for authors can write articles in this format (including Microsoft Word with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/">Article Authoring Add-In</a>), the NLM-DTD has never caught on as an authoring format for scholars and I’m not aware of any publisher accepting manuscripts written in this format.</p><p>In April 2009  <em><em>Learned Publishing</em></em> published a paper by <strong><strong>David Shotton</strong></strong> titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/2009202" rel="cito:discusses">Semantic publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal publishing</a>. David listed six rules for semantic publishers:</p><ol><li>Start simply and improve functionality incrementally.</li><li>Expect greater things of your authors.</li><li>Exploit your existing in-house skills fully.</li><li>Use established standards wherever possible.</li><li>Publish raw datasets to the Web.</li><li>Release article metadata, particularly reference lists, in machine-readable form.</li></ol><p>Although the paper focusses on scholarly publishers, these rules also very much apply to what we could call Scholarly HTML today.</p><p>At about the same time (March 31, 2009) <strong><strong>Peter Sefton</strong></strong> for the first time used the term <em><em>Scholarly HTML</em></em> in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">blog post</a>. He thinks that Scholarly HTML should allow the following:</p><ol><li>Documents should definitely have headings.</li><li>Protocols for representing things like examples.</li><li>Metadata, using a linked data approach.</li><li>Links from terms mentioned in the text to ontologies that describe them.</li><li>Linkable paragraphs.</li><li>Dead simple reference management via links to trusted sources.</li></ol><p>In January 2011 <strong><strong>Phil Bourne</strong></strong> organized the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop, and I was lucky to attend. We had a number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://river-valley.tv/conferences/beyondthepdf-2011">interesting sessions </a>about how to improve the current scholarly paper published as PDF. I was involved in the working group thinking about better authoring tools, and one of my personal conclusions was that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">ePub</a> is a very interesting alternative to PDF if we need a packing format for HTML, e.g. for journal submission or archiving.</p><p><strong><strong>Peter Murray-Rust</strong></strong> was able to capture the ideas of the authoring working group with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/02/09/scholarly-html-hackfest-cambridge-uk-march/">drawing</a>, and he picked the term <em><em>Scholarly HTML</em></em> as the best description of what we want to achieve. He subsequently invited Peter Sefton, Brian McMahon and me (and a number of other people interested in Scholarly HTML) to a workshop that took place last weekend in Cambridge. Some of the thoughts of Peter Murray-Rust and Peter Sefton are summarized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/14/scholarly-html-%e2%80%93-major-progress/">here </a>and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://ptsefton.com/2011/03/18/scholarly-html-fraglets-of-progress.htm">here</a>. Two outcomes of the workshop are Scholarly HTML <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-principles">Principles </a>and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-faqs">FAQ</a>.</p><p>My approach to Scholarly HTML is through developing WordPress plugins. The future will hopefully bring of a number of Scholarly HTML authoring tools, and WordPress will be just one of them. But Wordpress is a great platform to test ideas and improve them over time, or to quote David Shotton: <em><em>start simply and improve functionality incrementally</em></em>. One starting point has been citations in Scholarly HTML and we have already made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-citations">good progress</a>.</p><p>The idea behind Scholarly HTML is not to build alternatives for Microsoft Word or LaTeX for authoring, but instead to build tools that will allow us to do something new and exciting with scholarly content. The trick here is to improve the scholarly document – and the author should see the immediate benefit - without putting too much extra burden on the author. And this might in fact be the big challenge for Scholarly HTML.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The best and quickest discussions of a scientific paper now sometimes happen in science blogs rather than in the peer-reviewed literature. Whereas we have a number of scholarly databases that track citations between papers, we don’t have the same tools for science blogs. Following all science blogs manually has simply become impossible (unless your first name is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://coturnix.org/">Bora</a>). This makes it difficult to find all blog posts about a particular paper  - either for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/08/27/supplementary_information_should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/">proper discussion</a> of an article or for doing automated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/15/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">article-level metrics</a>.</p><h3 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h3><p>Aggregation can help solve this problem. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://www.researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging</a> aggregates blog posts about peer-reviewed research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://scienceseeker.org/">ScienceSeeker</a> aggregates all science blog posts (currently aggregating over 400 blogs) and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/">announced</a> in February. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature Blogs</a> also aggregates science blogs, but doesn’t seem to be up-to-date.</p><h3 id="microformats">Microformats</h3><p>Microformats are an alternative – but of course complimentary – strategy. Microformats are small snippets of HTML that represent commonly published things. A good example is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license">Rel-License</a>, a microformat indicating licensed content:</p><pre><code>&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" rel="license"&gt;cc by 2.0&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p>In February Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/2011/02/24/google-launches-microformat-powered-recipe-search">launched</a> a new Recipe view feature based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/wiki/hrecipe">hRecipe</a> microformat, demonstrating how microformats can help discovering content. There is currently no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/14/scholarly-html-%E2%80%93-major-progress/">standard microformat for scholarly citations</a>. The simplest format would again use the <strong><strong>rel</strong></strong> tag – together with the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/14/how-to-use-citation-typing-ontology-cito-in-your-blog-posts/">CiTO</a>):</p><pre><code>&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1197258" rel="cito:discusses"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/1/S1/S6/table/T1">more than 20</a> CiTO tags for describing what we think about a particular paper or science blog post – many science bloggers would probably have used <em><em>cito:critiques</em></em> for the above paper. I suggest <em><em>cito:discusses</em></em> as the standard CiTO relationship for most papers and blog posts. You can add this tag manually, or use a tool such as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-to-link/">Link to Link</a> WordPress plugin (I added <em><em>cito:discusses</em></em> to version 1.1.2).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The reference management software <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> has been a regular topic on this blog. I wrote about Papers in one of my first blog posts in May 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/03/interview_with_alexander_griekspoor/">interviewed</a> main developer Alex Griekspoor in October 2008, and held a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/19/papers_for_iphone_released_time_for_more_poetry/">poetry contest</a> when Papers for iPhone was released in February 2009 (Stephen Curry won the first price for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/19/papers_for_iphone_released_time_for_more_poetry/#comment-898">this poem</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/03/Papers-2c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Papers 2c"></figure><p>Today Papers 2 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://news.mekentosj.com/">was released</a>, and with this major update Papers has grown into a full-fledged reference manager for the Macintosh (there is no Windows or Linux version). Papers 1 was released in 2007 as a tool to manage the PDF files of scholarly papers on your hard drive. Papers 1 did this job very well, but it was not a reference manager in the strict sense, because you couldn’t use Papers to insert citations into the manuscripts you were writing.</p><p>In order to add this feature, Papers first had to be completely rewritten to not only handle journal articles and the associated PDF files, but also all the other common reference formats – conference proceeding, book chapter, website, etc. A nice side effect that I haven’t fully explored yet is that Papers can now also store all your Powerpoint or Keynote presentations (but fulltext search in these presentations doesn’t seem to work yet).</p><p>Inserting references into manuscripts is done using a floating window activated from the menu bar or with a shortcut:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/papers2-500x475.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="papers2" width="500" height="475"></figure><p>This feature works similar to the plugins used by Endnote, Mendeley, Zotero, etc., but in typical Papers fashion the implementation is much nicer. The plugin is available to all applications, e.g. other word processors besides Microsoft Word, your blogging software or your email program.</p><p>The other big limitation of Papers 1 wasn’t so obvious when Papers originally launched in 2007. But today most major reference managers allow users to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/reference-manager-overview/">share their references</a> in private and/or public groups, as most research is done in groups and most manuscripts are written by multiple authors.</p><p>The sharing feature of Papers 2 is called <strong><strong>Livfe</strong></strong>. It is not as complete as the sharing features of some other reference managers (e.g. CiteULike or Mendeley). It is for example not yet possible to upload a complete Papers library to Livfe. And Livfe doesn’t have a web interface, but only works through Papers.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/03/Papers-2a-500x243.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Papers 2a"></figure><p>The difference between Papers 2 and other reference managers is not so much the feature set. What sets Papers really apart is the love that went into the design of the program. Papers doesn’t just get the job done, it allows you to have fun searching for references or reading – and now also writing – a paper. This makes Papers 2 a strong competitor against some of the other established programs that for example have more than 25 years of experience with reference management (Endnote), think that reference management should be done as Open Source software (Zotero), do everything in the browser (Refworks), or see reference management primarily as a social application (Mendeley).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The bibliography of a scholarly paper is interesting and important reading material. You can see whether the authors have cited the relevant literature, and you often find references to interesting papers you didn’t know about. Bibliographies are obviously also needed to count citations, and then do all kinds of useful and not so useful things with them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/5124103273_968a3c50cc.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Bibliography" loading="lazy" width="319" height="500"><figcaption><em><em>Bibliography by quinn.anya at Flickr.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately almost all bibliographies are in the wrong format. What you want is at least a direct link to the cited work using the DOI (if available), and a lot of journals do that. You don’t want to have a link to PubMed using the PubMed ID as the only option (as in PubMed Central), as this requires a few more mouse clicks to get to the full-text article. And you don’t want to go to an extra page, then use a link to search the PubMed database, and then use a few more mouse clicks to get to the full-text article (something that could happen to you with a PLoS journal).</p><p>A bibliography should really be made available in a downloadable format such as BibTeX. Unfortunately journal publishers – including Open Access publishers – in most cases don’t see that they can provide a lot of value here without too much extra work. One of the few publishers offering this service is BioMed Central – feel free to mention other journals that do the same in the comments.</p><p>This weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/04/scholarly-html-hackfest-and-visit-of-peter-sefton-and-martin-fenner/">Peter Murray-Rust invited Peter Sefton and me to Cambridge </a>(UK) for a very interesting workshop about <strong><strong>Scholarly HTML</strong></strong>. Our goal is to discuss how we can define standards and build tools to make HTML the best platform for scholars and scholarly works. The event is in fact a hackfest, and we hope to have something to show by Sunday evening.</p><p>My idea for the hackfest is a tool that extracts all links (references and weblinks) out of a HTML document (or URL) and creates a bibliography. The generated bibliography should be both in HTML (using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">Citation Style Language</a> ) and BibTex formats, and should ideally also support the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/14/how-to-use-citation-typing-ontology-cito-in-your-blog-posts/">CiTO</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://ocoins.info/">COinS </a>-  a standard to embed bibliographic metadata in HTML. I will use PHP as a programming language and will try to build both a generic tool and something that can work as a WordPress plugin. Obviously I will not start from scratch, but will reuse several already existing libraries. Any feedback or help for this project is much appreciated.</p><p>If I had a tool with which I could create my own bibliographies (and in the formats I want), I would no longer care so much about journals not offering this service. One big problem would still persist, and that is that most subscription journals wouldn’t allow the redistribution of the bibliographies to their papers. A single citation can’t have a copyright, but a compilation of citations can. I’m sure we will also discuss this topic at the workshop, as Peter Murray-Rust is one of the biggest proponents of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://openbiblio.net/principles/">Open Bibliographic Data</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the annoyances with bibliographies as we use them for scholarly papers is that is usually unclear why a particular paper was cited. It is often possible for readers to gather this information by looking at the citation in the context of the surrounding text, but this is very difficult to automate. A highly cited paper might contain a method that everybody uses, might be a review, or it might contain information that everybody disagrees with. David Shotton has thought a lot about this problem and has come up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-1480-1-S1-S6">CiTO</a>, the Citation Typing Ontology:</p><blockquote>CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology for describing the nature of reference citations in scientific research articles and other scholarly works, both to other such publications and also to Web information resources, and for publishing these descriptions on the Semantic Web.</blockquote><p>Using CiTO obviously means extra work for the author, so for widespread use it is very important that CiTO is as easy to use as possible. The first step would be to reduce the number of possible relationships to a manageable number, e.g. not more than ten (CiTO defines more than 20 relationships). Following a dinner discussion at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop, David Shotton kindly provided 10 popular CiTO relationships to Alex Wade from Microsoft Research and me. I made three little changes to the list: added “cites” as the default generic relationship, dropped “shares authors with”, as this can be done better with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">unique author identifiers</a>, and added “disagrees with” to have at least one relationship that expresses disagreement.</p><p>In the next step I added these relationships to my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/11/having-fun-with-citations-at-scienceonline2011/">Link to Link</a> WordPress plugin, and I released the updated version (1.1) today. Using CiTO is an option that can be turned off, but the plugin makes it very easy to use CiTO relationships when inserting references into a blog post:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/cito-500x433.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="cito" width="500" height="433"></figure><p>The CiTO relationship is stored in the <strong><strong>rel</strong></strong> attribute of the link that is created – currently as free-form text, but this can be changed to the <strong><strong>cito:DisagreesWith</strong></strong> format. This information can easily be extracted by computers, or made available in the bibliography to readers. The Reference Manager CiteULike is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://opencitations.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/use-of-cito-in-citeulike/">also supporting CiTO</a>, but we need many more CiTO tools for authors.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ePub is a great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">format for scholarly content</a>, and there are a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/01/epub-wordpress-plugin-released-today/">number of tools</a> to create ePub files. But creating content is only half the story, at least as important is an easy mechanism for distribution. This is particularly true if your ePub files are not books, but shorter pieces of content: journal articles, blog posts or even output from your ongoing research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> or the related Atom protocol has of course become the standard mechanism to publish frequently updated works.</p><p>Open Publication Syndication System (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://code.google.com/p/openpub/wiki/CatalogSpecDraft#Introduction">OPDS</a>) is a syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom. OPDS is a relatively new format, but is supported by a growing number of (book) publishers, ePub tools and readers. If you want to try OPDS for yourself, pick one the feeds listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://code.google.com/p/openpub/wiki/AvailableFeeds">here</a> and add the feed as a Book source in the Stanza reader (in the <strong><strong>Shared</strong></strong> section). Alternatively, install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://www.epubread.com/de/manual.php">EPUBReader plugin</a> for Firefox. As you can see, OPDS does more than just list titles with a summary and image, you can also categorize the content by author (or tag), and provide a search interface.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/02/OPDS-500x371.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="OPDS"></figure><p>I’m looking forward to the first scholarly publisher that not only provides ePub files of his journal articles, but also makes them available via OPDS. Although OPDS is currently used mostly for electronic books, I think that this is a very interesting protocol for scholarly publishers. Did I mention that OPDS also provides facilities for buying or lending content? And that you probably shouldn’t expect OPDS support in the Apple iBooks application for iPhone and iPad anytime soon as they don’t seem to like distributed content delivery? I would like to see scholarly publishers providing their journal content via ePub and OPDS that can be consumed with one of the many available readers, rather than everybody creating his own little app that only works with a single publisher on a single platform.</p><p>OPDS is a relatively simple protocol and similar to RSS should make it easy for everybody to provide his content in catalog form. It should be straightforward to add OPDS support to the WordPress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">ePub plugin</a> that I released last week, thus making a blog (or blog network) available directly in the ePub reader. While I expect that we will continue to read most blogs via the Web or RSS reader, ePub might be the better format for longer posts and the posts you want to store on your computer.</p><p>ePub is a very interesting format for packaging research objects, e.g. the description and data files from an experiment. OPDS would be very helpful as a distribution mechanism for these ePubs, and also works on the small scale of a research group. You can for example use the Calibre eBook management tool – which can create not only ePub files but also OPDS catalogs – together with Dropbox to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://dearauthor.com/wordpress/2010/02/14/create-your-own-cloud-of-ebooks-with-calibre-calibre-opds-dropbox/">share your content</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Calibre2opds">calibre2opds</a> tool also creates an OPDS catalog from the Calibre metadata database but doesn’t require Calibre to run in order to use the OPDS catalog. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://www.pincette.biz/index.xhtml">Pincette</a> document management system automatically creates an OPDS catalog for the ePub files dropped into a Pincette folder. I hope that more tools for researchers start to support not only ePub but also OPDS. An OPDS interface to the data produced by your favorite piece of lab equipment (gel documentation system, microarray reader, etc.) would be an interesting sight.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Regular readers of this blog know about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/">my current interest in WordPress </a>as a tool to create scholarly content. In the last few weeks I have released several WordPress plugins for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/">reference management</a> and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">create ePub </a>files. Obviously I’m not the only person having this idea. Some interesting projects are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://knowledgeblog.org/">Knowledge Blog</a> – a JISC-funded project for light-weight scientific publishing</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Code4Lib_Journal_WordPress_Input_Guidelines">Code4Lib</a> – a journal that provides practical solutions for technologists working in libraries, using WordPress as publishing platform</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://ptsefton.com/2010/03/30/my-obsession-with-wordpress.htm">My obsession with WordPress</a> – Peter Sefton’s thoughts on WordPress as a scholarly publishing platform</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mendeley-related-research/">Mendeley Related Research</a> – a plugin that finds academic research related to your blog posts</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twxSOGGQV84&amp;feature=player_embedded">Annotem</a> – an open-source journal authoring and publishing platform based on WordPress</li></ul><p>WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, and many science bloggers (including us here at PLoS Blogs) use WordPress. And science bloggers have some specific requirements, e.g. easy to use tools for linking to scholarly papers or aggregators of blog posts about a particular paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging</a>) or science blogging in general (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/">ScienceSeeker</a>). A number of people use WordPress as a lab notebook (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettinger</a>). There is no clear difference between WordPress as a scholarly writing tool and WordPress as a blogging tool, and I expect that the amount of scholarly writing done with WordPress will only increase.</p><p>Two days ago Ed Yong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/02/02/research-into-reprogrammed-stem-cells-an-interactive-timeline/">published an interactive timeline</a> of research into reprogrammed stem cells. John Rennie yesterday cited Ed Yong and this post as a wonderful example of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/02/03/why-ed-yong-is-the-future-of-science-news-and-you-could-be-too/">future of science news</a>. The future of science news depends on many things (not least brilliant writers such as Ed and John), but I think we also need better tools to make science writing fun and exciting.</p><p>In the hope that this will improve WordPress as a science writing platform, Mark Hahnel from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.science3point0.com/">Science 3.0</a> blogging network and me today created the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/wordpress-for-scientists">WordPress for Scientists</a> Google Group. We invite developers who are working on scholarly plugins and themes for WordPress to join this group, but also researchers that need specific WordPress tools (e.g. to hook up their lab equiment to WordPress), and science bloggers that have cool ideas on how to improve WordPress for their needs.</p>]]></content>

One take-home message for me was that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub">ePub is a very interesting</a> document format for scholarly publishing and has several advantages over PDF. The workshop had a wonderful spirit <em><em>to do something</em></em>, and in this spirit I wrote a WordPress plugin that automatically creates ePub files from blog posts. The plugin was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export">released today</a>, and can be installed directly from your WordPress installation. A sample ePub can be downloaded from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2011/01/09/embedding-adobe-illustrator-charts-in-wordpress-using-html5/">this blog post</a>, using the link at the bottom.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920im_/http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5095/5406202716_43d1b632e0.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wordpress as ePub" loading="lazy"><figcaption><em><em>The workshop example paper from PLoS Comp Biol, as seen on the iPad.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>This is version 1.0 of the plugin, and there a still number of small bugs, mainly because ePub is a complex format. A big problem is page breaks, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">widows and orphans</a> can currently only be avoided by workarounds. You can also see in the screenshot that the shortcode wasn’t parsed for the ePub.</p><p>But these are minor issues that can be solved in the coming weeks. More interesting for version 1.1 is the inclusion of attachments (other than images) in the ePub. I have to do some more thinking on how to do this, especially how to handle all the possible mime types.</p><p>I like reading science blogs in ePub format, using either Adobe Digital Editions on the Mac or iBooks on iPad and iPhone. This works particularly well for longer posts, e.g. those lovely posts from my science writer colleagues here on PLoS Blogs. If you have access to WordPress, then this plugin is one of the easiest ways to produce content in ePub format.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today nature.com <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/ipad.html">released</a> their iPad reader application. The app gives users access to<em><em> Nature News</em></em> and abstracts from <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Medicine</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Biotechnology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Physics</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Reviews Microbiology, Nature Reviews Genetics</em></em> and <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em>. Full text access to these journals can be purchased for $69.99 per year (<em><em>Nature</em></em> costs $79.99 per year with free access to full-text articles until February 28).</p><p>The iPad app is in many ways similar to the nature.com iPhone app <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/nature_com_iphone_app_in_pictures/">released last February</a>, but takes advantage of the larger screen. A <em><em>Nature News</em></em> article looks like this on the website:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0038-500x375.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="IMG_0038"></figure><p>… and like this in the nature.com reader:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0037-500x375.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="IMG_0037"></figure><p>Much nicer. The <strong><strong>Add to Connotea</strong></strong> button is interesting. Connotea is a social bookmarking service by nature.com, but less popular than CiteULike and Mendeley. So why is there no choice?</p><p>The home screen lists all sources and articles. Users can search nature.com, PubMed and arXiv, but the latter two sources are hidden behind the <strong><strong>Advanced</strong></strong> button (in the upper right corner).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0039-500x375.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="IMG_0039"></figure><p>The saved searches and bookmarks are stored on nature.com and can be shared with the website and iPhone app. The home screen doesn’t follow iPad conventions – the sources don’t appear in a floating window when holding the iPad vertical. Journals can be added here:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0040-500x375.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="IMG_0040"></figure><p>Journal articles look similar to <em><em>Nature News</em></em>. References open in a popup window:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0042-500x375.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="IMG_0042"></figure><p>Figures open not in a popup, but in a separate window, and they can be resized. It is unfortunately not possible to scroll through the figures of a paper.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0041-500x375.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="IMG_0041"></figure><p>The nature.com reader doesn’t reflow content when you hold the iPad vertically, just shows less white margin on both sides. Author names are not links, and for some content the app switches to web browser mode.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0043-375x500.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="IMG_0043"></figure><p>Reading papers on the iPad is much more fun than on the iPhone. And it was a smart move <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html">to use ePub</a> for these mobile apps instead of PDF, I think that ePub<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/"> has a bright future</a> for scholarly content. This is version 1.0, I’m sure future versions will do further improve the reading experience thanks to HTML5. The prices for a personal subscription sounds reasonable, especially for the weekly <em><em>Nature</em></em>.</p><p>I have one problem with the application: the papers I read are not all published by Nature Publishing Group. I would very much prefer an ePub reader for all journal content, similar to the iPad PDF readers <strong><strong>Sente</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong>. We already have several ePub readers for the iPad (e.g. Stanza and iBooks), but we need more journal publishers that offer their content in this format. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html">press release last February</a> hinted that Nature Publishing Group will provide content in ePub format for other e-readers. Subscription journals such as the <em><em>Nature</em></em> journals have another problem, they want to charge the iPad user for reading content. This makes it more difficult for them than for open access publishers to distribute content in innovative ways, and that is probably one reason the nature.com iPad app is a closed system that can’t import, export or print articles.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having breakfast at the end of a conference is a good way to recap what was discussed and can help to generate new ideas. Two years ago at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://scienceonline09.com/">ScienceOnline09</a> a conversation with Cameron Neylon that followed up on the session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2801/version/1/html">Reputation, authority and incentives. Or: How to get rid of the Impact Factor</a> (moderated by Björn Brembs and Pete Binfield) was started my interest in unique author identifiers for researchers. An <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/nterview_with_geoffrey_bilder/">interview with Geoff Bilder</a> about author identifiers and the CrossRef Contributor ID project followed a month later – still one of my favorite blog posts. I have since become deeply involved with author identifiers and have joined the Board of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) initiative last September.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912im_/http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5010/5376544624_9914bebffa.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Beyond_PDF_group_photo1" loading="lazy"><figcaption><em><em>Beyond the PDF group photo my lesliekwchan, on Flickr</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Wednesday to Friday I attended the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop in San Diego to discuss how we can do better in scholarly publishing. The limitations of the PDF format were just one topic, the main themes were annotation, data, provenance, new models, writing and reviewing and impact. This is my presentation:</p><p>We had two very productive breakout sessions about writing and reading tools, and we agreed that we should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/home/program-draft/notes-from-the-breakout">build something that makes it much easier to describe and distribute our research data</a>. Most people in the group took a very pragmatic approach and want to build simple tools appropriate for small research groups in the next few months. We thought that graduate students would be good early adopters, and we already have three principal investigators willing to test these tools in their labs.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/BTPDFdiagram-500x373.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="BTPDFdiagram"><figcaption><em><em>Our first prototype, as drawn by Peter Murray Rust</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Peter Sefton demonstrated his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://fascinator-demo.com/portal/default/search">Fascinator</a> tool that already has a lot of the required functionality. But it was the breakfast discussion before departing – again with Cameron Neylon, but this time also including Peter Murray Rust, Peter Sefton and Ana Nelson – that helped me to put all my thoughts into place.</p><blockquote>ePub should become the standard document format for authoring, distributing and reading scholarly content.</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.idpf.org/">ePub format</a> uses a collection of files held together in a zip archive. Content is displayed using a combination of XHTML and CSS – not different from web pages – and the ePub can also contain other files. Journal publishers use XML internally, and it is therefore easy to distribute journal articles in ePub format – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">some of them</a> are already doing this routinely. ePub has several advantages over PDF, including:</p><ul><li>ePub can be used for all steps in the creation of a scholarly document, including data collection, authoring, annotating and peer review. There is no need for time-consuming and expensive format conversions. Currently most manuscripts are submitted in Microsoft Word or LateX formats, and then converted first to XML and then to HTML and PDF. Metadata such as author identifiers, digital object identifiers and semantic information can be added early on and don’t get lost in a format conversion.</li><li>ePub makes it easy to include supplementary material, e.g. video and other multimedia content, the datasets used in the publication (particularly the data used for tables and figures), all cited references in BibTeX format, etc.</li><li>ePub is much better suited for reading on mobile devices, as the format allows reflowing of content. Most articles today are printed from the PDF and then read, but this behavior is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/">rapidly changing</a>.</li></ul><p>ePub is relatively new, and not many applications for scientists already support this format. We want lab equipment that stores its data in ePub, lab notebooks that write all files from an experiment into an ePub file, reference managers that store and display papers in ePub format, authoring tools that import all these ePub files and thus make it much easier to write, annotate and submit a manuscript, and journal submission systems that take ePub files. I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/28/wordpress-for-reference-management/">written a lot about WordPress</a> recently and this is of course a platform that would play nicely with ePub. At least two WordPress plugins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/epub">support ePub</a>, and it should be possible to modify them to the requirements of the scholarly paper.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/epub-500x199.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="epub"></figure><p>Almost as important as the document format is the distribution mechanism of these ePub files. We need a system that makes it easy to collaborate on a document, and that includes version control. The simplest solution would of course be centralized and web-based, but I’m not sure that this is a realistic scenario. We talked a lot about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> during the meeting, but a solution using git (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/https://github.com/">github</a>), Amazon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Simple Storage Service</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive">Windows Live SkyDrive</a> or the repository software ePrints or DSpace is also possible. As an ePub document can contain all required documents, the submission of a manuscript to a journal or institutional repository could become as simple as uploading a single file, and all the peer review (including reviewer comments and revisions) could be done with that file. Submissions of datasets to databases such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://datadryad.org/about">Dryad</a> could of course also be done using ePub files. A versioned distribution system should also make it easier to automatically get information about corrections or retractions (e.g. using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.crossref.org/crossmark.html">CrossMark</a> system that will launch in 2011), and to receive regular updates of article-level metrics, including new citations of the article or dataset.</p><p>Several of us attending the meeting will continue the discussion in the coming weeks, and I hope I can convince them of the advantages of ePub. It shouldn’t take us more than a month or two to produce a nice ePub of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000976">sample PLoS Computational Biology article</a> provided for the Beyond the PDF workshop. The next <strong><strong>Science Online London Conference</strong></strong> will be September 2-3 at the British Library. This is a good opportunity to discuss the progress of this project, ideally including reports about new ePub tools for scientists, more journals using ePub for their articles, and practical feedback from the first users.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.org/whatisdc.html">DataCite</a> is an international consortium for data citation. DataCite originally started as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.std-doi.de/front_content.php">project</a> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.tib-hannover.de/">German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB)</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/datacite-screen-225.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="datacite" width="225" height="258"></figure><p>Since 2005 the TIB was providing digital object identifiers (DOIs) to research datasets. In December 2009 research libraries and technical information centres from 6 countries founded the DataCite initiative. In December 2010 DataCite reach an important milestone by registering the 1,000,000th DOI name.</p><p>Many people are familiar with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> which is providing DOIs for research papers. CrossRef is operated by Publishers International Linking Association (PILA), a non-profit organization formed by scholarly publishers in 2000. Think of DataCite as the counterpart that is providing DOIs for research data. And as research data are typically stored in data centers associated with technical information centers  - e.g. the British Library or the  Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI) - and large research libraries (e.g. California Digital Library), DataCite members come from the academic community.</p><p>The TIB is located in Hannover, just a few miles away from Hannover Medical School where I work. In December I sat down with Jan Brase from the TIB, one of the driving forces behind DataCite and on its Board of Directors. We talked not only about DataCite, but also how DataCite could interoperate with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>, the unique author identifier initiative (where I am a member of the Board). One of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.orcid.org/principles">aims</a> of ORCID is to create a <em><em>permanent, clear and unambiguous record of scholarly communication,</em></em> and this of course includes not only publications, but also the contribution of research datasets. Gudmundur Thorisson gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">nice presentation</a> about the possible integration of DataCite and ORCID in September.</p><p>Earlier this week, Jan presented about DataCite at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.ape2011.eu/">Academic Publishing in Europe</a> conference in Berlin. His slides are available on SlideShare, the video of his talk (like all the other presentations) will soon be available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://river-valley.tv/">here</a>.</p><p>Also this week Jan started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.wordpress.com/">DataCite blog</a>. In his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/some-more-details-on-2011/">first post</a> (after the obligatory welcome post) Jan talks about the plans DataCite has for 2011. I am particularly excited about the central metadata repository that should be up and running by June. DataCite has allowed Thomson Reuters to crawl the repository so that the metadata will also appear in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science/">Web of Science</a>. A lot of interesting stuff is going to happen in 2011 around unique identifiers for researchers and their scholarly works.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://scienceonline2011.com/">ScienceOnline2011</a>, the fifth annual international meeting on Science and the Web, is only two days away. I am very excited for many reasons, most importantly because it gives me the chance to meet many online friends in person – again or for the first time.</p><p>On Saturday I will help moderate two (related) sessions: <strong><strong>How is the Web changing the way we identify scientific impact</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Having fun with citations</strong></strong>. The first session will be about alternative ways to measure scientific impact, and about the alternative types of publications we can measure. The second session is all about citations. We use them all the time in scholarly communications, but we don’t really think about them. To give a couple of examples: why are there so many different citation styles, why is it so difficult to find open bibliographic data, how can we describe why we decided to cite something, or how can we cite things that are not publications?</p><p>Since I suggested this session a few months ago, my thinking about citations has changed. Citations should be easy to use, wherever we need them. Even though he have a number of clever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/reference-manager-overview/">reference management tools</a>, the process is still too complicated. What would really help is an easier format for references, and the best format I can think of is the ubiquitous internet link. I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/11/citations-are-links-so-where-is-the-problem/">written about links</a> before, and I have spent the last few weeks to work on WordPress plugins to better handle links for scholarly works. Today I released the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-to-link/">Link to Link</a> plugin:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/screenshot-1-500x432.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="screenshot-1" width="500" height="432"><figcaption><em><em>Some science-related references in my WordPress Links Manager.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>The Link to Link window in the WordPress editor should look familiar to users of traditional reference managers. You search for references and then insert them into the text. The references are stored in the WordPress Links Manager, and you can get them in there using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/">BibTeX Importer</a> plugin I wrote two weeks ago. Both plugins are available from the WordPress plugins directory and can be installed directly from WordPress.</p>]]></content>

For more information see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/rental.html">yesterday’s press release</a>.</p><p>In the discussion of subscriptions vs. author-pays for scholarly papers we sometimes forget that it’s really a question of how much we are willing to pay. I’m looking forward to the nature.com app for the iPad, and $9.99 per month seems reasonable. I would not rent a single article for $3.99 – this should either be $0.99 or give me the PDF that I can download and print, something that subscription journals typically charge $10-$30.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s very unusual for me to post two blog posts in a single day, and even more so when both posts are based on press releases by the same organization. But this is important news for everybody interested in scholarly publishing.</p><p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html">press release</a> earlier today, the Nature Publishing Group announced a new journal that</p><ul><li>is covering biology, chemistry, earth sciences and physics,</li><li>is an open access journal, giving the authors the choice of two Creative Commons non-commercial licenses,</li><li>will publish all papers that are judged to be technically valid and original, and</li><li>uses article-level metrics to put the emphasis on the individual article rather than the journal as a whole.</li></ul><p>The new journal is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html"><em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em></a>, and obviously resembles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.plosone.org/"><em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em></a> in many ways, down to the article-processing charges which are $1350 for both journals (but will go up to $1700 for <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> in 2012). The journal is open for submissions and will publish the first papers this summer. With <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> (also see my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/11/26/nature_communications_interview_with_lesley_anson/">interview</a> with Chief Editor Lesley Anson) and <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> the Nature Publishing Group now publishes three journals covering all areas of the natural sciences.</p><p>The launch of <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> is a good sign that <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> is doing something right. It will be interesting to watch whether the two journals will only be competitive – they are aiming for the same manuscript submissions – or will also collaborate on projects such as article-level metrics.</p><blockquote>“Scholarly communication has always, will always, and should always be served by a mix of models.”</blockquote><p>In another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/statement.html">press release</a> today, David Hoole explains the position of the Nature Publishing Group on open access publishing. He argues that journals such as <em><em>Nature</em></em> with a 90% rejection rates are better served by a subscription model, and that he feels that journal submission fees (as discussed in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">recent report</a>) are not an attractive option. The press release also mentions that 40% of the content of the hybrid journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">Nature Communications</a> is currently open access.</p><p>Although I can follow the arguments made in the press release, I disagree that we need different “tiers” of journals. The <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> FAQ makes it clear that the journal doesn’t expect authors to submit their best works, but rather papers that require “speed of publication”, promise “no conceptual advance in the field” and show “negative results”. Let’s see how authors will respond to this and whether it will be possible 10 years from now to distinguish papers published in <em><em>Nature,</em></em> <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> and <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em>.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/wordpress-for-reference-management"/>
        <updated>2010-12-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the more complicated aspects of scientific writing is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/reference-management/">reference management</a> – an important limitation of online collaborative tools such as <em><em>Google Docs</em></em>. I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/05/blogging-beyond-the-pdf/">argued before</a> that WordPress has the potential to become a great scientific writing tool. Wordpress can’t do reference management out of the box, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=bibtex">available plugins</a> are somewhat limited. But WordPress is a good platform to add reference management functions: it is not only extremely popular (meaning a lot of people have expertise and many tools are available), but also already knows a lot about links, and has a wonderful plugin architecture.</p><h3 id="reference-database">Reference database</h3><p>The first question with reference management in WordPress is where to store the references. Should they not be stored at all and be directly imported from the source (journal website or bibliographic database such as PubMed)? This is what most of us are currently doing when writing blog posts, but this approach has obvious limitations on more ambitious writing projects. Or should references be inserted from an online reference manager such as CiteULike, Mendeley, Refworks or Endnote Web? This is how we use these reference managers with Microsoft Word and similar word processors.</p><p>Instead I prefer a third approach: store the references in the built-in Links Manager in WordPress. References are nothing more than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/11/citations-are-links-so-where-is-the-problem/">specialized links</a> after all. We loose functionality compared to reference manager databases, but we get some very interesting features for free, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broken-link-checker/">automatic checking of broken links</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/blogrollsync/">automatic link synchronization</a> with other WordPress installations, and all the other cool things for links that people have come up with. And this makes it much easier for authors to collaborate if they use different reference managers, as all required references are stored in a common database.</p><h3 id="bibtex-importer">BibTeX Importer</h3><p>There is currently no good solution to important references into the Links Manager, so I wrote a WordPress plugin to do just that. It took me two days, which says less about my skills, but more about the WordPress plugin architecture. Like all plugins hosted at WordPress.org, my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/">BibTeX Importer</a> plugin can be installed directly from within your WordPress installation in less than 5 minutes.</p><p>The plugin takes any BibTeX file (BibTeX is one of the more common file formats for references, all good reference managers can export into that format) and imports it into the WordPress Links Manager. The plugin can also import a BibTex file via URL (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex/user/mfenner">http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex/user/mfenner</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/12/screenshot-2-500x198.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="BibTeX Importer"></figure><p>The plugin creates WordPress links where the link name is in the format<strong><strong> first author – year – title</strong></strong>. The original BibTeX entry is stored in the link notes. The plugin does some extra work, e.g. checks for duplicates before importing and picks the DOI if several URLs are available for the link. The plugin also checks the BibTex entry type (article, PhD thesis, book chapter, etc.) and automatically assigns a link category with that name. The next step would be a solution that automatically synchronizes your WordPress Links Manager with a reference manager.</p><h3 id="inserting-references">Inserting references</h3><p>Once the references are in the Links Manager, we can use them in the articles we write. Unfortunately WordPress doesn’t provide an easy way to do that. I personally like the WordPress TinyMCE editor, so I made some changes to the wonderful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-to-post/">Link to Post</a> plugin. The plugin provides a searchable interface to link to the posts, pages, categories and tags of your own WordPress blog. It took me half a day to add a link section, so now I can search for links and insert them into a post in a way not that different from how we use reference managers with Microsoft Word. The plugin also searches for co-authors, journal names and words in abstracts, as all this information is stored in the Link notes as BibTeX entry. I will make the updated Link to Post plugin available for download (I have contacted the plugin author), for the time being please contact me if you are interested.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/12/link2post-500x377.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="Link to Post"></figure><h3 id="providing-a-bibliography">Providing a bibliography</h3><p>This is the last feature that I need for reference management with WordPress, and that should also be feasible to do. Ideally the bibliography should be created automatically from the links in the text, using the BibTeX info stored in the links database. In fact, this is something that a publisher could also do after manuscript submission, as the required information is all there. The bibliography should use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">Citation Style Language,</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a> (a standard for publishing machine-readable reference information in HTML), and should check for duplicate references, broken links, etc.</p>]]></content>

The video of his presentation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://river-valley.tv/new-and-emerging-technologies-for-reference-software/">has now been made available</a> by River Valley TV, and his slides are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2010_12_03_Innovations_Rollins_Bibliographic_Management_Software.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Jason talks about some recent trends in reference management software. For him one important new trend is APIs/extensions. I fully agree with him, but we haven’t really seen many tools based on these APIs. Reference managers that provide APIs include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://dev.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/api/">Endnote</a>, Refworks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://developer.mekentosj.com/">Papers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/">Zotero</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.connotea.org/wiki/WebAPI">Connotea</a>. The availability of an API has done a lot for the success of Web 2.0 tools such as Twitter and Flickr.</p><p>Another interesting topic was brought up in the discussion: should reference managers track difference versions of an article (e.g. pre-print, post-print, publisher PDF)? According to Jason many Endnote users request this feature. Jason is leading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> development team, but also mentions Mendeley, CiteULike and Papers in his presentation.

        <updated>2010-12-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Citations are a fundamental concept of scholarly works. Unfortunately they are also difficult to do. Traditional writing tools such as Microsoft Word can’t really handle them in a way that is appropriate for a scientific manuscript, and that is why we have reference managers such as Endnote, Zotero or Mendeley. And the lack of this functionality is a major reason that Google Docs and other online collaborative writing tools haven’t become popular for writing scholarly works.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/4363633528_5026a5ce8b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="1958 Edsel Citation" loading="lazy" width="500" height="333"><figcaption><em><em>1958 Edsel Citation by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.flickr.com/photos/roadsidepictures/">Roadsidepictures</a>, on Flickr.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Using citations is hard for paper authors. The process is still complicated when using a reference manager, and it remains one of the more time consuming aspects of writing a manuscript. The main reason is that something always seems to go wrong with the formatting of the bibliography, but there are also issues of wrong or duplicate citations (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57698/">citation mutations</a>), correct citation styles, etc. I can’t comment on how well BibTeX integrates citation management into LaTeX, but the main issue seems to be that citations usually are not one of the core functions of the writing tool.</p><h3 id="wordpress-and-reference-managers">WordPress and reference managers</h3><p>The blogging platform <strong><strong>WordPress</strong></strong> could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/05/blogging-beyond-the-pdf/">become an excellent authoring platform</a> for scientific papers. But to become successful, WordPress has to handle scholarly citations, and not just with copy and paste. Carl Boettinger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/570">has written about doing citations in WordPress</a> ealier this week and there is also an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://friendfeed.com/science-2-0/deef8494/how-do-you-manage-citations-when-writing-on-web">ongoing FriendFeed discussion</a>. I have also looked at the available plugins, in particular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/papercite/">papercite</a> (based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bib2html/">bib2html</a>) which uses the BibTex format and is giving me some problems. I can’t get the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://labs.crossref.org/site/blog_plugins.html">CrossRef Citation plugin</a> to work (SyntaxError: Parse error) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mendeleyplugin/">Mendeley Plugin</a> is displaying bibliographies, rather than inserting citations. There is currently probably no easy solution to cite scholarly works in WordPress and I don’t think that creating a WordPress Plugin for one of the reference managers is the right approach.</p><h3 id="citations-are-links">Citations are links</h3><p>If we think about it, citations are nothing more than specialized links that contain additional information and formatting. And the references section is a list of footnotes. Links are a genuine part of WordPress, and this system should therefore also be used when writing scholarly works with WordPress. A Citation Plugin should extend this system, and solve these issues:</p><ul><li>WordPress isn’t very smart about footnotes. I use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.elvery.net/drzax/wordpress-footnotes-plugin">WP-Footnotes</a> Plugin, but we need additional functionality: avoid duplicates, formatting options of in-text citations (e.g. range of citations or author-year) and sorting of footnotes by occurence or name.</li><li>The tool to create links in articles is not really integrated with the WordPress Links system (in contrast to images, where you have access to the media gallery when inserting an image).</li></ul><p>Both of  these issues can be solved, especially since they are not specific to scholarly works and could be tackled by thousands of WordPress developers out there.</p><p>We don’t want to use WordPress as a reference manager, as there are already many tools out there that can do this job much better. We rather want reference manager integration with WordPress, and the easiest way to do this would be an automatic synchronization with the WordPress Links database. We can already do this with the social bookmarking tool <strong><strong>delicious</strong></strong> (I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-deliciouslinks/">DeliciousLinkSync</a>), so it shouldn’t be difficult to do this with the social bookmarking tools for scientists such as <strong><strong>CiteULike </strong></strong>(you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blog.citeulike.org/?p=174">sync CiteULike with delicious</a>, a workaround I currently use), <strong><strong>Connotea</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>BibSonomy</strong></strong>.</p><h3 id="links-are-powerful">Links are powerful</h3><p>Using the WordPress Links system makes it very easy to extend the core functionality, and many interesting tools are already out there. A good example is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broken-link-checker/">Broken Link Checker</a>. The Plugin can regularly check the links in your blog posts, but could also be used to check DOIs for references in a semi-automated way. The Broken Link Checker found 30 broken links in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2010/12/05/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications-2/">Blogging Beyond the PDF sample article</a> (all my fault), and automatically changed the display style for them.</p><p>And there is so much more that can be done with links. I am particularly interested in adding meaning to links using the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-1480-1-S1-S6">CiTO</a>). And I want to be able to cite specific parts of an article. Dave Winer has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/21/newBloggingTechniques.html">introduced</a> paragraph-level permalinks to blogs, and I can do this on WordPress using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://danielbachhuber.com/2010/10/27/winerlinks-v0-2-released/">WinerLinks Plugin</a>. The broken links in my Blogging Beyond the PDF sample article are all internal links, and I can now use WinerLinks to fix them. An example where I have already done this is the reference to Table S8 in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2010/12/05/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications-2/#p16">this paragraph</a>.</p><p><em><em>Update on 12/11/10: I’ve installed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://ptsefton.com/2010/12/09/beyond-the-pdf-proposed-session-bring-the-web-to-the-researcher-mainly-on-authoring-tools.htm">Anotar Plugin</a> by Peter Sefton that adds paragraph-level commenting.</em></em></p>]]></content>

The report was also discussed by Robert Kiley on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025454/http://ukpmc.blogspot.com/2010/12/submission-fees-viable-business-model.html">UK PubMed Central blog</a> and by Phil Davis on the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025454/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/12/09/open-access-submission-fees/"> Scholarly Kitchen blog</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/2800029836_f351e8c826.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Buck O' Five (Mission 24: Independent)" loading="lazy" width="500" height="375"><figcaption><em><em>Buck O’ Five (Mission 24: Independent) by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025454/http://www.flickr.com/photos/darabidduckie/">darabidduckie</a>, on Flickr</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Submission fees are more common than I thought, particularly in economics and the life sciences. The American Physiological Society journals, <em><em>Cancer Research</em></em>, <em><em>FASEB Journal</em></em>, <em><em>Journal of Clinical Investigation</em></em>, <em><em>Journal of Immunology</em></em> and <em><em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></em> all charge submission fees between $50 and $100, the <em><em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em></em> dropped the $60 submission fee in 2010. Most journals that charge submission fees are society journals.</p><p>The report finds that submission fees would be particularly interesting for Open Access journals with high rejection rates (70% and more), as this would greatly reduce the article-procesing charges for accepted manuscripts. A journal that accepts 10% of submitted papers could use a $150 submission fee to reduce the fee for accepted manuscripts from $2500 to $1150. There wouldn’t really be a price reduction for journals that accept 50% of submitted papers.</p><p>Mark Ware reports that the Open Access publishers he talked to weren’t really interested in starting submission fees for their journals, mainly because of the risks involved in changing their business model. I personally believe that submission fees may be the only option for journals with high rejection rates to become Open Access journals (unless you want to cross-subsidize those journals). I like submission fees because they help to cover the actual costs involved, instead of the costs of handling manuscripts that are ultimately rejected being paid either by journal subscribers or the authors of accepted manuscripts.</p><p>The full 13-page report can be downloaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025454/http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Files/Filer/downloads/Open%20Access/KE_Submission_fees_Short_Report_2010-11-25.pdf">here</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four weeks ago I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">wrote about</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop that is planned for January in San Diego. The goal of the workshop is to identify a set of requirements, and a group of willing participants to develop open source code to accelerate scientific knowledge sharing. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://groups.google.com/group/beyond-the-pdf?pli=1">Google Group</a> for the workshop has already seen a lot of interesting discussions. I have since had more time to think about my contribution and decided to propose the following:</p><p><em><em>Evaluate the blogging software </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>WordPress</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> as a platform to author, review and publish scientific manuscripts. Extend the <strong><strong>WordPress</strong></strong> functionality for authors and citations.</em></em></p><h3 id="blogging-beyond-the-pdf">Blogging Beyond the PDF</h3><p>Wordpress is a very interesting candidate for this because of the following features:</p><ol><li>WordPress is Open Source and can be easily modified and extended by Themes, Plugins, etc.</li><li>WordPress is used by millions of users, a market much larger than the scientific software market. Many requirements for a scientific writing platform are not specific for scientific software.</li><li>WordPress treats article writing as a workflow that includes collaborative writing, version control, and a document status.</li></ol><p>Of course I’m not the first to think about WordPress in this context, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://journal.code4lib.org/">Code4Lib journal</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://knowledgeblog.org/">Knowledge Blog</a> are just two examples. To get started, I installed WordPress and a number of interesting Plugins at a new<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.xartrials.org/"> Blogging Beyond the PDF</a> website. Phil Bourne has kindly provided material from a recent<em><em> PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000976">paper</a> for the workshop. I formatted a first version of this paper using WordPress and the result can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2010/12/05/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications-2/">here</a>. There are a lot of rough edges (several tables and most references are still missing), but to me this looks good enough considering this is the result of maybe 10 hours of the work. In the next six weeks I will continue to work on this example manuscript to get a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the WordPress platform. I also hope to learn more from the experience of others. My first impressions are below.</p><h3 id="authors">Authors</h3><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/co-authors-plus/">Co-Authors Plus</a> Plugin enables multiple authors per article. Each author can be linked to an author page for displaying biographical info. WordPress could be extended to include additional info such as institution or past publications. Linking the WordPress user account to the unique author identifier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>, and describing the role of the author in the paper (e.g. <em><em>conceived and designed the experiments</em></em> or <em><em>analyzed the data</em></em>) would be particularly interesting. Plugins such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.editflow.org/">Edit Flow</a> can extend the workflow by adding custom status messages (e.g. <em><em>resubmission</em></em>), reviewer comments, and email notifications.</p><h3 id="figures">Figures</h3><p>Wordpress has good functionality to add figures to articles, including the option to add a caption or resize the figure. In addition, there is a good number of Plugins that help with the resizing, other manipulations and display of images.</p><h3 id="tables">Tables</h3><p>Wordpress doesn’t do tables, but several Plugins add that functionality, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-english/">WP-Table Reloaded</a>. This Plugin adds some very interesting functions, including the option to export table data as CSV or XLS files. This makes it much easier to reuse these data, something that I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/30/why-cant-i-reuse-these-tables-and-figures/">find very useful</a>.</p><h3 id="citations">Citations</h3><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.elvery.net/drzax/wordpress-footnotes-plugin">WP-Footnotes</a> Plugin is one of several plugins that adds footnotes to articles. Several Plugins integrate with reference managers such as CiteULike, but the functionality is still very limited compared to how most reference managers are integrated with Microsoft Word or LaTeX.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2010-11-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday I went to see the exhibition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032112/http://www.bl.uk/evolvingenglish/">Evolving English</a> at the British Library in London. The exhibition explores the English language in all its diversity and was recommended to me by Matt Brown, expert on all things London (his review for the Londonist is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032112/http://londonist.com/2010/11/review_evolving_english_british_lib.php">here</a>). <strong><strong>Evolving English</strong></strong> is interesting in many different ways, but here I want to focus on English as the language of science – used in two examples in the exhibition.</p><p>The book <em><em>Micrographia</em></em> from 1665 by Robert Hooke is the first major scientific work devoted to exploration using the microscope. It is also an important step in the development of scientific English. The book was praised for the clarity of the language at the time, but from today’s science writing perspective contains sentences that are too long and convoluted, uses conversational English, and frequently the active voice. The National Library of Medicine provides a beautiful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032112/http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/hooke/hooke.html">online version</a> of the book, where observation XXV starts with:</p><blockquote><em><em>A nettle is a plant so well known to every one, as to what the appearance of it is to the naked eye, that it needs no description; and there are very few that have not felt as well as seen it; and therefore it will be no news to tell that a gentle and slight touch of the skin by a nettle, does oftentime, not onely create very sensible and acute pain, much like that of a burn or scald, but often also very angry and hard swellings and inflammations of the parts, such as will presently rise and continue swoln divers hours.</em></em></blockquote><p>As an example of current scientific English, the exhibitors picked the paper describing the cloning of Dolly (Wilmut 1997). The text is described in the exhibition as:</p><blockquote><em><em>The language is punctual throughout and technical terms are mostly used without explanation. The main text is supported by illustrations (here called figures), tables of data and – over the page – bibliographic references to other scientific research. The purpose is to to maximize accuracy, remove any chance of ambiguity and provide writers with every opportunity to give detailed evidence.</em></em></blockquote><p>The exhibition makes it very clear that the English language is constantly evolving, and scientific English is no exception. Papers written in 10, 20 or 100 years might use a very different language. One important influence today is of course science writing in blogs and other social media. And with electronic publishing, open access, citizen science and other trends, scientific papers have become available to a much larger audience.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Wilmut I, Schnieke AE, McWhir J, Kind AJ, Campbell KH.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) initiative is working on a unique researcher identifier for the creation of a clear and unambiguous scholarly record. The initiative is supported by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/directory">more than 140</a> universities, research institutes, funding organizations, publishers and other organizations interested in scholarly communication. The ORCID system will become publicly available in the first half of 2011.</p><p>Individual researchers will benefit from a unique researcher identifier because this identifier facilitates the manuscript submission process, and the creation of CVs and publication lists for institutional websites. Unique researcher identifiers will also help discover scholarly works and will make it easier to attribute scientific contributions other than papers –  e.g. research datasets – to individual researchers.</p><p>Researchers have a lot to gain from unique researcher identifiers, and they might also have genuine concerns. Because of my interest in scholarly communication, and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps"> unique researcher identifiers in particular</a>, I became involved with the ORCID initiative in early 2010. When ORCID became a non-profit organization in August, I was asked to sit on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/board-directors">Board of Directors</a> – one of many interesting things that have happened to me as the result of my science blogging. But although ORCID is certainly open to all individuals and organizations interested in author disambiguation, most researchers simply want to be informed about the progress of the initiative, ask specific questions and start using their identifier at some point.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID website</a> is a good starting for this information, but to get individual answers to specific researcher questions about ORCID, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/kristiholmes">Kristi Holmes</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/gthorisson">Gudmundur Thorisson</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/CameronNeylon">Cameron Neylon</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/mfenner">myself</a> today started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://groups.google.com/group/orcid-researchers">ORCID Researchers</a> Google Group.

        <updated>2010-10-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My post last week about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/18/new-in-plos-one-citation-rates-of-self-selected-vs-mandated-open-access/">citation rates of mandated vs. self-selected Open Access</a> resulted in an interesting discussion thanks to some good arguments made by Stevan Harnad. One personal conclusion for me: mandates for self-archiving are not a good idea. I would very much prefer researchers to be highly motivated to self-archive thanks to a repository that is both fulfilling important functions and is fun to use.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/17th/4088667379_880b0a796a.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="from Repository Handshake working group on Deposit Use Cases" loading="lazy" width="452" height="500"><figcaption><em><em>Flickr image by diff.jisc (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.flickr.com/photos/dff-jisc/4088667379/">more info</a>).</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>What follows is a short list of ideas – many of them obvious and some of them already implemented – that for me would make repositories more attractive to use.</p><h3 id="hosting-of-research-datasets">Hosting of research datasets</h3><p>Disciplinary and institutional repositories are good places to make primary research data publicly available. Particularly if no standard database exists, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a> for genetic sequence data. Whereas everybody nowadays talks about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/~/link.aspx?_id=28A2778937C74EB285F05E38BFBD5DEE&amp;_z=z">making research data available</a>, the threshold to do so is often too high for more specialized datasets. An institutional repository is a good place for simple grassroots solution.</p><h3 id="a-disciplinary-repository-for-biomedical-research">A disciplinary repository for biomedical research</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK PubMed Central</a> are very popular disciplinary repositories for the biomedical and life sciences. Unfortunately I can only submit manuscripts to them if the research was funded by one of a few funders (including the NIH, but none of the major German funders).</p><h3 id="a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials">A preprint archive for clinical trials</h3><p>Deposition of manuscripts prior to peer review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/09/new-on-arxiv-first-report-of-soap-open-access-publishing-project/">has a long tradition</a> in high-energy physics and related disciplines. Preprint archives probably don’t work in all disciplines, but I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">argued before</a> that they could be a very good idea for clinical trials.</p><h3 id="journal-publishers-that-allow-self-archiving">Journal publishers that allow self-archiving</h3><p>While most publishers allow some form of self-archiving by authors (pre-print, post-print and/or publisher’s PDF version), there are unfortunately still exceptions. The American Chemical Society (ACS) has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://scientopia.org/blogs/bookoftrogool/2010/10/05/acs-the-perfect-storm/">particularly unwelcoming policy</a>.</p><h3 id="integration-with-the-journal-submission-process">Integration with the journal submission process</h3><p>An institutional repository can host pre-prints of submitted papers. But the repository could also enable a tighter integration with the journal submission process. The German <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/https://www.escidoc.org/JSPWiki/en/Overview">eSciDoc</a> project uses that approach. Most researchers would probably welcome technical and financial assistance in the submission process.</p><h3 id="integration-with-institutional-bibliography">Integration with institutional bibliography</h3><p>The institutional bibliography showcases the scholarly work done by a particular researcher, research group, department or institution. Many researchers like to see up-to-date profiles (including publication lists) on their institutional webpages. Bibliographies are also collected for evaluation purposes. We have started to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.bibapp.org/">BibApp</a> at our institution. Repositories can facilitate full-text access to PhD theses and other publications in the bibliography.</p><h3 id="repositories-that-use-unique-author-identifiers">Repositories that use unique author identifiers</h3><p>Regular readers of this blog know about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">my involvement</a> in the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative. All scholarly contributions, including repository content, should be unambiguously connected to their creators as this will greatly facilitate the discovery process. I look forward to ORCID support in repository software such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.eprints.org/">EPrints</a>.</p>]]></content>

Overall the study examined the citations of 27,197 papers from 1,984 non-OA journals. The study also looked at the influence of other factors that affect citation rates, e.g. article age, journal impact factor or number of references.</p><p>The main results of the study are that OA articles are cited more frequently than non-OA articles and that there is no difference in citation rates between mandated and self-archived articles. The authors conclude that OA articles are cited more often not because of self-selection (articles with higher impact more likely become OA), but because of readers cite OA articles more often.</p><p>The study is an effort to better understand if and why OA papers are cited more often, the so-called OA Advantage. Unfortunately I feel that the paper comes a little short. Yes, they did a very detailed analysis of the citation behavior, and take into account important cofactors. But the reader is left with the impression that mandatory self-archiving of post-prints in institutional repositories is the only reasonable Open Access strategy, and the introduction and discussion accordingly leave out some important arguments.</p><p>The authors fail to mention that not all studies show a citation advantage for OA articles (e.g. the randomized controlled trial by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.a568">Davis PM et al. 2008</a>), and they only look at self-archiving in institutional repositories (green OA). Not only are there important disclipline-specific repositories such as PubMed Central and ArXiv, but of course also OA journals such as <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> that published the study (gold OA). And the study only discussed archiving of articles after peer review, even though archiving of preprints is a popular strategy in high-energy physics and related disciplines (and here the self-archiving rate is close to 100%). I also don’t see a discussion of why the self-archiving rate of post-prints in institutions with a mandate is 60% and not close to 100%. And what is wrong if archiving rates are only around 15% if it is left to the researchers to decide? Finally, there are many reasons other than citation rates that make OA worthwhile, including access to the literature for those not working in academic institutions (and maybe never citing a paper), and work that uses the OA literature in new and exciting ways that go beyond citations. For me personally, the OA advantage is much more in these two aspects than in the citation rates of papers.</p><p>For me Open Access week is an opportunity to celebrate what has been achieved over the years. But it is equally important to look at the road ahead. There is no “one size fits all” solution for Open Access, and we shouldn’t look away from the things that aren’t working, and the solutions that haven’t been found yet.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Gargouri, Y., Hajjem, C., Larivière, V., Gingras, Y., Carr, L., Brody, T., &amp; Harnad, S.

        <updated>2010-10-16T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> preprint archive for research articles in physics, mathematics, computer science and related disciplines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/blurb/pg02pr.html">was initiated</a> by Paul Ginsparg in 1991. ArXiv enables the rapid dissemination of research articles prior to peer review, and it quickly became very successful in this. ArXiv has not made the peer-reviewed journal obsolete, but rather provides a service that traditional journals – and that also includes Open Access journals – can’t provide. By 1998, more than 90% of all peer-reviewed papers published in high-energy physics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418">first appeared on ArXiv</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a> was started in 2007 to provide similar services for research in biology, medicine (except clinical trials), chemistry and earth sciences. In addition, many preprints are also hosted in institutional repositories.</p><p>The research that I am doing is clinical research, trying to improve the treatment of patients with cancer. Most clinical trials are drug trials, but there are also surgical interventions, trials with medical devices, etc. Clinical trials are a special kind of research, and I have talked about some aspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances-and-problems-of-doing-science-online">in a previous post</a>. Registration of clinical trials before the first patient is treated – providing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/trds/en/index.html">key information</a> from the trial protocol – is now required in many countries, including the United States and the European Union. The U.S. database of registered clinical trials (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>) is publicly available, and the EU is working on doing the same with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/">EudraCT</a> database. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), and in consequence many medical journals, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.icmje.org/publishing_10register.html">requires clinical trial registration</a>. Since September 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">requires</a> all clinical trials registered at Clinicaltrials.gov to provide key results within 12 months after the last patient has finished treatment.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/4861245046_54d92ddfa9.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="From Basic Discoveries to Patient Treatment" loading="lazy" width="346" height="500"><figcaption><em><em>Flickr image by myelinrepairfoundation.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>The results of clinical trials are rarely first reported in a peer-reviewed journal, but rather are usually first presented at a conference – in the case of important practice-changing clinical trials often before an audience of thousands of people. The conference abstracts are also an important source of information, even though they don’t provide the space for more detailed information, including tables and figures. Many societies publish conference abstract in their society journals, but bibliographic databases such as PubMed probably don’t cover all conference abstracts reporting clinical trial results.</p><p>The peer-reviewed paper is usually published months or even years after the conference presentation. This not only allows for more mature data – e.g. survival information – but also critical review and discussion of the data. The publication of the peer-reviewed paper is <strong><strong>not</strong></strong> the first time the medical community learns about the results of a clinical trial, or draws conclusions for their own research or clinical practice. To take a recent example from a clinical trial in cancer: the results of the TROPIC trial of cabazitaxel chemotherapy in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer (Clinicaltrials.gov <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00417079">NCT00417079</a>) were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=73&amp;abstractID=30560">first reported</a> at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium March 5 (and there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://en.sanofi-aventis.com/binaries/20100304_Asco_GU_en_tcm28-27547.pdf">press release</a> a day earlier). Capazitaxel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm216214.htm">was approved</a> by the FDA on June 17, and I treated the first patient with the drug in September. The peer-reviewed paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61389-X">was published</a> in <em><em>The Lancet</em></em> October 2.</p><p>I would like to suggest that we need a preprint archive for clinical trial research papers. The preprints should be uploaded at the time of journal submission, or shortly after the conference presentation. The preprint server should add some structure to the preprints, e.g. linking to both the clinical trials registry (Clinicaltrials.gov, EudraCT, and others) and the published paper. The preprint should fulfill the requirement for reporting results set by the FDA. Articles in the preprint archive should be freely available, and should ideally provide the main results as downloadable datasets. The preprint server will only work if medical journals – and ideally the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.icmje.org/">ICMJE</a> – have a clear policy allowing prior publication as preprint.</p><p><em><em>This post was inspired by discussions with Salvatore Mele and Ivan Oransky.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last few weeks I haven’t seen any announcement for a new science blogging network (the last one was probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blog.coturnix.org/2010/09/15/alert-some-big-and-important-and-exciting-news/">Scientific American</a> in September). So I thought today would be a good day to start a new one. Earlier today I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blogs.mh-hannover.de/tumorzentrum/2010/10/15/herzlich-willkommen/">the first post</a> on the first blog hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://www.mh-hannover.de/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1">my institution</a>. The blog runs on a WordPress 3.0 installation that I hope will see more blogs in the future – our library will probably be next (they are currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://mhhbibliothek.wordpress.com/">hosted on WordPress.com</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/5001818922_f30d953f07.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Social network in a course" loading="lazy" width="500" height="333"><figcaption><em><em>Flickr image by hanspoldoja.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>The new blog is the official blog of our Comprehensive Cancer Center (my day job). I will write about various aspects of the work there – something I wanted to do for a while. This is also the first time that I write in German, which will be much easier, but at the same time will reach a smaller audience. Writing for my institution will also be an interesting experience. Although I don’t think that this will start something big at our institution, institutions are in fact a good place for blogging networks. Special thanks go to Stefan Zorn in our PR department for encouraging words, and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/about-the-authors/">Henry Scowcroft</a> from Cancer Research UK for many good tips about blogging for an institution.</p><p>The new blog of course doesn’t mean that I stop writing here. I’m too deep into this.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204928/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/08/nature-com-iphone-app-in-pictures">wrote about</a> the Nature.com iPhone application that was released in February. Two weeks ago the app was updated with the following changes:</p><ul><li>Access to abstracts from additional journals: <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Medicine</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Biotechnology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Reviews Microbiology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Reviews Genetics, Nature Physics</em></em> and <em><em>Nature Communications.</em></em></li><li><em><em>Access to fulltext articles for a monthly subscription fee ($9.99 for Nature, $8.99 for the other journals). Access to Nature News and Nature Communications is free.</em></em></li></ul><p>The updated app doesn’t work with the iPad, and the Android version that was announced in February has not been released yet. Users that don’t update to the newest version of the app don’t get access to additional journals, but can still read full-text articles from Nature.</p><p>Reading papers on the iPad for me is a lot of fun. The reading experience on the iPhone/iPod touch is very different, and not something I would spend $9.99 a month for. But it is obvious where this is heading: many users (including myself) would probably spend $9.99/month for a nicely done iPad version of Nature. Especially if content is free/cheaper with an institutional subscription. And we can already read PLoS content for free with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204928/http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2010/09/16/plos-reader-2-0/">PLoS Reader</a>.</p>]]></content>

There are also at least two related session proposals: <strong>How is the Web changing the way we identify scientific impact?</strong> (Jason Priem, Paul Groth)<strong><strong> </strong></strong>and <strong><strong>The Digital Toolbox: What’s Needed? </strong></strong>(Kaitlin Thaney) – we might combine some of our ideas.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PDF has become the standard way we consume scientific papers, but in fact is not a good format for this purpose at all. Or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.mjrobbins.net/">Martin Robbins</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.nature.com/franknorman/2010/09/10/my-science-online-london-2010-impressions">said at the recent Science Online London conference</a>: <em><em>PDF is an insult to science</em></em>. The problem was nicely illustrated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/">Duncan Hull</a>, using a quote from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/">Peter Murray-Rust</a> from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1069">May 2008</a> article:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/18th/3367901850_5b137da197.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Metadata or Meatdata? The PDF &quot;hamburger&quot;..." loading="lazy" width="500" height="375"><figcaption><em><em>Flickr image by dullhunk. From his <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/dullhunk/defrosting-the-digital-library-a-survey-of-bibliographic-tools-for-the-next-generation-web">Defrosting the Digital Library</a> slideshow.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>There are of course ways journal publishers can add metadata to PDF files, e.g. using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/">XMP</a> markup. But that is only a workaround – what we really want is journal papers in a format that is all about document structure and not about looking good in print. XML is obviously that format with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM-DTD</a> as the de facto standard for scholarly publications. Many journal publishers use that format internally, as does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> for displaying fulltext papers, as well as archiving projects such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/">Portico</a>.</p><p>But there are two problems with how NLM-DTD is used now. The first problem is that most scientific papers still are ultimately read as printouts of PDF files, even though most journals now are online only. I wrote in January that this reading behavior is starting to change (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/">How do you read papers? 2010 will be different</a>), and new article formats – such as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/26/how_does_the_article_of_the_future_look_like/">Article of the Future</a> by Cell Press – and the success of the iPad are two major reasons for that.</p><p>The second problem is that there are no good NLM-DTD tools for authors. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/lemon8_xml_interview_with_mj_suhonos/">Lemon8-XML</a> and the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/">Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-In</a> are two examples that I have written about before. Publishers spend a significant amount of time and money (and using tools such as <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/extyles_interview_with_elizabeth_blake_and_bruce_rosenblum/">eXtyles</a>) to convert submitted manuscripts from Microsoft Word, Open Office or LaTeX formats into NLM-DTD. I wrote about my <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/my_paper_writing_dream_machine_1_0/">paper writing dream machine</a> that would use the NLM-DTD more than two years ago. I still believe that the ideal authoring tool should be web-based, but in 2010 this should be done in HTML5 and not Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight.</p><p>The two problems are obviously related. When more people are reading papers in other formats than PDF and see the advantages, it changes the idea of a scientific paper that most people have from a static document do a document that is enriched with primary research data, visualizations that use 3D and video, links to related resources, the possibility to comment, and has more than one document version. In other words, what HTML and the WWW <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">were invented for</a> by Tim Berners-Lee when working at CERN. At this point the incentives to create better authoring tools will be much greater, and the second problem should solve itself. And HTML and related technologies have now evolved to the point where they allow the building of some very attractive authoring tools.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.sdsc.edu/~bourne/">Phil Bourne</a> has written and talked a lot about this problem, including a recent editorial in <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000787">What do I want from the publisher of the future?</a>) and a related <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.scivee.tv/node/18299">SciVee video</a>. He has also been working very hard to organize the <strong><strong>Beyond the PDF</strong></strong> workshop, to be held in San Diego January 19-21. The workshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">website</a> went live last week and is a very good source of information. The goal of the workshop is to identify a set of requirements and to start developing open source code that accelerates moving beyond PDF for scientific papers.</p><p>I will of course do everything possible to attend this workshop, but haven’t yet secured funding for the trip. What I hope to contribute to the <strong><strong>Beyond the PDF</strong></strong> project is a more intelligent use of citations (the following was also posted to the Beyond the PDF <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://groups.google.com/group/beyond-the-pdf">discussion group</a>):</p><h3 id="unique-author-identifiers">Unique Author Identifiers</h3><p>Unique author identifiers such as <a href="https://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> not only are a big help in knowledge discovery (finding other interesting papers, datasets, etc. by the same person), but they can also help to better define the contributions of a researcher to a particular paper. This could mean a general description of the contribution (had idea for project, collected data, helped write manuscript, etc.), or could also describe a very specific contribution (researcher X did experiment Y).</p><h3 id="citation-styles">Citation styles</h3><p>We already have far too many citation styles, but the styles we use<br>have several important shortcomings. I suggest the following changes:</p><ul><li>Use the <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> instead of volume and page numbers whenever possible</li><li>Use <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> to link to the authors of the citations</li><li>Use the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2009/03/citation_typing_ontology.html">CiTO</a>) to describe the meaning of the citation</li><li>Use a note field to explain why the citation was used</li></ul><p>Any authoring tool should obviously use the Citation Style Language (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">CSL</a>) to format citations. And the citations should be provided with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC Zero</a> or similar license to allow reuse.</p><h3 id="cited-by">Cited by</h3><p>At least as important as the citations by a particular paper are the incoming citations, the works that cite a paper. We need much better mechanisms to automate these “trackbacks”, and this should go beyond other papers and also include datasets, blog posts, etc. The incoming citations are of course very helpful for discovery, and the basis for <a href="https://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">alternative metrics</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The iPad was released six months ago, and we already have several reference managers available for the platform. Reading the PDF of a scientific paper on an iPad is a positive experience, and to me very different from reading the PDF on a regular computer. While this could also be done with generic iPad PDF readers such as <strong><strong>iBooks</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>Goodreader</strong></strong>, reference managers make it much easier to organize a large collection of PDF files.</p><h3 id="citeulike">CiteULike</h3><p>CiteULike is a browser-based reference manager and works on the iPad as expected – and this includes the bookmarklet. CiteULike is a good tool to collect references when browsing with the iPad. CiteULike doesn’t allow offline reading of PDF files. While you can read the HTML versions of papers with the iPad web browser, this requires not only online access, but often also access through a paywall.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://www.citeulike.org/">More Info</a></p><h3 id="papers-for-ipad">Papers for iPad</h3><p>This was the first reference manager specifically designed for the iPad. Papers for Mac owners can synchronize all their references and fulltext PDF files. The functionality is similar to the Mac version and also includes a good PDF reader and searching for references in PubMed and other online databases. This makes Papers a good stand-alone solution that doesn’t depend on syncing to another applications.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://mekentosj.com/papers/ipad/">More Info</a> – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://itunes.apple.com/app/papers/id304655618?mt=8">iTunes</a></p><h3 id="mendeley-lite">Mendeley Lite</h3><p>Mendeley Lite syncs with all references you store in your Mendeley web account. I personally prefer this approach as I don’t particularly like syncing between iPad and desktop computer. Just like Papers, this application works both on iPad and iPhone. You can’t directly add references to Mendeley Lite. Mendeley is currently the only application that has both a web-based and an iPad version. This increases the options, but probably also adds to user confusion. Add reference with the web-based version, sync, then read PDF in Mendeley Lite?<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/mendeley-reference-manager/id380669300?mt=8">iTunes</a></p><h3 id="sente-viewer-for-ipad">Sente Viewer for iPad</h3><p>Last Friday <strong><strong>Sente Viewer for iPad</strong></strong> was released. Similar to Papers and Mendeley, Sente Viewer for iPad synchronizes with the desktop version of the application. The application allows browsing of all synchronized references and reading of the associated fulltext PDF papers. The <strong><strong>Sente for iPad</strong></strong> application will be released later and will also allow adding and editing of references. I’m looking forward to “targeted browsing” which will capture both reference information and fulltext PDF files using a built-in web browser – another variation of reference manager integration with the web browser.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/site/iPadSente.html">More Info</a> – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sente-viewer/id392355663?mt=8">iTunes</a></p><h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3><p>Roderic Page has done <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2010/09/viewing-scientific-articles-on-ipad.html">a lot of writing</a> about reading scientific papers on the iPad, including reviews for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2010/08/viewing-scientific-articles-on-ipad_31.html">Papers for iPad</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2010/08/viewing-scientific-articles-on-ipad_3052.html">Mendeley Lite</a>. Wizfolio is another web-based reference manager that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://blog.wizfolio.com/index.php/2010/07/2-thumb-power-surfing-on-the-ipad/">works on the iPad</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.academicproductivity.com/2010/readermeter-crowdsourcing-research-impact/">blog post last week</a>, Dario Taraborelli officially announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://readermeter.org/">ReaderMeter</a>. ReaderMeter takes the usage data from reference managers (starting with <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>) to analyze the impact of publications by a particular author.</p><p>ReaderMeter is a welcome addition to other metrics of researcher impact, most of which are citation-based. And ReaderMeter was hacked together in a few nights, so the service should improve over time. Dario mentions some of the current limitations in his blog post:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Usage data only from Mendeley</strong></strong>. We don’t know whether the reading patterns of users from other reference managers (e.g. CiteULike, Zotero, Endnote Web and Refworks) differ. Dario is working on adding more services.</li><li><strong><strong>Author disambiguation</strong></strong>. This is a critical component, and the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">ORCID</a> initiative is probably the best tool to overcome this limitation, especially when data from several reference managers have to be integrated.</li><li><strong><strong>Article disambiguation</strong></strong>. Multiple copies of the same reference are common in reference manager databases. The <a href="https://doi.org/">DOI</a> can solve this problem for those publications that have a DOI, but consequent use of the DOI by journals, citation databases and reference managers has yet to become standard practice.</li></ul><p>ReaderMeter is visually pleasing and fun to use. And the data are also provided in JSON format, which allows integration into other web pages, e.g. the researcher’s home page.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2010-09-30T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tables and figures contain the data of a scientific paper in condensed (and often visually appealing) form. This is why they are among the first thing we look at, and why they are often reused when we discuss the paper in a presentation or blog post.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/ppat.v06.i08.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="PLoS Pathogens" width="251" height="251"><figcaption><em><em>From </em>https://doi.org/<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001042">10.1371/journal.ppat.1001042</a>. Image credit: Thomas J. Hannan, Washington University.</em></em></figcaption></figure><p>Electronic publication has dramatically simplified the reuse of tables and figures, and therefore reuse has become very common – you probably find reused material in most presentations given in academic institutions or at conferences.</p><p>Most authors will probably be happy that their results are disseminated, and reuse is likely to lead to more people reading the full paper and citing the work.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/bmccancer-e1285879074865.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="bmccancer" width="500" height="450"><figcaption>From https://doi.org/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-10-286">10.1186/1471-2407-10-286</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>But this reuse has two problems. The first problem is copyright. Many journals own the copyright of the papers they publish and don’t allow reuse without prior permission. Unfortunately copyright is a complicated issue, and also differs between countries. Most researchers assume “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">Fair use</a>“ when they reuse material, but this might not apply to all situations, e.g. presentations at conferences. And many researchers don’t understand that they have often given away the copyright to their own works, so that they can’t show a figure from one of their papers without permission.</p><p>Many publishers have automated the process of obtaining permissions for copyrighted work, e.g. using the <a href="http://www.copyright.com/viewPage.do?pageCode=pu4-n">Rightslink</a> system of the Copyright Clearance Center. But it still requires a considerable investment in time (and often money) to obtain all permissions, especially since these are usually one-time permissions only. This combination of unawareness of the details of copyright law and the required extra work means that many researchers probably don’t obtain permissions prior to reuse.</p><p>The solution to the copyright problems is obviously to use material with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license whenever possible, as I have done in this blog post. And most Open Access papers are published under this license, so there is plenty of material to choose from.</p><p>But there is also a second problem with reusing tables and figures. They were designed to be part of a paper and often look terrible in a presentation, particularly tables.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/plosone-e1285879245843.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" title="plosone" width="500" height="402"><figcaption><em><em>From </em>https://doi.org/</em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022"><em><em>10.1371/journal.pone.0006022</em></em></a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The solution to this problem is to provide the data behind the table or figure, so that the information can be displayed in a way that makes sense in a presentation. Here we usually have to reduce the amount of information, but it could also mean that we remix the content with other sources. The Creative Commons licenses discussed above are<a href="http://pantonprinciples.org/"> not appropriate</a> for data. Whenever possible, scientific data should be placed in the public domain.</p><p>It is important to distinguish the publication of table and figure data from the publication of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/bmc_research_notes_wants_your">whole research dataset</a>. The open questions with the latter (e.g. standard data formats, appropriate repositories, archiving) don’t apply to the former. This means that publishers could start providing these data immediately. I’m confident that they would see an increase in paper downloads and citations. But more importantly I hope this would lead to better presentations in seminars and at conferences.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Christian Specht,</p><p>Thank you very much for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57698/">your detailed response</a> in <em><em>The Scientist</em></em> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/20/letter-to-the-scientist/">our previous letter</a> regarding citation mutations. You clarified several issues that were raised in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57689/">your original study</a>, particularly that citation mutation rates have dropped significantly in the last 10 years (probably due to the more widespread use of reference management software), and that some citation mutations (e.g. 680→685 in Laemmli 1970) might be introduced not by citing authors, but by the citation database.</p><p>You rightfully point out that citation mutations indicate a much bigger problem: <em><em>authors often do not read the publications cited in their work</em></em>. I am not aware of any available direct data, but in an ongoing study Richard Grant is looking at this question (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://blog.the-scientist.com/2010/09/23/mutatis-citandi/">Do you read the papers you cite?</a>). The preliminary data that Richard kindly made available indicate that more than 85% of authors indeed read the papers they cite.</p><p>In another study made aware to us by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://twitter.com/noahWG/status/25410352261">Noah Gray</a>, Neale et al. (Neale 2009) used an elegant experimental design to address the same question. They studied lethal acquired mutations – retracted papers that in theory should no longer be cited – as an estimate of how diligent authors were reading the papers they cite.</p><p>The authors compared the number of citations of 102 retracted papers (starting 12 months after the retraction) to a control group of papers and found no difference in the average number of citations (26 vs. 27). Content analysis of a subset of citing papers indicated that more than 50% of citations used the retracted paper to support their own findings and less than 5% of citing papers mentioned the retraction.</p><p>These findings not only seem to contradict the preliminary findings by Richard Grant, but also indicate that journal publishers and citation databases may not be properly communicating paper retractions.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p><strong><strong>Laemmli UK</strong></strong>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Citation styles are one of the greater mysteries for the novice manuscript writer. There are numerous ways that authors, title, journal, etc. can be arranged and formatted (see examples below), and in bibliographies citations can be ordered either alphabetically or by order of appearance in the text.</p><p><strong><strong>Laemmli UK</strong></strong>. Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4. <em><em>Nature</em></em>. 1970;227:680-685.</p><p><strong><strong>U. K. Laemmli</strong></strong> (1970). ‘Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4′. <em><em>Nature</em></em> <strong><strong>227</strong></strong>(5259):680-685.</p><p><strong><strong>U. K. Laemmli</strong></strong>, <em><em>Nature </em></em><strong><strong>227</strong></strong>, 680 (1970).</p><p>Because of this complexity, it has long become impractical to format citations manually, and formatting of citations and bibliographies is one of the main reasons for using reference management software. I interviewed Rintze Zelle (scientist and open source contributor) and Ian Mulvany (vice president of new product development at Mendeley) to better understand citation styles in general and the open source Citation Style Language (CSL) in particular. CSL co-developers Bruce D’Arcus and Frank Bennett provided important feedback.</p><h3 id="1-what-is-the-citation-style-language"><strong><strong>1. What is the Citation Style Language?</strong></strong></h3><p>Rintze Zelle: Scientific literature depends heavily on proper referencing. However, when writing a manuscript, manually editing citations and bibliographies is time consuming and error prone. Citation styles also differ between scientific journals, so authors often have to switch citation styles when they submit their manuscript to a different journal than originally anticipated.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a> (CSL) is an open XML based language meant to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies. When provided with the metadata (title, year, authors, etc.) of the cited items (journal articles, books, etc.), and a CSL style, a CSL processor can automatically generate the bibliography and in-text citations. CSL is currently used by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, and both programs offer word processor plug-ins for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/">Microsoft Word</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>. Several other projects are working on or exploring CSL support.</p><h3 id="2-do-we-really-need-hundreds-of-citation-styles">2. Do we really need hundreds of citation styles?</h3><p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: We have asked ourselves this question many times over. Some variability is certainly warranted: numeric, author-date and footnote styles are very different, and each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, small variations in citation styles result in a situation where almost every journal or publisher has its unique style. We think that even with the use of automated tools like CSL, reducing the number of citation styles in use could result in significant cost and time savings in scientific publishing. But this is a problem beyond the scope of CSL, so our goal is simply to support all the variability that currently exists in citation styles.</p><p><strong><strong>Ian Mulvany</strong></strong>: After working for many years at Springer, and then Nature, I was well aware that most large publishers just push submitted manuscripts out to companies in India where the formatting of the paper happens. The input format and citation formatting really doesn’t matter to most publishers. They just tear the submitted manuscript to pieces and rebuild it in their chosen XML schema.</p><p>However, most people using citations are not actually submitting manuscripts for publication, but rather are writing term papers, or theses, or reports. So the weird thing is that citations started off as a required identifier for the literature. Google Scholar and HTTP URIs such as the DOI have almost totally made formatted citations redundant as identifiers, and yet there is still a huge user need to be able to format citations according to a huge variety of styles, and since that need is going to continue for quite a long time, it’s a need that we have to support.</p><h3 id="3-what-is-the-difference-between-csl-and-other-citation-style-systems"><strong><strong>3. What is the difference between CSL and other citation style systems?</strong></strong></h3><p>Rintze Zelle: Our main “competition” arguably comes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.refman.com/">Reference Manager</a>. BibTeX is a popular choice for those working with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> typesetting system, but the user base of LaTeX is relatively small and mostly limited to the sciences. EndNote and Reference Manager are commercial tools offered by Thomson Reuters. While large collections of citation styles are available for each program, the use of these styles is limited to licensed users.</p><p>CSL was designed with three main goals:</p><ol><li>to create an open system that is independent of the operating system, application or document format,</li><li>to cover the full range of citation formatting rules in use, extending from the sciences to fields in the humanities as well as law,</li><li>to free end users from the complex task of formatting citations.</li></ol><p>Citation styles should be freely available, up to date, and complete. Switching between styles should be easy, and citation output should automatically localize to the desired language.</p><p>We think we’ve come quite far toward reaching these goals with our most recent release, CSL 1.0. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html">CSL 1.0 specification</a> covers a wide range of citation rules, and offers advanced features like automatic localization of date formats, terms and punctuation, support for in-field rich text and extensive support for the rendering and disambiguation of names. The first standalone CSL 1.0 processor (the JavaScript <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/">citeproc-js</a>) is currently being integrated into both Zotero and Mendeley, and is receiving attention for deployment on both the client and the server.</p><h3 id="4-can-you-tell-me-how-csl-was-developed">4. Can you tell me how CSL was developed?</h3><p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: CSL is the brainchild of Bruce D’Arcus, an associate professor of Geography at Miami University of Ohio. The language was initially implemented for integration into OpenOffice.org, but only became popular in 2006 when Zotero, the first reference manager to use CSL, was released. In these early days major contributions were made to CSL by Zotero developer Simon Kornblith. Subsequently, the Zotero project successfully fostered an active user community, with many users contributing styles to a growing repository of CSL styles.</p><p>The year 2008 was a watershed of new developments. Mendeley was released, the second reference manager to use CSL for its citation formatting. Andrea Rossato released the first standalone CSL processor (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://code.haskell.org/citeproc-hs/">citeproc-hs</a>) for use with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> text processing system. Also in 2008, two Zotero users who enjoyed the program but felt that CSL could be further improved joined Bruce in CSL development: myself, at that time a PhD researcher in biotechnology at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, and Frank Bennett, Jr., an associate law professor at Nagoya University in Japan. Together with Andrea, our different academic and geographic backgrounds proved very useful in CSL development. In preparation for major backward-incompatible changes, CSL 0.8 was released in 2009, and in Spring 2010 CSL 1.0 saw the light of day. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/2010/03/22/citation-style-language-1-0/">1.0 release</a> was accompanied by a move to a new website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/">citationstyles.org</a>, and included improved documentation in the form of a full language specification. CSL development has now calmed down a bit as we await the integration of CSL 1.0 by Zotero and Mendeley.</p><p><strong><strong>Ian Mulvany</strong></strong>: We at Mendeley have been using the Citation Style Language for quite a while now. We think it is an amazing project and we are very strongly committed to working with the CSL community in encouraging uptake. We get a lot of feedback from our users and one area that they constantly run into problems with is the need to be able to format a citation in just such a manner. The CSL project is the best way for us to be able to support the needs of our users with these kinds of requests. Our developers have been pushing patches upstream to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home">citeproc-js</a> project, particularly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/carles-pina/">Carles Pina</a>.</p><p>We have added a cut and paste stylebox on our article pages. If you have a look at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mendeley.com/research/karhunenloeve-eigenvalue-problems-cosmology-we-tackle-large-data-sets/">sample paper</a> you will now see a little citeproc-js driven “Cite this document” box that lets you copy and paste formatted citations in several popular citation styles. We have also been supporting the creation of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/csledit/csl-wysiwyg-editor">WISYWIG citation style editor</a>. The status of the project is that most of the code is complete and we just need to work on getting it integrated into our client, and figuring out the best way to manage the creation of more styles, and how that will work with the CSL community.</p><p>One of the things that we have been discussing with Bruce D’Arcus is how to manage the redistribution of new styles, and how to make sure that corrupt styles don’t propagate, and that people get the style that they are looking for. If people want to contribute there is a lot of activity on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xbiblio-devel">mailing list</a> of the CSL project. One thing we think we hope Mendeley can help with is reporting usage statistics on specific style files, so at least people can find the most popular version of a CSL file for a given style.</p><h3 id="5-where-can-a-user-find-more-csl-citation-styles-is-it-easy-to-modify-a-csl-style">5. Where can a user find (more) CSL citation styles? Is it easy to modify a CSL style?</h3><p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: While anyone is free to write and host their own CSL styles, most CSL styles that are in use are available through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.zotero.org/styles">Zotero Style Repository</a> (many of these styles are licensed under a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons license</a>). We have to admit that editing CSL styles currently requires some technical skill and knowledge of XML. This hasn’t kept members of the Zotero user community from creating over a thousand CSL styles, but we do recognize that user friendly editing of styles is a very important feature. We therefore applaud Mendeley’s effort to create an online CSL editor.</p><h3 id="6-should-publishers-care-about-csl">6. Should publishers care about CSL?</h3><p><strong><strong>Ian Mulvany</strong></strong>: As I pointed out the big publishers don’t care about the submission format, but they have not really done a good job of communicating that to their editorial boards. Smaller publishers don’t have the resources to totally reformat submissions, and beyond academic publishing there are a huge number of people who just need to format citations. There is a huge waste of people’s time in reformatting papers for submissions, in fixing styles according to changing requirements from departments, when what should matter is the content. I’d love to get to a point where every publisher accepted the same type of XML input, and our authoring tools all created content conforming to that input format. Citations should be a DOI or other HTTP URI that can be rendered into the appropriate format using CSL and an API.</p><p><em><em>Martin Fenner: The Open Access publishers BioMed Central and PLoS plan to add a CSL style download link to their author instruction pages. I hope that more publishers follow this example.</em></em></p><h3 id="7-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-csl">7. Do you want to talk about future plans for CSL?</h3><p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: We’re very excited about the work Zotero and Mendeley developers are doing to update their programs to support CSL 1.0. The update path should be relatively smooth for users as styles can be automatically updated to the CSL 1.0 format, although styles will often need to be edited to take full advantage of all the new features. Zotero Everywhere <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/">was announced</a> earlier this week and will include a web citation formatting service based on citeproc-js.</p><p>There are two things we consider crucial to the further development of CSL: one, we still lack an easy way for users to modify existing styles, although we’re hopeful that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/csledit/csl-wysiwyg-editor/">Mendeley’s CSL editor</a> will soon fill this gap. Secondly, we feel there is a need for a more full-featured online style repository which allows users to find their style of choice, to add comments, and to propose style changes.</p><p>The goal of CSL is to make citing formatting easier at a general level, across all fields and in all languages. This can only be achieved through a collaborative endeavor, and here we think publishers also share some responsibility. By providing high quality item metadata through robust standards (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://unapi.info/">unAPI</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a>), by freely providing clear, correct and complete style guidelines or opting for a standard citation style (like APA, Chicago or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mhra.org.uk/Publications/Books/StyleGuide/download.shtml">MHRA</a>), and perhaps even by creating and hosting their own CSL styles, publishers can make our work, and that of authors, so much easier.</p><p>With broad participation and support, we believe that CSL can benefit all fields of scholarship in a similar way Oren Patashnik’s BibTeX helped the sciences, by (further) streamlining the publication process, improving access to metadata of materials of all kinds, and by allowing scholars to spend more of their time on the core of their research.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Scientist,</p><p>last week you published an interesting article by <strong><strong>Christian Specht</strong></strong> about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57689/">Mutations of citations</a>. Dr. Specht found more than 600 wrong citations for the paper by Laemmli (Laemmli 1970), which has been cited at least 88633 times according to Scopus.</p><p><strong><strong>Laemmli UK</strong></strong>. Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4. <em><em>Nature</em></em>. 1970;227:680-685. https://doi.org/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/227680a0">10.1038/227680a0</a></p><p>I was intrigued by the “sequence alignment” in Fig. 1a which clearly demonstrated that point mutations at 2<strong><strong>2</strong></strong>7 and 68<strong><strong>0</strong></strong> are particularly common, and that some mutations are inherited between overlapping groups of scientists. Of particular interest is the “complete nonsense mutation” that attributes the citation to the journal <em><em>Science</em></em>.</p><p>However, the author failed to demonstrate that the citation mutations had a paper-not-found phenotype or whether they were simply silent mutations. Missing is also an analysis of whether the mutations</p><ul><li>originated with the paper authors (who by now should all be using reference managers that automatically import citations),</li><li>were introduced by the publisher during manuscript production (many journals use tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/05/01/extyles-interview-with-elizabeth-blake-and-bruce-rosenblum">eXtyles</a> to check and fix citations in manuscripts), or</li><li>first appeared in the scientific databases that stored the citations (Specht used Web of Science).</li></ul><p>Of particular interest would be whether there is a decrease in mutation rate over time, as automated tools have increased the fidelity of the citation process, and whether any citation style was particularly prone to mutations (no citation style uses checksums). As a researcher I suggest that the burden of proofreading should rest not with paper authors, and that journal and database publishers invest in appropriate citation repair mechanisms. And please use the DOI, even the paper by Laemmli (Laemmli 1970) has one.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><strong><strong>Laemmli UK</strong></strong>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All science bloggers do a lot of reading for background information, or write blog posts based on a (newly published) paper, blog post or news item. So I thought that it would be a good idea to collect those references in a single place.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/17th/1252522330_78b53d7e16.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Day 14 - Visual Representation of a Reading List" loading="lazy" width="500" height="380"><figcaption>Flickr photo by margolove.</figcaption></figure><p>Reading lists are perfect for this, and they are easy to create and maintain with web-based reference managers. Reading lists are used in teaching, e.g. to provide a list of required reading material for a class. But I can also see a number of benefits for science blogs:</p><ul><li>they help the blogger to organize his background material for writing</li><li>they help the reader find and keep referenced material</li><li>they can provide additional reading not mentioned in the blog post</li></ul><p>There are several good tools for reading lists. I decided to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>, because what I really want here is a social bookmarking tool that understands references. My Goobledygook reading list is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/group/13987/library">here</a>, the RSS feed is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/rss/group/13987/library">here</a>, and the most recent items in the reading list are also shown in a new sidebar to the right. I started with references to papers, but plan to also include blog posts and other web resources.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/">The Scholarly Kitchen</a> is a group blog started by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://www.sspnet.org/">Society for Scholarly Publishing</a> in 2008. The blog posts by authors Kent Anderson, Phil Davis, David Crotty, Michael Clarke, etc. are an always interesting – and often thought-provoking – read about scholarly publishing. Two recent posts looked at peer review.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/08/31/the-burden-of-peer-review/">The “Burden” of Peer Review</a><br>In this blog post <strong><strong>David Crotty</strong></strong> argues that we overestimate the amount of time the typical researcher spends doing peer review. In his informal survey most researchers review 1-3 papers per month, and those reviewing many more often do so voluntarily (e.g. because they sit on an editorial board). I haven’t yet checked whether there are any formal surveys on the workload of peer review.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/09/10/post-publication-review-when-the-dialog-of-science-has-become-a-monologue/">Post-publication Review: Is the Dialog of Science Really a Monologue?</a><br>In August the BMJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c3926">published a paper</a> that looked at the adequacy of author replies to electronic letters to the editor. The cohort study found that authors are reluctant to respond to criticism to their work. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c3803">companion editorial</a>, David Schriger and Douglas Altman write about the possible reasons for this inadequate uptake of post-publication peer review, and that we need a change in culture to value public discussion<em><em><em><em><em><em>. </em></em></em></em></em></em><strong><strong>Philip David</strong></strong> summarized the two papers and concluded that <em><em>post-publication review may continue to be spotty and unreliable</em></em>.</p><p>I would disagree with Philip Davis about the conclusions that can be drawn from the cohort study. We all know that many papers receive few if any online comments. But we should rather think about where we could be 3-5 years from now, and how to get there. A recent editorial by Thomas Liesegang in the <em><em>Journal of Ophtalmology </em></em>is very relevant to this discussion (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2009.11.015">Peer review should continue after publication</a>, link via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://ese-bookshelf.blogspot.com/2010/09/b-peer-review-should-continue-after.html">EASE Journal Blog</a>). And Richard Smith gives a wonderful and much broader definition of post-publication peer review in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3803.full/reply#bmj_el_240798">response</a> to the BMJ editorial:</p><blockquote>I would define post-publication review as the process whereby scientists and others decide whether a piece of work matters or not. I suggest that this doesn’t happen much through debate in the correspondence pages of journals, but rather through scientists and other consumers of research recommending others to pay attention to a piece of research, conducting other studies off the back of it, absorbing it into systematic reviews, beginning to act on its conclusions, throwing it in the bin, and taking a thousand other actions that constitute the “market of ideas.”</blockquote>]]></content>

It integrates with Twitter to allow you to list conferences you are organizing, speaking at, attending, or just following. It is a social directory in the sense that everyone can edit this information (I don’t know who started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/science-online-london/">Science Online London 2010</a> page), and that you can see the conferences of your Twitter contacts. Future versions of Lanyrd will do a lot more (you can see some of the upcoming features at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/dconstruct/">dConstruct 2010</a> page), but the site is already useful and just looks gorgeous.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249im_/http://lanyrd.com/static/img/logo/lanyrd-158x158.png" class="kg-image" alt="Lanyrd Logo" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The Lanyrd blog launched yesterday and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/blog/2010/welcome/">the first post</a> contains some interesting background information. Lanyrd is a joint project by web developers and newly-weds Simon Willison and Natalie Downe. They launched Lanyrd from Morocco while on an extended honeymoon and don’t plan to be back to England before the end of next year.</p><p>Sites such as <strong><strong>Eventbrite</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Upcoming</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>Slideshare</strong></strong> have been around for a while. Twitter is becoming an increasingly useful tool for conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/12/lanyrd-a-new-twitter-mashup-for-conferences/The%20Great%20Science%20Online%20London%20Tweetup">The Great Science Online London Tweetup</a>).

Joe Dunckley, Maxine Clarke, Austin Elliott, David Colquhoun, and others wrote thoughtful comments about peer review (the comments are now closed). Peer review is an important topic that I want to write more about on this blog (I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040917/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/13/the-value-of-peer-review">The Value of Peer Review</a> after attending SciFoo 2009).</p><p>Jenny normally writes at Nature Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040917/http://blogs.nature.com/ue19877e8/">Mind the Gap</a>), but for this post was invited as guest blogger for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040917/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/blog-festival">Guardian science blogs</a>.

Geoff first introduced the ORCID initiative, including these principles:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/bilder.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="385"></figure><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/crossref-contributor-id"><em><em>From Slideshare presentation</em></em></a><em><em> by Geoff Bilder.</em></em></p><p>We then talked about two use cases for ORCID.

Gudmundur showed how this workflow could integrate the submission of a manuscript and the corresponding research data. He also demonstrated how datasets in repositories associated with a particular author could be discovered with the help of ORCID.</p><p>But most of the session was dedicated to discussion. As open data was one of the main themes of the conference, the meaning of “open” in ORCID was one of the topics. We talked about how the identifier ORCID could be combined with authentication such as the OAuth system. Phil Lord wanted a modification of the journal submission use case, in that the ORCIDs of authors should be provided with the manuscript, and not entered in the journal submission system. And we talked about whether ORCID should also be used for blog posts, Wikipedia submissions, Slideshare presentations, etc. – I argued that not everything needs to be attributed and measured (see my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/04/unmeasurable-science/">previous blog post</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/4953236107_349c7d7b02_m.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Konferenspåse" loading="lazy" width="180" height="240"><figcaption>Flickr photo by malin_c.</figcaption></figure><p>Today the ORCID initiative reached another important milestone.

For me it was again a fantastic event. Matt Brown is collecting all blog posts, pictures, videos, etc. over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/09/05/science-online-london-2010-index-of-blog-posts-videos-photos-and-stuff">this Nature Network post</a>. As one of the organizers of the conference (mainly helping with the program) I was pretty nervous, and I have to admit that I didn’t sleep well Thursday and Friday. And much better Saturday.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4133/4964420222_41f382e41c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="IMG_0087" loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>Flickr photo by Mendeley.com with me on far left.</em></em></p><p>One important reason to go to a conference is of course to meet the members of your community in real life. It was great to talk to many old friends again, and to meet for the first time in person people I knew from online interactions (Alex Knoll, Brian Mossop, David Dobbs, Matt Cockerill, Jen Mellinn, William Gunn and Jim Caryl and many others not mentioned here). Of course I also missed several friends that came to the first two conferences.</p><p>Of the many impressions of the conference I want to focus on one: <strong><strong>Twitter</strong></strong>.</p><p>Twitter has of course become a mainstream tool to follow conferences. Microblogging for the 2008 conference happened mainly on FriendFeed (the much better tool for conference microblogging and described in this <em><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">PLoS Comp Biol</a></em></em> paper). Every year has seen an increase in Twitter use, and both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://summarizr.labs.eduserv.org.uk/?hashtag=scio10">ScienceOnline2010</a> (#scio10) in January and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://summarizr.labs.eduserv.org.uk/?hashtag=solo10">last week’s conference</a> produced more than 6000 tweets. Towards the end of the conference on Saturday the #solo10 hashtag was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://twitter.com/scottkeir/status/22986296735">#2 trend</a> for London, right before #happbirthdaybeyonce. People not attending the conference were starting to drop in the conversation. We easily beat mainstream science conferences such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting (#asco10) that I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/06/15/using-twitter-at-the-asco-conference">attended earlier this year</a> (almost 5000 tweets, but more than 30.000 attendees). Also interesting: more than 700 people used the #solo10 hashtag in their tweets, even though the conference had only 250 attendees (at least 140 of them with Twitter accounts, listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://twitter.com/LouWoodley/solo10-attendees">here</a>). And some of those not attending were very active twitterers, particularly Bora Zivkovic (@BoraZ).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/4963334783_dcb3fb6163.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="#solo10 Word Cloud" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Flickr image by Simon Cockell.</figcaption></figure><p>Simon Cockell has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blog.fuzzierlogic.com/archives/365">created</a> a Wordle with the conference tweets, which gives a good idea of the topics discussed. The word PDF is a good example. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.mjrobbins.net/">Martin Robbins</a> said in the <strong><strong>Rebooting Science Journalism</strong></strong> panel discussion that “The PDF is an insult to science…” (rightfully so), and this resulted in a longer discussion in the Twitter backchannel.</p><p>That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://alicerosebell.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/taking-science-journalism-upstream/">same panel discussion</a> also made the best use of Twitter as integral part of a session. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/https://twitter.com/christineottery">Christine Ottery</a> was monitoring the Twitter feed and provided feedback for the panelists. We used Twitterwalls for most sessions, but the speakers often did not use information.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/4963802359_790df7b240.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="IMG_0066" loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>Flickr photo by Mendeley.com</em></em></p><p>Twitter several times was also mentioned as an important discovery tool, and I agree that it has become of the best tools to discover interesting stuff, blog posts, papers, etc. I couldn’t attend the <strong><strong>Recommendation Tools for Scientists</strong></strong> session (with Kevin Emamy and Jason Hoyt), so I don’t know whether Twitter as recommendation tool was discussed there.</p><p>It would be interesting to do a more detailed analysis of the #solo10 tweets, e.g. by analyzing which sessions were the most tweeted, what were the most popular keywords and links, or by categorizing tweets into different categories.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday PLoS BLOGs launched with a splash. We (both PLoS BLOGs as a whole and me individually) got a lot of positive feedback and words of encouragement – so we are off to a good start. As both our community manager Brian Mossop and myself are currently in London for the Science Online London Conference, we could celebrate the launch in person. With a good pint of British ale Thursday evening.</p><p>Today I want to talk about something that is sticking in my head since a conversation a few weeks ago with some friends (all esteemed professors in biology or medicine) over another beer. And this has of course been discussed before, both on this blog and elsewhere. Doing science is not only about doing exciting research, and communicating the results to your peers and the public. Measuring scientific output – of funded research projects, a particular researcher, or an institution – seems to be equally important. I would argue that in recent years this has even become the most important aspect of doing science. The successful researcher of today is not necessarily a brilliant mind, skillful experimenter or successful communicator, but a good manager of science. Grants need to be written, collaborations and networks built and maintained, and papers published.</p><p>This is all good and well in the sense that researchers should be held accountable for how they are using their funding, often from public sources. And we want to fund the right projects, i.e. those that have the highest likelihood of achieving something new and exciting. But there are two very big problems with this:</p><h3 id="we-don-t-really-know-how-to-evaluate-science-particularly-in-numbers-that-can-be-used-to-compare-research-projects-">We don’t really know how to evaluate science, particularly in numbers that can be used to compare research projects. </h3><p>This problem is aggravated by the fact that funding (and hiring) decisions are predictions based on past performance. Excellent science by definition is new and groundbreaking, and predicting scientific progress is really hard to do. The past performance of a researcher, the research environment he is working in (colleagues, scientific equipment, etc.), and of course the project outline written down in the proposal are all very helpful. But can we really  predict the next Nature or Cell paper before a project has even started? And the evaluation of scientific output is also extremely difficult. Do you just look at published papers? And if so, how do you evaluate the scientific impact of those papers? Through peer review? By the number of times they were cited? Citation counts have several problems, one of them is the fact that they take a few years to accumulate. The journal a paper is published in? How good an indicator of the impact of the individual paper is that? Should you rather look at download counts or other article-level metrics? We need to think much more about these important issues, as our funding (and hiring) decisions depend on it. I am very happy that I was invited to a workshop by the National Science Foundation this November that will talk about some of these issues. Unique digital author identifiers will play an increasing role in our efforts to tackle the technical aspects of this problem, and I will say something about the ORCID initiative.</p><h3 id="the-evaluation-of-science-is-taking-up-more-and-more-of-our-time-that-is-then-missing-time-for-doing-research-">The evaluation of science is taking up more and more of our time that is then missing time for doing research. </h3><p>Before the first experiment is even started, a project has taken months or sometimes even years of grant writing and grant reviewing. The regulatory requirements are also increasing, and in the case of clinical research involving patients (something I do) can be overwhelming. After a research project is finished, paper writing and reviewing (and writing a report for the funding agency) again takes many months. In the end it might have taken us two years to do the experiments, but five years from beginning to end of the project.</p><p>If we want researchers to do more research – and less grant writing, manuscript writing and peer reviewing (because all this output has to be evaluated by someone), we have to ask funding organizations and institutions to do something about this. There are many possible solutions, and some of them have already been realized:</p><ul><li>Grants can be given for longer periods of time, e.g. 5 years instead of 3 years</li><li>The review of grants could just look at the researcher, and doesn’t try to predict scientific discoveries based on the proposed work</li><li>Smaller grants, e.g. less than $50.000 don’t need to have a concluding report, a link to a paper published with the results should be enough. Similarly we might need fewer progress reports in larger grants.</li><li>Many aspects of grant and paper writing could be made less time-consuming by standardization and automation.</li></ul><p>There is a lot of potential in the last point, and the workflow is broken at many points. Why do researchers have to list their publications in their CV, this information is publicly available? Why does every funding organization want a slightly different format for their grant proposals, can’t we standardize this? Why don’t we have better paper writing tools? Microsoft Word doesn’t really now about the different required sections for a manuscript and is far from perfect for collaborative writing.</p><p>But I have to stop writing now, the second day of the Science Online London Conference is about to begin. I’m wearing my new PLoS BLOGs T-shirt and look forward to another great conference day. I will write about the conference in a separate post in the next fews, but for now let’s just say this conference is even better than in 2009.</p>]]></content>

For me personally it all started a few weeks ago with a phone call one Friday evening from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.php#pbinfield">Pete Binfield</a>, Publisher of PLoS ONE and the PLoS Community Journals.</p><p>Since August 2007 and until today I was blogging over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner">Nature Network</a>. The focus of that blog was how the internet is changing scientific publishing. This is obviously a very broad topic. A lot of my blog posts looked at rather technical aspects, including new products and services (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/29/elsevier-launches-sciverse-integrates-sciencedirect-scopus-more">last post</a> was about Elsevier’s SciVerse that launched last weekend).</p><p>I will continue to write about the same topics. I particularly like to continue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/31/bye-bye-nature-network">interviews</a>, and I want to write more recipes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club</a>). Of course I also want to try different things, e.g. shorter blog posts of interesting stuff I find (something I currently post on Twitter). Please contact me if you have something related to scientific publishing that you want me to write about.</p><p>PLoS Blogs is not the only new science blogging network. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/aug/31/blogging-digital-media">Guardian Science Blogs</a> launched just yesterday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scientopia.org/blogs/">Scientopia</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.science3point0.com/blogs/">Science 3.0</a> in the last few weeks.

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> takes place this Friday and Saturday. Most relevant to the launch of PLoS Blogs is the panel discussion Friday afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel2">The state of science blogging?</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643im_/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/graphics/logo.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Science Online London" loading="lazy"></figure><p>There will of course be other exciting sessions. The panel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel1">“Rebooting” (aka the future of) science journalism</a> with David Dobbs, Ed Yong, Martin Robbins and Alice Bell should be a lot of fun. The closing panel discussion on Saturday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel3">If you build it, will they come?</a> will look at the adoption (or lack thereof) of  Web 2.0 tools for scholarly communication, based on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/communicating-and-disseminating-research/use-and-relevance-web-20-researchers">recent report</a> by the Research Information Network. And a number of sessions focus on open data, a trending topic I’m personally very interested in. Together with Geoff Bilder and Gudmundur Thorisson I will moderate a session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#breakout11">ORCID as unique author identifier: what is it good for and should we worry or be happy?</a></p><p>Most importantly, Science Online London is a great opportunity to meet many of my fellow science bloggers in person, and this includes Brian Mossop, the PLoS Blogs community manager.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Elsevier on Saturday launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://info.sciverse.com/">SciVerse</a>, the new Elsevier platform that combines <em><em>ScienceDirect</em></em> (full-text journal articles) and <em><em>Scopus</em></em> (abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature). In 2011 <em><em>SciTopics</em></em> (research summaries) will also be integrated and outside developers will be able to build SciVerse <em><em>applications</em></em> (Elsevier and 3rd party tools that integrate with ScienceDirect and Scopus). Current users of Scopus and ScienceDirect can continue to use these services or access them from the SciVerse platform.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/sciverse.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Both the ScienceDirect and Scopus service are not available this evening, put the new SciVerse functionality should be available in a few hours. As I had no access to SciVerse prior to the launch today, I will need a few days to have a closer look at both the integration of existing products, and the new features. But obviously missing from the announcement is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.2collab.com/">2collab</a>, Elsevier's social bookmarking service that integrates with Scopus and ScienceDirect.</p><p>Reference managers a few years ago started to store the PDFs of fulltext articles associated with a citation. It is no surprise to see the same trend from developers of abstracts databases. The integration of Scopus with ScienceDirect almost looks like Elsevier's answer to PubMed/PubMed Central. The recently launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK PubMed Central</a> is doing a particularly nice job integrating abstracts and fulltext articles.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of SciVerse is the possibility for 3rd party developers to access the service via APIs and to develop both free and commercial applications. We will see whether SciVerse develops into an open platform that works with other publishers, funders and institutions, or whether SciVerse will become a very large data silo. Elsevier's Rafael Sidi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.researchinformation.info/features/feature.php?feature_id=255">writes</a> that <em><em>Open data and open APIs offer huge opportunities for research and innovation</em></em>, and earlier this week Mendeley's Jason Hoyt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/open-access/researcher-which-side-of-history/">wrote</a> something similar. Data is also at the heart of the business models of many web-based companies – let's hope that these two interests don't collide.</p>]]></content>

The main argument for supplementary information is that sometimes essential information can’t be provided within the context of a journal article (e.g. video, large datasets), especially in those journals that still have print editions. Several blog posts emphasized that supplementary information is particularly important to provide the research data with the article. I think that Heather Piwowar’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">post</a> is the best discussion of the relevant issues.</p><p>I’m obviously two weeks late with this blog posts, but I have been on vacation, and I’m only slowly catching up with all the interesting discussions that have happened while I was away. I think the discussion of supplementary information is very important, because it really is a discussion of our concept of a scientific paper. And this concept is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like">changing rapidly</a> for many reasons, including the push to mobile platforms, and the wish by many to publish multimedia files (e.g. 3D structures) and research data with a paper.</p><p><em>Phil Bourne: Beyond the PDF.</em></p><p>It appears to me that we haven’t talked much about supplementary information, and it really has been something everybody was doing out of necessity, without too much thinking about many of the issues, including standard formats, problems for users finding and storing this supplementary information, and copyright issues.</p><p>Most journals have (often similar) instructions regarding supplementary information, e.g.:</p><ul><li><em>Supplementary Information is peer-reviewed material directly relevant to the conclusion of a paper that cannot be included in the printed version for reasons of space or medium. – </em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/submissions/final/suppinfo.html">Nature</a></li><li><em>Although BMC Medicine does not restrict the length and quantity of data in a paper, there may still be occasions where an author wishes to provide data sets, tables, movie files, or other information as additional information.</em> – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed/ifora/">BMC Medicine</a></li><li><em>Supplemental Information may include additional control data, validation of methods and reagents, primary data, nonprintable media files, or large data sets.

The most interesting aspect for me and several of the bloggers discussing the announcement is the publication of the research data associated with a paper. For now supplementary information is often the only place these data can be published, but there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">many reasons</a> why this is not the best idea in the long run.</p><p>[^1]: This is a perfect example for why we need better systems to track blog posts relating to an article.

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Book Review: Cognitive Surplus by Clay Shirky]]></title>
        <id>60492188933ce912128670aa</id>
        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/book-review-cognitive-surplus-by-clay-shirky"/>
        <updated>2010-08-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his new book <em><em>Cognitive Surplus</em></em> Clay Shirky argues that in the last 50 years many of those living in industrialized countries have seen a dramatic increase in free time, paired with better education and a higher standard of living. But a very large part of that free time or cognitive surplus is now routinely used to watch television, a passive activity that makes us a consumer rather than a participant. In a trend that is also true for other media (eg. music), we have seen a shift away from participation (usually on an amateur level) towards consuming professionally produced media content.</p><p>In the last few years we have seen a dramatic change in Internet technologies that now make it extremely easy for everybody to produce content and distribute it on the Internet (e.g. Wikipedia, blogs, photos on Flickr, or YouTube videos) something we usually call Web 2.0 or social media. Clay Shirky contrasts the time that users spend editing <em><em>Wikipedia</em></em> (or other social media activities) with the hours we typically watch television to kill the argument that most of us would have no time for social media.</p><p>The combination of increased free time and social media is creating a lot of interesting collaborative projects, and the book is full of interesting examples. Clay Shirky stresses that social media only enable new uses of the cognitive surplus, it is how they are used that decides whether we create personal, communal, public or civic values. He uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.icanhazcheeseburger.com/">ICanHazCheeseburger</a> (a popular website that shows cute pictures of cats with cute captions) as an example for communal value, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.apache.org/">Apache Webserver</a> Open Source software project as an example of public value, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi.com</a> (a site started to allow citizens to track outbreaks of ethnic violence in Kenya) as an example of civic value.</p><p>Social media in the context of science and medicine are discussed briefly in the book. Clay Shirky describes the <em><em>Invisible College</em></em>, a group formed around 1645 in London by Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and others that established many of the principles of conducting science that are still valid today (test every hypothesis with experiments, describe experiments detailed enough so that they could be reproduced, etc.). The group formed the core of what a little later became the <em><em>Royal Society</em></em>. Clay Shirky argues that the collaborative nature of how science was conducted by the Invisible College lead to a dramatic increase in our scientific knowledge and contrasts this with how alchemy was performed at the time (reclusive and secretive).</p><p>Clay Shirky also talks about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.patientslikeme.com/">PatientsLikeMe.com</a>, a site that allows patients with chronic diseases to share their health information, both for personal advice, but also as participants in clinical trials. Patients Like Me only works because patients are willing to share their personal healthcare information, and that is a cultural shift from the strict privacy that usually surrounds information about your personal health. Patients participating in Patients Like Me obviously think that the benefits from sharing their personal healthcare information outweigh the risks.</p><p>Cognitive Surplus is very entertaining reading, and on almost every page Clay Shirky gives us food for thought that will keep us busy for days or weeks. The book is required reading for everybody who is interested in how social media are changing the way we consume, communicate, and conduct science. After finishing the book, you will no longer think that the scientific article of the future is primarily about integration of video or other multimedia, intelligent navigation, or display on mobile devices. The successful journals of the future will be those that work hardest in facilitating collaboration among scientists, and this requires cultural changes as much as it requires technological changes.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/what-comes-after-google-wave"/>
        <updated>2010-08-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201336/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html">announced last week</a> that they will stop further development of Google Wave, and essentially shut down the service by the end of the year. Some of the more exciting parts of Wave will be reused in other Google products or – since many parts of Google Wave have been made available under an Open Source license, in products by other companies. But the announcement is an admission that the adoption by users and developers had not been what Google had hoped for with this very ambitious project.</p><p>Google Wave was first announced at Google I/O in May 2009, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201336/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/18/using-google-wave-for-a-week-its-still-great">I had a Google Wave account</a> since July 2009 thanks to being invited to the SciFoo conference (where every attendee got one of those then still rare Wave invites). Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201336/http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-triumph-of-document-layout-and-the-demise-of-google-wave/">others</a>, I saw the tremendous potential to improve on existing tools for researchers to collaborate. But after 12 months, Google Wave hasn't replaced email as communication tool in at least some of my collaborations. Many people have pointed out the reasons for the lack of user adoption of Google Wave. I want to focus on something else: Google Wave tried to solve a problem that is very relevant to scientists, and we still don't have a solution for that problem.</p><p>Email has become the primary tool for many scientists to collaborate with colleagues both within the same institution, and between different institutions. Despite this popularity, email and the typical workflow around it has several significant shortcomings:</p><p><em><em>Email is not good in tracking longer conversations between more than two people.</em></em> Even though email messages can be grouped together, it quickly becomes difficult to follow the discussion. And it is even more complicated for those joining the discussion later.</p><p><em><em>Email is not good in sharing documents.</em></em> Sending large documents repeatedly back and forth is not only a waste of network bandwidth and limited email storage capacities, but is also not a very productive way to collaboratively work on a longer document, as it quickly becomes difficult to merge the different document versions together.</p><p><em><em>Word processors are not good tools to write scientific documents.</em></em> Traditional word processors such as Microsoft Word or LaTeX care too much about document formatting, and still approach a document primarily as something an individual user edits on a single computer.</p><p>Maybe user uptake for Google Wave was low because the approach to tackle these problems was too radical. Many other, less radical tools try to solve the same problems, including mailing lists, wikis, social bookmarking sites such as CiteULike, collaborative writing tools such as Google Docs, and project management tools such as Basecamp.</p><p>Where do we go from here? Because most of the technology behind Google Wave has been made available, we could continue to use and develop Google Wave and Wave extensions for scientists. But that is a very risky strategy that not many people would follow. We can also wait for new tools that help scientists collaborate, and there interesting products announced every few months. For the time being I will continue trying to convince my colleagues to use some of the existing tools instead of email where appropriate, something that is surprisingly difficult.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reference management is a frequent topic on this blog. The last few years we have seen both a large increase in the number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/03/15/reference-manager-overview">available tools</a>, but also big changes in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/19/post">how we use reference management software</a>. But for many of us the first reference management software was Endnote.</p><p>I first used Endnote as a medical student in 1990 (Endnote Plus at that time, published by Niles Software), and I’m still a regular user. I can’t say that for many other programs (probably also Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint, Adobe Photoshop, SPSS and until recently Freehand). The latest version – Endnote X4 – was just released/is about to be released (Windows in June, Macintosh in August). This is a good opportunity to look at how Endnote has changed over the years and why it is still such a popular application. For this I interviewed <em><em>Jason Rollins</em></em>, who is leading the Endnote development team.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/endnote_group.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>Members of the EndNote development team: Jason Rollins, Jiaquan Ma, David Pedrick, Rachel Hubbard, Mayra Aguas, Paul Patanella, Lisa Epps, Lynette Grabow, Howard Harrison, Jennifer Melinn, Bill Colsher, Tilla Edmunds, Gandalf Sollenberger (with the Philadelphia in the background).</em></em></p><h3 id="1-what-is-endnote">1. What is EndNote?</h3><p>Researchers around the world depend on EndNote to simplify collaboration, reference collection, and bibliography formatting. It is these researchers who have molded the EndNote you see today, allowing us to address the pain points as technology evolves. While EndNote originated on the Macintosh and Windows desktops, users now have the added combination of the Web where they can transfer reference groups and share them with colleagues easily. EndNote connects to many parts of the research landscape including online resources for both basic bibliographic information and full text, word processors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</a> for uniquely identifying personal works that will dovetail into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> initiative as well as decreasing time to publish when submitting EndNote formatted documents into publishing systems.</p><h3 id="2-how-is-endnote-different-from-other-reference-managers">2. How is EndNote different from other reference managers?</h3><p>EndNote defined reference management software for generations of researchers and continues to offer the highest quality formatting available in any tool. Today some variation of the core functionality – searching, organizing, sharing, and citing of scholarly reference material – is available in many competing tools.</p><p>Two key differences between EndNote and other reference management tools include gathering and formatting references. First, EndNote is far more accurate and flexible when it comes to the variety of publishing styles it supports. EndNote not only provides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/support/enstyles.asp">over 4,500 formatting styles</a> but it also allows for the most control and customization of this formatting. Our EndNote team works closely with leading publishers and editors across many academic disciplines to ensure that EndNote offers the formatting control our users need to meet exacting publisher specifications. Most of the power of this formatting is built-in and achieved automatically by EndNote – without the user having to think about it. Of course there are many customization options too; these allow users to easily make changes and tweaks to the way EndNote formats citations, footnotes, and bibliographies.</p><p>Second, EndNote offers the best options for easy import and export of user data. The Online Search, Find Full Text, importing, and Web capture options are all features that make it easy to obtain accurate bibliographic information and manage full text data in EndNote. The “RIS Tagged Data” format has become a de facto standard for hundreds of databases and software tools. Plus, the EndNote XML specification is something that is openly shared with partners and competitors alike in hopes of making it easier for our customers to move their data into and out of any system they may need to use.</p><h3 id="3-what-is-new-in-endnote-x4">3. What is new in EndNote X4?</h3><p>There’s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/enx4wnvid/Whats_New-SD.asp">longer list of new and improved features</a>, but a few of the key features are new PDF functions, better support for collaborative writing and more robust footnote handling.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/endnote_screenshot.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>EndNote X4 can create records from PDFs using metadata and a DOI, attaching the original file to the newly created reference. Then, PDFs are further incorporated into users’ libraries by indexing the attached files and making them searchable along with the reference data.</p><p>The connection between EndNote and a word processor is more visible by incorporating cited references from documents right into the EndNote interface. This way, users can work with their references in a word processor, and focus on the references in a particular paper while managing things in EndNote. Editing and managing individual citations in Word now combines all the functionality in one place which is a big help for people working on large projects, or collaboratively. The “Traveling Library” sharing feature in Word has also been significantly improved to help people work together. The APA 6th style is fully supported and EndNote X4 offers much more customization and intelligence to the way footnote formatting styles are handled.</p><p>The full list of features, online videos, and a free trial version of EndNote X4 are available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/">www.endnote.com</a>. EndNote version X4 was released in June for Windows with the Macintosh version available by the end of this summer.</p><h3 id="4-how-does-endnote-handle-pdf-management-can-you-share-pdf-files-with-other-users">4. How does EndNote handle PDF management? Can you share PDF files with other users?</h3><p>With version X4, we have added more PDF-related functionality to EndNote. Now, you can import PDF meta-data and search the full text of attached PDF files. You can share EndNote library files that contain PDF attachments easily – or any other file type. EndNote Web does not currently support direct file attachments but this is something we are currently working on.</p><h3 id="5-what-is-endnote-web-how-does-it-relate-to-endnote">5. What is EndNote Web, how does it relate to EndNote?</h3><p>EndNote provides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnoteweb.com/">EndNote Web</a> to users for easy sharing and collaboration features. Transferring references up to the web provides extra flexibility to work with EndNote references anywhere. There’s a browser plug-in available with EndNote Web, that captures and saves references from web pages and allows users to send references to a desktop or web-based library. The web version has some features that the desktop doesn’t, and vice versa; each is complimentary to the other. EndNote Web is also integrated into the Web of Knowledge database platform and a limited version of EndNote Web is provided to ResearcherID users for managing their personal publication list.</p><h3 id="6-can-i-use-endnote-with-collaborative-writing-tools-such-as-google-docs-or-microsoft-office-live">6. Can I use EndNote with collaborative writing tools such as Google Docs or Microsoft Office Live?</h3><p>While we do not have any custom built plug-ins or similar tools for Google Docs or Microsoft Office Live, as always, it’s easy to drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste in EndNote citations. If you look closely at other products that claim to be compatible, you’ll see that they are offering a simple copy and paste function as well. Based on our research thus far, these writing tools do not yet offer the right APIs to build more robust integration. This is something we hear from customers quite often so we will keep an eye on developments and hope to offer something more once the APIs are available.</p><h3 id="7-how-does-endnote-help-with-reference-management-beyond-writing-manuscripts-e-g-reading-lists-for-students-writing-blog-posts-etc-">7. How does EndNote help with reference management beyond writing manuscripts, e.g reading lists for students, writing blog posts, etc.?</h3><p>You can easily use EndNote to include citations, hyperlinks, or any other reference data into nearly any type of document in almost any format and customize the output for your specific needs. You can share groups of references with both read only and read-write access; this supports sharing reading lists and more involved collaboration. But, reference management has evolved into so much more than just finding things to insert into a document. With the grouping, searching, and file attachment options, EndNote is a way to organize the majority of your research. These features make EndNote robust and flexible at handling a huge volume of items. Plus, you’ve always been able to store files of any type with EndNote, therefore making it possible to utilize much of the organizational capabilities for non-traditional sources like video clips or datasets.</p><h3 id="8-endnote-has-seen-many-updates-since-its-initial-release-more-than-20-years-ago-what-do-you-see-as-some-of-the-most-significant-changes-during-that-time">8. EndNote has seen many updates since its initial release more than 20 years ago. What do you see as some of the most significant changes during that time?</h3><p>EndNote started out for the Mac Plus and DOS; so clearly a lot has changed along with many of the major developments in personal software technology since the late 1980′s. EndNote introduced online searching and direct export to simplify the movement of references from discovery to a personal collection for citing in papers. Cite While You Write is often imitated but never duplicated for ease of use when citing references in Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, and OpenOffice.org Writer. The fundamental problem that EndNote has been solving for our customers has morphed over the years. While keeping up with changes in formatting rules and reference types, which have always been the core strength of EndNote, we have also evolved EndNote into a more complete reference management solution. Where at one time the majority of our users worked alone on a single computer writing a static manuscript, today most customers interact with a global network of collaborators on multiple projects that might be delivered in several formats. Now with EndNote Web and ResearcherID, EndNote users can easily promote their work and connect with others. Another area that has significantly changed over the last twenty years is the means by which users access research material, and as our user’s focus has shifted from basic reference data and description to inclusion of the full text of sources and supporting documentation, EndNote has too. EndNote supports this with OpenURL linking, proxy and open source authentication, browser plug-ins, and other functions.</p><p>Many of the developments we currently have underway will further support online sharing and connectivity and should prove to be some of the most valuable including mobile functionality and more.</p><h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-thomson-reuters">9. What are your responsibilities at Thomson Reuters?</h3><p>My team is responsible for the development of bibliographic management tools. This involves leading the development teams for EndNote and Reference Manager, listening to customer input, and coordinating partnerships.</p><h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-working-at-thomson-reuters">10. What did you do before working at Thomson Reuters?</h3><p>I joined the EndNote team in 2001. Before that, I was completing a PhD in Educational Technology from Drexel University and working for two different consulting firms and a small web start-up.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2010-08-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> is a <em><em>personalized social magazine</em></em> for the iPad. The free application was released on July 22, and instantly created a lot of buzz. Because of the overwhelming interest, they had to create a waitlist for the personal features and I could only sign up for and start using them a few days ago. Flipboard is a true iPad application, it would not work the same on a laptop computer or mobile phone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Flipboard allows you to set up nine sections for different content. You can select them from a predefined list, but the really interesting part is to create your own sections from Twitter users or Twitter lists:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>You can also create a section with all the Twitter accounts you follow. Flipboard will display Tweets in a visually pleasing way. Flipboard doesn't display all Tweets in your Twitter timeline, but filters the most popular and interesting tweets.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>But Flipboard does something else. Rather than just displaying tweets, it follows the links provided in your Twitter stream and displays that information (photos, YouTube videos, blog posts, etc.). It can't handle all the links and for example has problems with links to FriendFeed (very common in my Twitter feed).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>To filter the information, you can also create sections from Twitter lists (or individual users). I had created lists with Science Journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/mfenner/science-journals">@mfenner/science-journals</a>) and Nature Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/mfenner/nature-network">@mfenner/nature-network</a>) bloggers in the past.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Twitter lists are great for following meetings (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/BoraZ/scienceonline2010">@BoraZ/scienceonline2010</a>), but unfortunately Flipboard doesn't yet allow to create sections from Twitter hashtags (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23scifoo">#scifoo</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard6.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>When you click on an individual entry, you will see a longer text, and also Tweets referring to that time as well as a link to the full-text article.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Flipboard does something similar with your Facebook News Feed. It is important to understand that Flipboard is not an RSS reader, but rather a visually pleasing aggregator from News in your Twitter and Facebook networks. Flipboard doesn't present all the information in these networks, but rather filters the most popular and “interesting” stuff.</p><p>How is Flipboard relevant to reading scholarly papers? It can be used out of the box for journals that tweet their table of contents or at least the most interesting papers. And everybody can create a Twitter account that retweets interesting papers in a particular subject area or from a particular institution (ideally this should be integrated with a bookmarking tool such as CiteULike). Scientific publishers could also work with Flipboard to integrate their content (you see in the example above that the scraping used by flipboard sometimes isn't perfect). Almost all scientific papers have an abstract. The abstract would display well in Flipboard, and could then link to the full text at the journal site.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard8.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>To get started reading science blogs on Flipboard, add a ResearchBlogging.org section by subscribing to the @ResearchBlogs Twitter account.</em></em></p><p>Flipboard is of course also a great tool to follow science blogs. It probably works best if a new Twitter account is set up just for that purpose. This account could announce all new posts from a particular blog, or about a particular topic. Twitter lists could then be used for blogging networks such as <em><em>Nature Network</em></em> or <em><em>Scienceblogs.com</em></em>. Flipboard would also work very well to cover the blogging and tweeting of scientific conferences. With all these activities we will very soon need more than the nine sections that Flipboard supports.</p><p><em><em>Update 08/01/10: Added ResearchBlogging.org screenshot.</em></em></p>]]></content>

        <updated>2010-07-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few days we have seen a number of blog posts reflecting on the pros and cons of science blogging networks. Bora Zivkovic last week announced his departure from scienceblogs.com, and in his must-read post reflected on the history of science blogging (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/07/scienceblogs_and_me_and_the_ch.php">A Farewell to Scienceblogs: the Changing Science Blogging Ecosystem</a>). Richard Grant on Saturday wrote down his thoughts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/2010/07/24/on-nature-network">On Nature Network</a>. Cameron Neylon draws an interesting parallel between science networks and scientific journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-nature-of-science-blog-networks/">The Nature of Science Blog Networks</a>). And Katherine Haxton compared her experience blogging on Nature Network vs. blogging on her own blog (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.possibilitiesendless.com/?p=270">Science Blogging Networks</a>).</p><p>My thoughts on this: it's complicated. I don't see how blogging networks (or any particular network) can be inherently better or worse than setting up your own blog. It's an individual decision. Right now I like to write as part of a blogging network. But I may change my mind and write for a different network, or on an individually hosted blog. I would like to add three considerations to the discussion.</p><h3 id="consider-institutional-blogs">Consider institutional blogs</h3><p>We shouldn't forget that there is also a third alternative to blogging networks and individually hosted blogs: a blog hosted by your institution. An institutional blog has a different set of advantages and disadvantages and is therefore not the right choice for everybody. But I will soon start an official blog for the cancer center of my medical school (I've gotten the green light from administration and the PR department, the WordPress 3.0 test system is set up, but it probably will be a few weeks before the first post). I have no intentions stopping the Gobbledygook blog – the new blog will have a different focus, and it will be in German. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://network.nature.com/profile/rpg">Richard</a> have written institutional blogs for years, but this will be new for me – and will also be the first official blog at our university.</p><h3 id="we-need-a-better-aggregator-for-science-blogs">We need a better aggregator for science blogs</h3><p>Most of us probably have subscribed to a good number of science blogs with an RSS reader. The best way to find interesting new posts is probably through links in blogs we read regularly. In addition, we stumble upon interesting posts via links in blog networks, blog rolls, <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, or shared items in <em><em>Google Reader</em></em>.</p><p>In addition, we also need a good aggregator of science blogs. I have to admit that I have stopped using <em><em>Technorati</em></em> a while ago. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature.com Blogs</a> was a good start, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging</a> does a good job of covering blog posts about peer-reviewed literature. But we probably can do much better. Whether the best strategy would be to put more resources into one of the existing services (see also Lou's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/2010/07/24/on-nature-network#comment-61864">comment</a> from earlier today), or whether to start building something new, I don't know. But there is a lot of potential for building a better discovery service that at the same time will become an interesting archive of what the science blogosphere is talking about. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/20/streamosphere-interview-with-euan-adie">Streamosphere</a> is already a good step in the right direction.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/3849275338_d77a382643.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="375" height="500"><figcaption>Flickr Photo by Eva Amsen. Taken during Science Online London 2009 at the Royal Institution.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="personal-interactions-are-important">Personal interactions are important</h3><p>It is usually much more rewarding to interact with someone online whom you have also met in person. This is true not only for scientific collaborations, but of course also for social media. This is obviously much easier if you live in places like London, but even Hannover (where I live) has a really nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/11/action-points">Science 2.0 community</a>. And this is why science blogging conferences such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/">ScienceOnline2010</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London 2010</a> are so important. Science Online London is only six weeks away (September 3-4 at the British Library), and I'm really excited not only about the program, but also because of all the people I will for the first time or again meet in person.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/discuss-papers-with-journalfire"/>
        <updated>2010-07-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago I wrote a blog post about how to use Web 2.0 tools for a journal club (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club</a>). Although reference management tools such as <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> and <em><em>Mendeley</em></em> can be used for journal clubs, discussion features are often more of an afterthought. At the time I therefore recommended FriendFeed. In February of this year, ScienceFeed was released (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/15/sciencefeed-interview-with-ijad-madisch">ScienceFeed: Interview with Ijad Madisch</a>). It is very similar to FriendFeed, but is smarter about finding and storing references to scientific literature. Unfortunately ScienceFeed integrates very tightly with ResearchGate. You have to sign up for both services to use the reference management features.</p><p>Last week a new web-based tool specifically for Journal Clubs was released. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/">JournalFire</a> was created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/johnmdelacruz">John Delacruz</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/riccardoschmid">Riccardo Schmid</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/timhill">Tim Hill</a>. JournalFire is free for public discussion groups, but costs money for private groups with more than 4 members.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/journalfire.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Feel free to participate in the discussion about this article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/node/70269107">here</a>. I've picked a paper that is not only freely available and nicely written, but also in a very hot field.</p><h3 id="what-i-like">What I like</h3><p>JournalFire really focuses on discussion around a paper. Journal Clubs are used to organize the discussion, similar to groups in other tools. The interface is uncluttered, and almost everything is available as RSS feed.</p><h3 id="what-i-would-like">What I would like</h3><p>JournalFire was just released publicly, so it obviously doesn't have all the features of a more mature product. More importantly, JournalFire covers a fairly specific reference management niche, it is therefore important that data exchange with other reference management tools is as easy as possible.<br>JournalFire has a bookmarklet similar to what other reference managers offer, and you can export one or more references in Endnote or BibTex format. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a> support should be an obvious addition, and an API would allow tighter integration with other tools, e.g. to add Journal Club features to your CiteULike, Mendeley or Zotero library.</p><p>The Journal Club concept of JournalFire fills a very interesting niche. But in the end, social tools for scientists are about critical mass. It will be interesting to see whether JournalFire can attract enough users in this very crowded market.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I attended the fabulous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.open.ac.uk/telstar/event">Innovations in Reference Management</a> workshop in Birmingham organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.twitter.com/ostephens">Owen Stephens</a> from Open University. Owen has written <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/telstar/tag/irm10/">some blog posts</a> summarizing the sessions almost in real time. You also find a good number of interesting tweets under the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23irm10">#irm10</a>. My presentation was called <em><em>Trends in Reference Management</em></em>:</p><p>I started my presentation by giving a brief historical perspective on how reference management has evolved during the past 25 years. It seems as if many users today use reference managers the same way as users did in 1992 (when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci00010a601">this review of Endnote</a> was written): a database of (mostly) journal articles installed on your desktop computer that can fetch references directly from online databases (in 1992 we had Endlink and the Z39.50 protocol for that) and that inserts bibliographies into Microsoft Word. It is odd that many seemingly old problems still exist today:</p><ul><li>Digital Object Identifiers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.doi.org/">DOIs</a>) were introduced in 2000, and many journals not only are using them, but also exist only as electronic versions. Nevertheless most citation styles still use volumes, issues and page numbers instead of the DOI. And some journals and online databases (e.g. PubMed) still don’t display the DOI prominently, but rather use their own numbering scheme.</li><li>Most reference managers allow sharing of reference in private or public groups. We have collaborative writing tools (Google Docs, Zoho Writer, Adobe Buzzword, and now even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://workspace.officelive.com/">Microsoft Office Live Workspace</a>) since at least 2006, but I think that no reference manager supports them beyond a simple copy and past function.</li><li>Almost all journal articles can be downloaded as PDF files, but users are still confused what they are allowed to do with these PDFs. Many publishers don’t even allow redistribution of these PDFs within an institution (e.g. for a journal club), something that is probably often ignored. These problems obviously don’t exist for Open Access publications, but it again gets complicated with those publishers that use a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Creative Commons Noncommercial license</a>. And to the best of my knowledge, no reference manager is providing copyright information for its references.</li></ul><h3 id="mobile-applications-for-reference-management">Mobile Applications for Reference Management</h3><p>In the next part of my presentation I briefly talked about some of the mobile applications handling scientific journal articles (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.nature.com/mobileapps/">Nature</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2010/03/22/introducing-the-plos-medicine-iphone-application/">PLoS Medicine</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://blogs.nejm.org/now/index.php/introducing-the-nejm-this-week-iphone-app/2010/06/18/">NEJM</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://info.scopus.com/mobile">Scopus</a> for iPhone and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plos-reader/id370880976">PLoS Reader</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://mekentosj.com/papers/ipad/">Papers for iPad</a>) that have been released in the last few months. The small screen of mobile phones makes it difficult to read scientific papers (especially the tables and figures). The best use case is probably the scanning of journal table of contents or search alerts with bookmarking of interesting papers for later reading. In other words, a perfect job for a RSS reader synchronized with the desktop.</p><p>The iPad is a very different story, as for me it is a very good device for reading a scientific paper – better than a desktop computer and even better than a printout if you don’t have a color printer. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://mekentosj.com/papers/ipad/">Papers for iPad</a> is the perfect software for this use case, especially if you also own Papers for Mac and can simply transfer all your PDF files complete with reference information to the iPad.</p><h3 id="orcid">ORCID</h3><p>I then moved on to give a brief introduction to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> initiative (most of my slides were kindly provided my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/crossref-contributor-id">Geoff Bilder</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/hratner/introduction-to-orcid-stm-spring-2010">Howard Ratner</a>). Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID aims to provide a universal unique identifier for researchers. Past approaches have not gained universal acceptance because they were restricted to a particular discipline (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.repec.org/">RePEec</a>), country (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/amandahill/names-project-update">Names Project</a>) or were started by a single private company (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://info.scopus.com/scopus-in-detail/tools/authoridentifier/">Scopus Author Identifier</a>). ORCID is a broad initiative with already more than 100 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.orcid.org/gallery.php">participating organizations</a>. ORCID <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">was announced</a> in December 2009, and the initiative is currently working hard to first incorporate as a non-profit organization and then launch a first public prototype (based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.researcherid.com:80/Home.action">ResearcherID</a> software). Both milestones are planned for later this year.</p><p>Reference managers will of course benefit from a widely accepted author identifier, e.g. by making it much easier to find all publications from a particular author. ORCID can also be used to track other scientific contributions, e.g. peer review, blog posts, presentations or primary research datasets. Reference managers could also track (some of) these contributions by researchers.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended the annual meeting of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.asco.org/">American Society of Clinical Oncology</a> (ASCO) in Chicago. For my work it is the most important scientific meeting of the year, and it is also by far the biggest with more than 30.000 participants.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4691440146_bcaea61ee0.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Chicago last Thursday. Flickr image by ifmuth.</figcaption></figure><p>Blogging is a great way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/17/scienceonline2010-i-wish-i-was-there">report from conferences</a>, and for me <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> is the best microblogging tool to do that. Its use at the 2008 ISMB conference was nicely described in a <em><em>PLoS Comp Biol</em></em> paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263</a>) by Neil Saunders et al. Unfortunately it seems as if the use of FriendFeed is declining at every online science conference I go to, as everybody seems to be switching to <em><em>Twitter</em></em>. At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://bibcamp.wordpress.com/">BibCamp</a> that we organized in May we didn't even bother trying FriendFeed (or similar microbloging tools such as Google Buzz, ScienceFeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://hotpotato.com/">Hot Potato</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.snapgroups.com/">Snapgroups</a> or Google Wave).</p><p>My main problem with using Twitter at conferences is that it is difficult to connect all tweets talking about a particular session together. General hashtags like <em><em>#asco10</em></em> are not a solution for conferences with several thousand tweets. The ASCO conference organizers asked us to use two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.asco.org/ascov2/MyASCO/Twitter">special hash tags</a> for some sessions, but it seemed as if almost nobody was using them. I would not be surprised if someone invents (or has already done so) a nice service that connects tweets to conference sessions.</p><p>Another shortcoming of Twitter is the lack of automatic long-term archiving. Therefore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.twitter.com/RMEOncology">@RMEOncology</a> created a Twapper Keeper that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://twapperkeeper.com/hashtag/asco10">used to archive</a> the about 4500 tweets with the <em><em>#asco10</em></em> hashtag. You can do interesting things with such an archive, Cornelius Puschmann did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://wisspub.net/2010/05/11/bibcamp-auswertung/">analysis</a> of the Twitter activity at our recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/11/action-points">BibCamp</a> using the R statistical software.</p><p>On the second conference day we were invited by the ASCO organizers to a tweetup. We were twice as many people compared to the tweetup at last year's ASCO (including one familiar face, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.twitter.com/MaverickNY">@MaverickNY</a>). We had an interesting discussion for about an hour. The most important message for me: we were encouraged to freely tweet about the sessions, restricted only by common sense and not a particular policy. A large meeting like ASCO with a lot of press coverage and videotaping of most sessions obviously has it easier to allow widespread Twitter use than a smaller meeting like the Cold Spring Harbor Biology of Genomes meeting. The discussions at that meeting in May were nicely covered by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/05/what_a_difference_a_year_makes.php">Daniel MacArthur</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/can-you-tweet-from-cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-meetings/">Ivan Oransky</a>.</p><p>ASCO was also the first conference that I attended with an iPad. We had free WiFi (that worked in most places) and the iPad was great to write Tweets, look through the PDF of the sessions and posters I wanted to see (created back home), and to keep in touch via email and Skype. The only caveat: adding links to Tweets was difficult without multitasking – although this should become easier with the soon to be released iOS 4.</p><p>I did not like all Tweets about the conference. Twitter was obviously also used as a marketing tool. Although there is nothing wrong with that, some pharma companies felt it necessary to tweet exactly the same message again and again. I would have like more tweets reporting key findings from the sessions and/or adding comments or interesting links (e.g. with background information). But I'm optimistic that Twitter coverage at ASCO11 will be even better, and that by ASCO12 Twitter will be as mainstream and popular as email was at ASCO10.</p><p><em><em>Starting tomorrow, I will also write for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://lindau.nature.com/">Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting</a> blog (the meeting itself will start June 27).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Social media and privacy have a complicated relationship, as using social media implies giving up at least some privacy. And the value of a social networking site is directly related not only to the number of users, but also the extend of personal data that the site has collected. All this is of course not unique to social networking tools for scientists, but conducting science using online tools is different from connecting to friends or people with similar personal interests with these tools. One area where privacy issues are particularly prominent is the creation of unique identifiers for scientists, and here I'm involved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> initiative. We need a discussion about required privacy standards, and about the limitations of privacy that we accept in order to increase our scientific productivity.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/2404940312_e759c4030d.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="375" height="500"><figcaption>Flickr image by rpongsaj.</figcaption></figure><p>I've collected a couple of thoughts below. They are of course only starting points for a discussion, and I welcome any comments and suggestions.</p><h3 id="1-the-service-allows-anonymous-access">1. The service allows anonymous access</h3><p>Social networking sites for scientists can be quite useful for anonymous users, e.g. for reading of blog or forum posts. Users should not be required to sign up for a service just for reading a public message or looking at the public part of a user profile. Many social networking sites unfortunately require a user account these activities, and they often nag users to “complete their personal profiles”, i.e. to provide as much personal information as possible.</p><h3 id="2-the-service-has-a-privacy-policy">2. The service has a privacy policy</h3><p>I've randomly checked five social networking sites for scientists, and they all provide a privacy policy:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.academia.edu/privacy">Academia.edu</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.citeulike.org/privacy">CiteULike</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.mendeley.com/privacy/">Mendeley</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://network.nature.com/site/privacy">Nature Network</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.researchgate.net/application.PrivacyPolicy.html">ResearchGate</a></li></ul><p>The privacy policy should make clear what user data the service is collecting, whether the service is providing these user data to third parties, and should provide an email address for further privacy questions.</p><h3 id="3-personal-data-are-owned-by-the-user">3. Personal data are owned by the user</h3><p>All personal data that a user uploads should be owned by the user, and the privacy policy should make this clear. This implies that a user should be allowed to cancel an account and delete all personal information (surprisingly difficult with most social networking sites), and that the user decides which part of the personal data is shared with others, and with whom.</p><p>To give users control over their privacy settings, these settings should default to not being public for everything beyond the most basic information, and they should not change over time (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/">The Evolution of privacy on Facebook</a>).</p><p>Obviously there is a large grey area. If I comment on a blog post by someone else, who owns this comment, and who should be allowed to delete this comment – me, the author of the blog post, and/or the provider of the social networking site? And who owns my usage data of a service, how often I logged in, my activity in the service, etc.?</p><h3 id="4-the-service-protects-the-user-data">4. The service protects the user data</h3><p>The social networking site should make all efforts necessary to protect the personal data of a user. There are examples where this has gone wrong, and this includes examples involving scientists (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090423/full/news.2009.398.html">Fake Facebook pages spin web of deceit</a>).</p><p><em><em>Update 5/25/10: I didn't see it when I wrote the post, but last week the Electronic Frontier Foundation published a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/05/bill-privacy-rights-social-network-users">Bill of Privacy Rights for Social Network Users</a> (thanks to Renny Guida for the link).</em></em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Next month I will participate in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://www.open.ac.uk/telstar/event/programmet">Innovations in Reference Management</a> event organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://twitter.com/ostephens">Owen Stevens</a> from the Open University. My own presentation has the title <em><em>Trends in Reference Management</em></em>, where I will try to focus on three emerging areas:</p><ul><li>Use of mobile devices for reference management (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/08/nature-com-iphone-app-in-pictures">Nature.com iPhone App</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://mekentosj.com/papers/ipad/">Papers for iPad</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://info.scopus.com/mobile/">Scopus Alerts for iPhone</a>)</li><li>Social networks as discovery tools (using CiteULike, Twitter, FriendFeed, ResearchBlogging.org, etc. for finding relevant references instead of keyword searches in databases)</li><li>Integration of unique author identifiers (specifically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">ORCID</a>) into reference management tools. This will allow many interesting uses of reference lists (e.g. for automated researcher profiles or evaluation)</li></ul><p>Reference management has obviously come a long way from the desktop applications <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci00010a601">created 25 years ago</a>. In 2010 it is difficult to give a good description of the typical functions of reference managers. My 8 answers are below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman1.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>At their core all reference managers are databases that store references. They should allow the user to create or import all required reference types, find duplicate records, and connect references by the same author or published in the same journal. I don't think any reference manager completely supports even this small feature set (most of them don't do author disambiguation). And we rarely use reference managers in a much broader sense, e.g. for storing important blog posts or references to research datasets (as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://bit.ly/do6Ujj">suggested by Cameron Neylon</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman2.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Reference managers should put references into manuscripts, allowing a variety of citation styles. Only a few reference managers allow the user to edit citation styles, an important feature if an obscure style is required. Surprisingly, the functionality for reference management is usually not built into most word processors, but rather provided by the reference management software.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman3.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>All reference managers can import references directly from bibliographic databases, either by direct database connections, or via bookmarklets.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman4.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Some reference managers (most notably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a>) not only manage references, but also organize the full-text PDF files associated with them. There are many good reasons to keep the assets (such as scientific papers) and their metadata (the references) connected, e.g. to allow full-text searches in your reference manager. Scientific journals have started to embed reference metadata in full-text PDF files (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP Labelling for Nature</a>), making it easier to connect reference and PDF file.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman5.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Many reference managers now offer a web-based version. This allows using the same reference database with more than one computer and sharing of references with others. Some reference managers (e.g. CiteULike, RefWorks) only provide a web-based version.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman6.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman6.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Many bibliographic databases (e.g. PubMed or Scopus) now allow user accounts with storing of search strategies, interesting references, etc. Does that make them reference managers?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman7.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The flow of reference information has become much more complicated than simply from online database to reference manager to manuscript. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/03/bibapp-mashups-for-universities">Institutional bibliographies</a> are a good example.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman8.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="refman8.jpg" loading="lazy"></figure><p>More and more we find interesting references not via keyword searches in databases, but rather through our social networks. This could be via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blog.citeulike.org/?p=136">CiteULike recommendations</a>, blog posts discussing a paper on ResearchBlogging.org, or one of your contacts talking about an interesting paper on Twitter, FriendFeed or Facebook. Current reference managers don't provide good functionality to handle this user behavior.</p>]]></content>

And Steffi Suhr wrote a nice post about <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/stuffysour/2010/05/09/the-most-beautiful-library-in-the-world">The most beautiful library in the world</a> in her <em><em>Nature Network</em></em> blog.</p><p>The BarCamp format worked very well for us – we used traditional pen and paper for session planning:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/p1060059.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="375"><figcaption>Me, helping with session planning last Friday. Picture by <a href="http://edlf.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/bibcamp-2010-tag-1/">Martin Kramer</a> .</figcaption></figure><p>I had suggested a session about <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/bibapp-mashups-for-universities">Institutional Bibliographies</a>. We combined this with two related suggestions and had a very interesting session about the communication of scientists with librarians. One interesting theme in the discussion was the notion that the scientific workflow seems to be broken at some specific steps, for example:</p><h3 id="deposition-of-post-prints-in-institutional-repositories">Deposition of post-prints in institutional repositories</h3><p>Most journals allow authors to make the final version of an accepted manuscript (i.e. after peer review) <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeoinfo.html#prepostprints">publicly available</a> via an institutional repository. Most librarians would be happy to help their authors with this step, but unfortunately have no good tools to track the papers published at their institution, and never see the final version of accepted manuscript (many journals don't allow publisher-generated PDFs in repositories).</p><h3 id="re-submission-of-rejected-manuscripts">Re-submission of rejected manuscripts</h3><p>Rejected manuscripts are usually resubmitted to a different journal (most manuscripts will eventually be published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000254668.63378.32">somewhere</a>). Unfortunately the next journal will most likely use a different manuscript format, different citation styles and a different manuscript submission system. Some journals provide a <a href="https://www.nature.com/authors/author_services/transfer_manuscripts.html">manuscript transfer service</a>, but the comments made in the peer review are usually not available to the editors and reviewers of the next journal.</p><h3 id="connecting-scientists-to-publications">Connecting scientists to publications</h3><p>This is a topic that I have written about before (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">ORCID or how to build a unique identifier for scientists in 10 easy steps</a>). Until we have unique author identifiers, it is difficult or impossible to reliably find the papers published by a particular person (a good number of papers by <em><em>Fenner M</em></em> in <em><em>PubMed</em></em> are not written by me).</p><h3 id="distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Distributing papers for a journal club</h3><p>Another topic I have written about before (<a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club</a>). The problem is not only that email is really bad for sending PDF files to a group of people, but that most journals don't allow redistribution of their content, even within an institution with an institutional subscription.</p><h3 id="citation-counts">Citation counts</h3><p>The number of times a paper is cited is often used as a proxy to the importance of the science in that paper. Citation counts (e.g. in the form of Impact Factor or H-Index) are often used to evaluate researchers. There are many problems with this approach, because citation counts are influenced by many other factors (e.g. time, popularity of the subject area, self-citations). But the biggest problem is the fact that there is no general agreement on how to count citations, and no database that makes this information freely available.</p><p>It might make sense to make a list of these broken steps, and then estimate the effort that would be required to fix each of them. Some broken steps are more important, and some fixes easier than others, so this exercise would give a good list of action points.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Friday afternoon discussions can be dangerous. Last Friday I talked with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://network.nature.com/people/UC0402CE6/profile">Heinz Pampel</a> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=137">Helmholtz Open Access Initiative</a> via email about the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://bibcamp.wordpress.com/">BibCamp Hannover</a> (a barcamp for librarians and others interested in online science that will take place this weekend). I said that I was looking for a solution to make the list of publications from our institution more accessible – we currently store them in a regularly updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.refworks.com/refshare/?site=047931198224000000%2F">RefWorks database</a>. Heinz not only told me that there is actually a name for this kind of tool (Current Research Information System or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.cris2010.org/">CIRS</a>), but also gave me some good links. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:152805/Simon_Porter.pdf">This talk</a> by Simon Porter from the University of Melbourne is for example a very good introduction to the topic.</p><p>Heinz also suggested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://bibapp.org/">BibApp</a>, a nice web-based tool for exactly this purpose written in the <em><em>Ruby on Rails</em></em> programming language. Because I am a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/en/">very familiar with Ruby on Rails</a>, I took a closer look.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://vimeo.com/2104723">Bibapp – Find Campus Experts</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://vimeo.com/user885968">Eric Larson</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p>In the end I spent a good deal of this weekend setting up <em><em>BibApp</em></em>, importing all publications from our institution since 2008 via <em><em>Refworks</em></em>, starting to add researchers and research groups and adjusting <em><em>BibApp</em></em> to our needs (mainly changing the layout to our institution style and starting to translate the templates into German). <em><em>BibApp</em></em> is already a fully working system and is telling me some interesting things. This includes many interesting papers from our institution that I didn't know about, but also that two researchers each have published more than 150 papers in two years, and that my colleagues have published 6 papers in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411168">Medical Hypotheses</a> since 2008. The technical aspects of setting up <em><em>BibApp</em></em> are almost solved (it helps that I run two other <em><em>Ruby on Rails</em></em> applications at my institution), so now I have to convince our library and administration that it's worth having (and maintaining) such a CRIS tool.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/4572784486_52fff91a71.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="361"></figure><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/04/17/improving-the-conduct-of-science">Two weeks ago I wrote about the upper part of the figure</a> (for a <em><em>NSF</em></em> workshop that got postponed to September because of the Volcano ash). As far as I can see, there is no standard between funding agencies for grant reporting, and both DataCite and ORCID are fairly new initiatives.</p><p>The CRIS can be used to facilitate access to institutional repositories or primary research datasets. <em><em>BibApp</em></em> supports the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue54/allinson-et-al/">SWORD</a> protocol for article deposition, and it automatically checks all papers against the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">ROMEO</a> database of publisher copyright policies. A CRIS is a great discovery tool and it can be further enhanced by integration with social networking tools (e.g. with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/04/28/coming-soon-all-new-nature-network">new Nature Network</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/press-release/announcing-mendeley-open-api/">Mendeley API</a> both announced a few days ago).</p><p>The main interest of administrations if of course evaluation of research output. A CRIS can be used to do exactly that, and it has two advantages: a) it can automate some of the processes that are currently done manually by researchers (regularly collecting and reporting information about grants and publications), and b) it is a great platform to develop new tools for the evaluation of scientific output. My institution currently evaluates using the <em><em>Impact Factor</em></em> of the published papers, and takes first and last authorship (and female authors) into consideration. A CRIS would allow an institution to use similar tools as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action">PLoS Article-Level Metrics</a> (usage data, citation data, usage by social networking tools) instead of the <em><em>Impact Factor</em></em>, and several projects are already trying some of that, e.g. the German <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english/">Open Access Statistics</a> project.</p><p>But the best thing about CRIS tools in general, and <em><em>BibApp</em></em> in particular, is that they add a lot of value for relatively little effort. Universities don't want to (and can't) compete with large institutions or companies such as scientific publishers. Because they basically just integrate the data that are already available in an intelligent way (Mashup in Web 2.0 language), they require a reasonable effort to maintain. This will be particularly true once the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> system of unique author identifiers is in place, because author disambiguation is currently one of the most time-consuming aspects (even though <em><em>BibApp</em></em> is pretty smart about this). I'm looking forward to adapt <em><em>BibApp</em></em> to the <em><em>ORCID</em></em> prototype system that is planned for this summer.</p>]]></content>

The initiative was first announced last December, and is supported by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.orcid.org/gallery.php">growing number</a> of publishers, scholarly societies and academic institutions. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/">Thomson Reuters</a> is not only one of the founding members of the initiative, but will also provide the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</a> technology as a starting point for building the <em><em>ORCID</em></em> platform.</p><p>I asked <em><em>Renny Guida</em></em> from Thomson Reuters a few questions about his thoughts on unique author identifiers in general, and <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> and <em><em>ORCID</em></em> in particular.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/researcherid.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>Members of the ResearcherID team (from left to right): Renny Guida, Ellen Rotenberg, Chiu Chung and Deepak Chaturvedi.</em></em></p><h3 id="1-what-is-researcherid">1. What is ResearcherID?</h3><p><em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is a freely available system that helps the research community overcome the issues of individual name ambiguity and attribution. The system is available to everyone and allows a researcher to establish, maintain and control a biographic and bibliographic profile.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015im_/http://images.isiknowledge.com/WOK48B3/images/RID/rid_logo.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The system is the result of research that found that individual identity touches many parts of scholarly communications and that researcher’s and academic institutions were ready to take some ownership of the issue to ensure proper attribution of scholarship.</p><p>The Registry is composed of biographical and bibliographic components which are accessible at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/">researcherid.com</a> web site. A web services API makes it possible for an institution or organization to create and use this information in their systems.</p><p>The biographical component of the registry creates a unique identifier and persistent web location for each user. The system is designed to allow a researcher to control privacy and access to the information in their profile, even if the information was uploaded by the researcher’s institution. Researchers can enter and manage information about themselves, their work and their affiliations (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/rid/C-3246-2009">example record</a>).</p><p>The bibliographic component of <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> allows researchers to connect articles, patents and other scholarly items to their profile. Items can be loaded from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.isiwebofknowledge.com/">Web of Science</a> or in a text format into one of three lists.</p><p>As I mentioned, a web service makes it possible for organizations to create and manage both biographic and bibliographic information for their faculty and researchers. Upload, download and search services make this possible. For example, David Palmer at the University of Hong Kong uses ResearcherID to create <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://hub.hku.hk/rp/rp00023">identifiers for HKU researchers</a>.</p><h3 id="2-what-is-orcid-and-how-does-it-relate-to-researcherid"><em><em>2. What is ORCID, and how does it relate to ResearcherID?</em></em></h3><p>Open Researcher Contributor ID (ORCID) is an initiative to better understand how the issue of individual name ambiguity can be solved. Currently a cross section of the research community is discussing ways to overcome the issue with the hopes of establishing an open registry that will be used by the global research community.</p><p>One of the lessons learned from Thomson Reuters’ development of <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is that issues of name ambiguity and attribution are problems bigger than any one organization can address. And, having multiple solutions to the problem will not meet the needs of researchers or the scholarly community. Based on <em><em>ResearcherID’s</em></em> innovation and success in addressing these issues, Thomson Reuters plans to offer <em><em>ORCID</em></em> the technology and infrastructure for managing the biographic registry.</p><p>The initiative has grown from early 2009 conversations between <em><em>Thomson Reuters</em></em> and <em><em>Nature Publishing Group</em></em> into a global collaboration of academic institutions, research centers, funding agencies, scholarly societies and publishers. To date, everyone involved in the effort is volunteering their time and work is focused on the business and technical implications of creating an independent organization to manage an identity registry system. More information on the initiative can be found at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> web site.</p><h3 id="3-there-are-numerous-other-initiatives-for-unique-researcher-identifiers-what-is-unique-about-researcherid">3.There are numerous other initiatives for unique researcher identifiers. What is unique about ResearcherID?</h3><p>What is unique about <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is that it is a global initiative and not focused on any one organization, consortia, country or application. The system also ensures privacy and allows researchers to control their information. The <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is portable and can be included in authored works and used as a dynamic link on the researcher’s website.</p><h3 id="4-how-does-researcherid-integrate-with-other-thomson-reuters-products-and-outside-tools">4. How does ResearcherID integrate with other Thomson Reuters products and outside tools?</h3><p>The system was designed to allow all users, independent of any Thomson Reuters subscriptions, to benefit from the application. All users have the ability to establish an identifier, create and manage a biographical profile, and manage a list of scholarly works.</p><p>The <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> system is closely coupled with EndNote and by May 2010, all ResearcherID users, independent of any Thomson Reuters subscriptions, will have access to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.endnoteweb.com/">web version of EndNote</a>.</p><p>For users having access to the <em><em>Web of Knowledge</em></em> there are a number of additional integration points:</p><ul><li>Researchers can claim items from the <em><em>Web of Science</em></em> by either performing a search or using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://images.isiknowledge.com/WOK46/help/WOS/h_da_sets.html">Distinct Author Sets</a> feature that automatically clusters articles believed to be authored by the same person.</li><li>Researchers can claim items from any <em><em>Web of Knowledge</em></em> database.</li><li>The ResearcherID system uses the <em><em>Web of Science</em></em> to automatically update the ResearcherID system with the times cited count.</li><li><em><em>Web of Science</em></em> times cited information is used to generate personal citation reports and the citation visualizations (currently being tested in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://wokinfo.com/researcherid/ridlabs/">ResearcherID labs</a> environment) to visualize collaboration and citation networks.</li></ul><h3 id="5-do-you-plan-to-continue-with-researcherid-once-orcid-is-fully-working">5. Do you plan to continue with ResearcherID once ORCID is fully working?</h3><p>Our plans are to adapt and enhance <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> to support <em><em>ORCID</em></em> and allow users access to personal citation functionality and services on our <em><em>Web of Knowledge</em></em> platform. Thomson Reuters is one of the catalysts of the <em><em>ORCID</em></em> initiative and is working with our colleagues to help <em><em>ORCID</em></em> succeed. We will fully support <em><em>ORCID</em></em> from the enhanced <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> platform and other Thomson Reuters applications.</p><h3 id="6-what-would-be-the-benefits-of-using-a-unique-author-identifier-for-a-researcher">6. What would be the benefits of using a unique author identifier for a researcher?</h3><p>The unique author identifier not only addresses the issues of name ambiguity and attribution but benefits the scholarly communication process by maintaining the link between the researchers and their scholarship. This link is critical given the proliferation of information available on the Web and the demand to find information in less time and with greater accuracy.</p><p>The real benefit comes when all involved in the scholarly communications can leveraged the identifier to improve the process. Easier tenure review, better assessment of research output, more intelligent discovery tools, enhanced peer review systems and tools to maintain scholarly networks are some of the benefits of using a unique author identifier.</p><h3 id="7-where-do-you-see-the-biggest-obstacles-in-launching-a-universally-accepted-unique-identifier-for-researchers-technical-or-social">7. Where do you see the biggest obstacles in launching a universally accepted unique identifier for researchers? Technical or social?</h3><p>I see two large obstacles. The first, and I believe most important, is the researchers perception of security and ownership. The system must allow researchers to control and manage their data.</p><p>The second biggest obstacle is the sustainability of an organization that would provide the identity service. <em><em>ORCID</em></em> is proving that the community can work together to address the technicalities of a global identity system. And, while there are significant technical, privacy and other challenges, the initiative is making great progress. However, such a service requires resources and the system must be supported financially by the community.</p><h3 id="8-what-is-your-thinking-with-regards-to-automatically-assigning-unique-author-identifiers-to-papers-vs-authors-claiming-their-publications">8. What is your thinking with regards to automatically assigning unique author identifiers to papers vs. authors claiming their publications?</h3><p>I see these as being two complementary and important services. Algorithmic clustering of papers is a common feature in many applications including the <em><em>Web of Science</em></em> and other bibliographic databases. For the most part, these clustering systems do a good job identifying a high percentage of papers for a particular author. However, because none of the industry’s algorithms are perfect, a claiming system that enables the researcher to associate all of their papers is an ideal complement and helps to complete a career profile of a researcher’s works.</p><h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-thomson-reuters">9. What are your responsibilities at Thomson Reuters?</h3><p>My title is Director of eResearch Services. Some of my responsibilities include individual identity initiatives (ResearcherID and the Web of Science Distinct Author Sets clustering system), Web of Knowledge web services, inbound and outbound linking, current awareness and alerting systems, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.projectcounter.org/about.html">COUNTER</a> compliant usage reporting systems.</p><h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-working-at-thomson-reuters">10. What did you do before working at Thomson Reuters?</h3><p>Prior to joining Thomson Reuters in 1997 I worked for the Datapro division of McGraw Hill in product development and for Xerox selling document management systems.</p>]]></content>

Peer review is done in many different ways, and has dramatically changed in the last 25 years. But the purpose of peer review is still to improve the quality of research by providing feedback, and to evaluate the quality of research. The evaluation serves as a filter both for limited resources (e.g. grants or jobs; publication in a journal is no longer a limited resource), and for other researchers to focus on the most relevant work in their field.</p><p>It is therefore surprising that relatively little research on peer review itself has been done. Most discussions focus on the shortcomings of peer review, and the arguments are often based on personal experience and/or interests. Good research on peer review can help to improve the peer review process. Last week such a paper was published in <em><em>PLoS ONE.</em></em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/3157621454_902378aa2f.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="500"><figcaption>Flickr image by Gideon Burton.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><strong>Richard Kravitz</strong></strong> and colleagues looked at the recommendations of peer reviewers, and how they influenced the editorial decision to publish or reject a paper. The study looked at 6213 manuscripts received 2004-2008 at the <em><em>Journal of General Internal Medicine (JGIM)</em></em> where four of the authors were either current or former editors in chief.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/pone.0010072.g001.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2292" height="3101"><figcaption>Figure 1. Flow chart showing outcome of reviews pertaining to 2264 manuscripts undergoing external peer review at the <em><em>Journal of General Internal Medicine</em></em>.</figcaption></figure><p>At <em><em>JGIM</em></em> submitted manuscripts were first screened by an editor in chief and a deputy editor. Most manuscripts were rejected at this step, 2264 manuscripts (36%) were sent out for peer review. 2916 reviewers wrote a total of 5581 reviews (1-4 per manuscript) which included comments and a recommendation. Eventually 43% of the manuscripts were accepted for publication.</p><p>Overall, there was agreement between all reviewers in just over half of the manuscripts (54.6% ), furthermore editors did not follow these recommendations in another 10% of manuscripts:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/pone.0010072.t001.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="4109" height="793"><figcaption><strong>Table 1. </strong>Likelihood of Initial Decision to Reject in Relation to Reviewer Agreement.</figcaption></figure><p>The inter-reviewer agreement was slightly higher than what would have been expected by chance, and was lower than the agreement between recommendations for several manuscripts by the same reviewer. In contrast, there was little correlation between editorial decisions for different manuscripts handled by the same editor.</p><p>The authors write in the discussion:</p><p><em><em>If reviewers cannot regularly agree on whether to recommend rejection or further consideration, the marginal contribution of such summative recommendations may be small, and worse, they may distract from reviewers' primary contribution, which is to improve the reporting – and ultimately the performance – of science.</em></em></p><p>The paper authors consider the following to improve reviewer recommendations: using more reviewers per manuscript, providing better training for reviewers, or recommendations could be dropped altogether and reviewers asked to focus instead on evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of manuscripts. Some journals are obviously using this latter approach.</p><p>Several studies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094155/http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000254668.63378.32">have shown</a> that most rejected manuscripts will eventually be published somewhere else. One important reason is that publication space in journals is no longer a scarcity as it was before electronic publishing became widespread. This means that the ultimate decision whether or not something will be published in a peer-reviewed journal rests with the authors and not the editors or reviewers. Reviewers should keep this in mind.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Kravitz, R., Franks, P., Feldman, M., Gerrity, M., Byrne, C., &amp; Tierney, W. (2010).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Wednesday I attended the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.hcsmeucamp.com/">Health Care Social Media Camp</a> in Berlin. Healthcare Social Media in Europe – <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> for short – is a community of healthcare twitterers and social media users from Europe, started in August 2009 by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.whydotpharma.com/about/">Silja Chouquet</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://stwem.com/">Andrew Spong</a>. I am interested in <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> not only because I am a physician treating cancer patients, but also because there is a lot of overlap to many other things that interest me in doing and communicating science online, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances-and-problems-of-doing-science-online">doing clinical research with online tools</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/03/22/cancer-and-the-media">reporting about cancer in the media</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/01/16/scienceonline09-providing-public-health-and-medical-information-to-all">better access to public health and medical information</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4482350267_c1105c6103.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>Me listening to Andrew starting off the meeting. #hcsmeucamp Twitter feed in background. Flickr photo by dikomci.</em></em></p><p>The meeting was a small gathering of about 45 people in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">unconference</a> format, so we started with collecting questions we wanted to discuss during the day. For each of the four sessions (patient perspective, health care professional perspective, pharma perspective and <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> mission and goals) we first split up in 3-4 smaller groups to talk about some of the questions, and in the second half summarized and discussed this as the whole group. Some participants demonstrated excellent skills with the whiteboard.</p><p><em><em>How do we get scientists interested in social media?</em></em> is something we have talked about many times, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/10/19/scientists-still-not-joining-social-networks/">Scientists Still Not Joining Social Networks</a>. Healthcare professionals are also reluctant to use social media, and we come up with some interesting suggestions to do something about this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4483005134_dfea7e66ba_d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>Flickr photo by dikomci.</em></em></p><p>We also talked about the dangers of getting involved with social media. The doctor-patient communication is something that is difficult to translate from personal communication to social media (lawyers and some other professions have similar problems), but otherwise the dangers look familiar to many scientists:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4483004296_b2ba2d7482_d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p><em><em>Flickr photo by dikomci.</em></em></p><p>The last part of the meeting was about <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em>, and what next steps to take. <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> is very focused on moving the agenda forward, and that spirit penetrated the whole meeting. After a very productive discussion we come up with some good action items:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4482357507_121d7b3c86.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Flickr photo by dikomci.</figcaption></figure><p><em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> is very much built around Twitter, including regular Tweetups every Friday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23hcsmeucamp">heavy use</a> during the meeting. I am a big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.twitter.com/mfenner">Twitter fan</a>, but have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/17/scienceonline2010-i-wish-i-was-there">argued before</a> that Twitter is not the best tool for conference microblogging, as it is difficult to have connected discussions around a topic, and archieving is complicated. And pictures, documents and links are better collected in places like <em><em>Flickr</em></em>, <em><em>Slideshare</em></em> and <em><em>delicious</em></em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://mfenner.posterous.com/best-practices-for-hcsmeu-social-media-use">My suggestions</a> for the <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> knowledge hub therefore include more use of other social media tools, plus <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> or a similar aggregation/microblogging tool to connect all the social media in one place. <em><em>Facebook</em></em> is actually a perfect tool to do all this, but unfortunately is still perceived by many as a tool for <em><em>private</em></em> social networking. I met many very smart and friendly people during the meeting and hope to hear more about <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> at <em><em>Science Online London 2010</em></em> in September or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.medicine20congress.com/ocs/index.php/med/med2010">Medicine 2.0 conference</a> in November.</p>]]></content>

She argues that the current systems of measurement are inadequate, as they have several inherent problems and do not capture the full spectrum of scientific activities. Good scientific metrics are difficult, but without them we risk making the wrong decisions about funding and academic positions.</p><p>Julia Lane suggests that we develop and use standard identifiers both for researchers and their scientific output (examples given include the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> for publications and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> as unique author identifier), that we develop standards for reporting scientific achievements (e.g. using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/rppr/">Research Performance Progress Report</a> format), and that we open up and connect the various tools and databases that collect scientific output. She cites the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://lattes.cnpq.br/english/index.htm">Lattes</a> database for Brasilian researchers as a successful example for systematically collecting scientific output. Another example given is the ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://nrc59.nas.edu/star_info2.cfm">STAR METRICS</a> project which measures the impact of federally funded research on economic, scientific and social outcomes.</p><p>The article emphasizes that is not enough to think about how to best collect and report scientific output, but that it is equally important to understand what these data mean and how to use them, and this may differ from field to field. Knowledge creation is complex and measuring this can not be reduced to counting scientific papers and the number of times they are cited. Social scientists and economists should be involved in this step. Julia Lane suggests an international platform supported by funding agencies in which ideas and potential solutions for science metrics can be discussed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/3592693331_ae8822f91d.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="375"><figcaption>Flickr photo by jepoirrier.</figcaption></figure><p>The article contains a lot of food for thought and has already collected some insightful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/full/464488a.html#comments">comments</a>. In perfect timing, <em><em>Nature</em></em> this week not only made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/naturenews.html">Nature News available without a subscription</a>, but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/464466a">added commenting to all their articles</a>. I would like to add some thoughts on topics that were not covered because of space constraints and different perspective.</p><h3 id="what-are-the-standard-identifiers-for-research-output"><strong><strong>What are the standard identifiers for research output?</strong></strong></h3><p>Using standard identifiers for research output is an essential first step, and the standard identifier for scientific papers is the DOI. So why is it that PubMed (the most important database for biomedical articles, published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health) still uses their own PMID and doesn't display the DOI in their abstract and summary views? And where is the DOI in abstracts, full-text HTML or PDF of articles published in the New England Journal of Medicine, to take just one popular medical journal as an example? Both PubMed and the NEJM obviously use the DOI, but why do they make it so difficult for others?</p><p>The unique author identifier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> was mentioned in the article (disclaimer: I am a member of the ORCID technical working group). There are many other initiatives for uniquely identifying researchers, most of them older than <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> which was started in November 2009. But is very important that we can agree on a single author identifier that is supported by researchers, institutions, journals and funding organizations. <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> already has support from a growing list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.orcid.org/gallery.php">ORCID members</a> and is our best chance for a widely supported and open unique author identifier. But this list of <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> members is very short on funding organizations (with notable exceptions such as the <strong><strong>Wellcome Trust</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>EMBO</strong></strong>). What is holding them back, and that includes the <strong><strong>National Science Foundation</strong></strong> (where Julia Lane works) and the U.S. <strong><strong>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</strong></strong>?</p><p>Persistent identifiers are essential to attribute, cite and share primary research data sets. We have a long tradition for this with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/">sequence data</a>, and there is growing demand in other research areas, especially when huge amounts of data are collected (one example is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.pangaea.de/about/">PANGEA</a> for earth system research). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> is a new initiative that aims to improve the scholarly infrastructure around datasets, and to <em><em>increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scientific record</em></em>.</p><p>With the focus on research papers, we forget that we do not have standard identifiers for many aspects of scientific activity, including</p><ul><li>research grants</li><li>principal investigator in clinical trials</li><li>scientific prizes and awards</li><li>invited lectures</li><li>curation of scientific databases</li><li>mentoring of students</li></ul><h3 id="how-do-we-measure-scientific-output">How do we measure scientific output?</h3><p>Citations are the traditional way to measure the impact of a scientific paper. Some of the problems with this approach are well-known and were for example highlighted in a 2007 editorial in the <em><em>Journal of Cell Biology</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200711140">Show me the data</a>). We need a metric that is open and not proprietary, and that measures the citations of an individual paper and not the journal as a whole. We should also not forget that the number of citations can't be compared between different fields.</p><p>A 2009 analysis by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.mesur.org/">MESUR</a> project indicates that scientific impact of a paper can not be measured by any single indicator (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022">A Principal Component Analysis of 39 Scientific Impact Measures</a>). Alternatives to citations are usage statistics such as HTML page views and PDF downloads, popularity in social bookmarking sites, coverage in blog posts, and comments to articles. The <em><em>PLoS</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">article level metrics</a> introduced in September 2009 combine these different metrics, and make the data openly available.</p><p>How best to measure the other aspects of scientific output is largely unknown. It is possible to count the number of research grants or the total amount of money awarded, but should we simply count the number of submitted research datasets, invited lectures, science blog posts, etc., or do we need some quality indicator similar to citations?</p><h3 id="why-do-we-need-all-this"><strong><strong>Why do we need all this?</strong></strong></h3><p>Julia Lane emphasizes that we need science metrics to make the right decisions about funding and academic positions. And I fully agree with her that we need more research by social scientists and economists to better understand what these data mean and how best to use them. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that suggests that science metrics alone may be poor indicators of future scientific achievements, simply because there are too many confounding factors. Maybe we also need to find a better term, as metric implies that scientific output can be reduced to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://friendfeed.com/jcbradley/18e76233/binfield-article-level-metrics-should-be">one or more numbers</a>.</p><p>Another important motivation for improving science metrics, and not mentioned in the article, is to reduce the burden on researchers and administrators in evaluating research. The proportion of time spent doing research vs. time spent applying for funding, submitting manuscripts, filling out evaluation forms, doing peer review, etc. has become ridiculous for many active scientists. Initiatives such as the standardized <strong><strong>Research Performance Progress Report</strong></strong> format mentioned in the paper or automated tools to created a publication list or CV can reduce this burden. Funding organizations are also trying to reduce the burden of evaluating research , e.g. by increasing the time of funding from 3 to 5 years, reducing the number of papers that can be listed in grant applications (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/03/01/german-research-foundation-says-that-numbers-arent-everything">German Research Foundation says that numbers aren't everything</a>), or funding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/investigator-awards/Implementation/index.htm">investigators and not projects</a>.</p><p>Science metrics are not only important for evaluating scientific output, they are also great discovery tools, and this may indeed be their more important use. Traditional ways of discovering science (e.g. keyword searches in bibliographic databases) are increasingly superseded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/22/there-is-still-so-much-to-learn-in-reference-management">non-traditional approaches</a> that use social networking tools for awareness, evaluations and popularity measurements of research findings.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Lane, J.

Only 13% of articles reported that aggressive treatment might fail to cure or extend life, and only 30% of articles mentioned that cancer treatments can result in (sometimes serious) adverse events.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654im_/http://farm1.static.flickr.com/4/7942175_28dd6be677_o_d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Flickr image by Andraia.</figcaption></figure><p>Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States and therefore cancer news coverage is relevant to many people. One important finding of the study is the relative under-reporting of death and dying and palliative care, despite the well-documented benefits for patients and their families. The <strong><strong>Pallimed</strong></strong> blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654/http://www.pallimed.org/2010/03/cancer-reporting-in-media-guess-what.html">discusses this</a> in more detail.

In my personal experience as a doctor treating cancer patients, most patients, relatives and their treating physicians (including myself) are overly optimistic about the potential benefits of an aggressive cancer treatment (especially if part of a clinical trial), and talk much less about the possibility of the treatment not working, side effects, or death and dying. The scientific literature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654/http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2008.17.2221">supports this personal experience</a>.</p><p>The study raises a number of additional questions:</p><ul><li>What scientific information was used as background information for the news reports? Conference reports vs. published papers, case reports vs. large randomized trials, research in animal models vs. clinical research? Was a source for the research provided in the news reports?</li><li>What is the cancer news coverage by science/medical bloggers? Is there a similar bias towards aggressive treatment approaches and an under-reporting of treatment failures and adverse events?</li><li>Are there geographical differences (U.S. vs. Europe, urban vs. rural areas) in cancer news reporting and changes over time?</li><li>How are other areas of science covered in the media, e.g. other common diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease or malaria, climate research or other reasearch areas with large public interest, or basic science research?</li></ul><p><em><em>Thanks to <strong><strong>Ivan Oransky</strong></strong> and his <strong><strong>Embargo Watch</strong></strong> blog to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654/http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/are-these-embargo-breaks/">alert</a> me to this paper.</em></em></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Fishman J, Ten Have T, &amp; Casarett D (2010).

In another discussion <em><em>Thomas S</em>ö<em>derquist</em></em> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.corporeality.net/museion/">Medical Museion in Copenhagen</a> reminded me that there are limitations of what can be done online. My blog focusses on talking about science rather than doing science, but this post is about doing science online. My research focusses on clinical cancer research, and in this field the advantages and limitations of doing science online are obviously different from other subject areas (bioinformatics for example obviously looks very different). It probably makes sense to ask yourself the following questions:</p><ul><li>Are your research data collected in (or easily converted into) digital form?</li><li>Are standard data formats and standard tools (preferably as open source software) available?</li><li>Do you regularly collaborate with scientists in other locations?</li><li>Is information about ongoing research projects publicly available?</li><li>Do journals have policies regarding the publication of your primary research data?</li><li>Are there objections to make the research data freely available?</li></ul><h3 id="are-your-research-data-collected-in-or-easily-converted-into-digital-form">Are your research data collected in (or easily converted into) digital form</h3><p>Electronic medical records (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record">EMR</a>) have the potential to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01unbox.html">improve patient care and reduce costs</a>. But for now, often only some clinical information (particularly lab and radiology results) is available electronically and paper-based patient records are still commonly used. And both electronic and paper-based records have to be adapted to be useful for clinical research, e.g. by allowing a detailed documentation of adverse events.</p><p>The raw clinical data of a patient in a trial (called <em><em>source data</em></em> in clinical research) are entered into a case-report form (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report_form">CRF</a>). The purpose of this two-step process is to make sure that all required data are collected and that they are entered correctly. Many clinical trials now use electronic CRFs or electronic data capture (EDC). But these tools are still surprisingly difficult to use and more expensive than paper-based solutions, so that many trials stick to paper CRFs and enter the data into a computer at a later stage. It also doesn't help that the EDC market is very fragmented, so that institutions have to learn to use several different tools.</p><h3 id="are-standard-data-formats-and-standard-tools-preferably-as-open-source-software-available">Are standard data formats and standard tools (preferably as open source software) available?</h3><p>Clinical Data Interchange Standard (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.cdisc.org/">CDISC</a>) is the standard format for clinical research data. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.openclinica.org/">OpenClinica</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/CTMS/?pid=primary.2006-10-24.9768040952&amp;sid=ctmsws&amp;status=True">Clinical Trials Management System of CaBIG</a> are two examples of Open Source tools for clinical research.</p><h3 id="do-you-regularly-collaborate-with-scientists-in-other-locations">Do you regularly collaborate with scientists in other locations?</h3><p>Most clinical trials are multi-center trials that are conducted in different locations, often even in different countries or continents. The coordination of the different trial locations uses email and web conferencing, but often relies more on human resources than on modern Web 2.0 tools.</p><h3 id="is-information-about-ongoing-research-projects-publicly-available">Is information about ongoing research projects publicly available?</h3><p>Clinical research is one of only a few research areas where information about (almost) all ongoing research project is publicly available. Clinical trial registries serve two purposes. They make it much easier for patients and their treating physicians to find relevant clinical trials. And they allow clinical researchers to understand what clinical research is going on in their field, and to avoid publication bias. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> at the US National Institutes of Health is the largest clinical trial registry. For reasons that are difficult to understand, the European Clinical Trials database (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/https://eudract.emea.europa.eu/">EudraCT</a>) is not available to the public, but work is in progress to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.ecpc-online.org/component/docman/doc_download/68-ecpc-comments-on-qconsultation-for-data-fields-from-eudract-made-available-on-eudrapharmq.html?ItemId=127">change</a> that.</p><h3 id="do-journals-have-policies-regarding-the-publication-of-your-primary-research-data">Do journals have policies regarding the publication of your primary research data?</h3><p>An article in the <em><em>BMJ</em></em> last month by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz and colleagues<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances_and_problems_of_doing_science_online/#fn1">1</a></sup> tries to provide guidance on how to provide raw clinical data for publication. The main focus of the paper is patient privacy. Publication of raw clinical data either as dataset or as part of a research paper is still very uncommon. The meta-analysis of individual patient data<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances_and_problems_of_doing_science_online/#fn2">2</a></sup> requires the raw clinical data of several clinical trials, and because of the required effort is probably underused.</p><h3 id="are-there-objections-to-make-the-research-data-freely-available">Are there objections to make the research data freely available?</h3><p>Patient privacy is a major concern when publishing raw clinical data, and it's therefore critical to remove all identifying information from the dataset. This not only includes <em><em>direct identifiers</em></em> such as patient names, birthdates, unique identifying numbers or facial photographs, but also <em><em>indirect identifers</em></em> such as place of treatment, rare disease or treatment, occupation or place of work, etc. It is the consensus of the authors of the <em><em>BMJ</em></em> paper that datasets with three or more indirect identifiers should be evaluated for the risk that individuals might be identifiable before they are made available,</p><p>In contrast to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/">Open Notebook Science</a>, it is impossible to make the results of a clinical trial publicly available before the trial is completed. The statistical design of the clinical trial is based on the number of patients needed to show a significant difference – looking at interim data could influence patient recruitment. Double-blind designs (where neither patient nor treating physician now which treatment arm the patient is in) are based on the same principle.</p><p>In clinical research there is often more at stake than the well-being of patients and the careers of the scientists involved. <em><em>Pfizer</em></em> and <em><em>Roche</em></em> last week each lost $1 billion in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abbott-pfizer-lead-drug-stocks-lower-2010-03-12">stock market value</a> after they both announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.pharmastrategyblog.com/2010/03/more-phase-iii-cancer-trials-flop-pfizer-sutent-and-roche-avastin.html">negative results of large phase III cancer trials</a>. Drug companies therefore have a great interest in whether and when research findings are published, and that includes the raw clinical data. The selective publication of positive research findings is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/11/18/publication-bias-in-clinical-trials">publication bias</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">mandatory reporting of clinical trial results in ClinicalTrials.gov</a> was introduced by the FDA to reduce publication bias.</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>Online tools can help with doing clinical research and there is probably a lot of untapped potential. From the perspective of an individual researcher or a small research group, it probably makes the most sense to develop and/or use tools that solve specific problems. I use the online project management tool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> to coordinate one clinical research project. And I have created a web-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/">clinical trials registry</a> for our university hospital. The internet version of this registry helps patients and referring physicians to find clinical trials at our institution. The intranet version helps us manage our clinical trials, e.g. by keeping all required documents in one place, keeping track of the patients registered in clinical trials, and serious adverse event reporting. And I don't see why clinical researchers can't adopt the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://pantonprinciples.org/">Panton Principles</a> – which endorse that data related to published science should be explicitly placed in the public domain – whenever possible.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><em><em>Hrynaszkiewicz et al</em></em>.

He and his colleagues are interested in how researchers find and use information, and how this has changed with the internet, especially for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/resourcediscovery/googlegen.aspx">Google Generation</a> (people born after 1993).

The findings of the first part of the project were presented and discussed in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.rin.ac.uk/news/events/e-journals-revolution-how-use-scholarly-journals-shaping-research">workshop last July</a>.

The findings were summarized in a paper also published last July: <strong><strong>Online use and information seeking behaviour: institutional and subject comparisons of UK researchers</strong></strong>.</p><p>In the paper, the use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.oxfordjournals.org/">Oxford Journals</a> by 10 major UK research institutions was analyzed in the fields of life sciences, economics and history, using the server logs for the full year 2007. Some of the key findings of the study include:</p><h3 id="one-third-of-users-access-oxford-journals-outside-business-hours">One third of users access Oxford Journals outside business hours</h3><p>9.7% of uses happened on a Saturday/Sunday and 30.1% between 6 PM and 9 AM. This means that about one third of users accessed Oxford Journals outside typical business hours, either working late or from home (the study didn't distinguish between these two). These numbers indicate that remote access (from home, but probably also when traveling) is important for many users. This is obviously not an issue for Open Access journals, but institutions need to provide practical solutions (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a>, etc.) for subscription journals. From personal experience this remote access is still overly complicated. And these numbers also mean that librarians will not be available for support questions one third of the time.</p><h3 id="around-40-of-sessions-originated-from-a-google-search">Around 40% of sessions originated from a Google Search</h3><p>In 2004 Oxford Journals opened up to Google for indexing. I didn't expect this important role that Google seems to play in finding scholarly papers, and I would be very interested in feedback from blog readers. Only 4% of sessions originated from Google Scholar (22% in economics). These results probably explain why Google Scholar hasn't seen that much development since it was launched. The search function at Oxford Journals was rarely used.</p><p>43% of users of history journals, but only 16% of users of life sciences journals used navigational tools (table of contents, etc.) provided by the journal. This statistic obviously doesn't look at users getting the table of contents via email or RSS, but it again shows that access via search now probably is more common than via browsing.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/08/evaluating_usage_patterns_of_online_journals/#fn1">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="most-users-spend-little-time-on-journal-webpages-but-return-often">Most users spend little time on journal webpages, but return often</h3><p>The average number of articles viewed per session was 1.1, and the average session time was just over 4 minutes. Users rather return often, usually via a search. These numbers indicate that journal webpages are not a place where users spend a lot of time. Unless journals change this (e.g. by more active involvement of users via comments and other social networking features, etc.), they probably can't expect to generate significant revenue from online advertising. The internet has not only dramatically changed the role of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists-and-librarians-friend-or-foe">libraries</a>, but also for journals, as users are mostly interested in single articles, rather than the journal as a whole.</p><h3 id="the-median-age-of-articles-was-48-months-life-sciences-73-months-economics-and-90-months-history-">The median age of articles was 48 months (life sciences), 73 months (economics), and 90 months (history)</h3><p>In the life sciences only 25% of the articles were no more than 16 months old, but another 25% were over 104 months old.

But maybe Journal publishers should stop displaying papers in an abstract view, saving users and themselves some effort. <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals don't have an abstract view, but the <em><em>Biomed Central</em></em> journals (which are also Open Access) do.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Tuesday the <em><em>German Research Foundation</em></em> (DFG) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.dfg.de/en/service/press/press_releases/2010/pressemitteilung_nr_07/index.html">announced</a> changes to the grant application process, going in effect in July. Researchers are no longer allowed to list all their publications in their grant proposals. The number of publications is limited to five per researcher and to two per year of planned funding (e.g. 6 papers for a 3-year grant). Publications submitted but not yet accepted for publication will no longer be allowed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/76463757_24a1858d2e_m.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="240" height="240"><figcaption>Flickr image by CarbonNYC.</figcaption></figure><p>Some of the reasoning behind this change was explained in the press conference where the policy change was announced. The DFG wants to put more emphasis on quality instead of quantity, in other words counteract the trend to publish several small pieces of incremental research findings (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/01/repost_thoughts_on_the_least_p.php">least publishable unit</a> or <em><em>LPU</em></em>). The DFG didn't say so, but this might also reduce the practice of “honorary coauthorship” with some researchers being coauthors of 20 or even 50 papers per year. And the DFG is not happy with the increasing use of the Journal Impact Factor and other metrics as a token measure for the quality of research output. And as a reaction to problems with publication lists in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,622474,00.html">G&amp;Atilde;¶ttingen</a> they want to stop the practice of including unpublished work in reference lists for grant applications.</p><p>These changes will decrease the administrative workload of the applicant, reviewer and the DFG. With much shorter reference lists in grant applications, reviewers will have it much easier to take a closer look at the research output of the applicant, instead of relying on an unfortunate proxy such as the <em><em>Journal Impact Factor</em></em>. Researchers seeking funding from the DFG will now probably be more likely to write fewer but more substantial papers. And research that doesn't have the potential for a substantial paper, but is nevertheless worth publishing, can be quickly published in a reasonable journal instead of going through several rounds of submissions to a number of journals.</p><p>But how do you select your five best publications (assuming you have written more than five)? Choices include:</p><ul><li>publication date, e.g. a list of the five most recent publications</li><li>Journal Impact Factor</li><li>citation counts, page views, downloads or other article-level metrics</li><li>personal preference</li></ul><p>Using my personal preference (and not too much thought), I picked four papers and one correspondence:</p><ul><li><em><em>Shioda T, Fenner MH, Isselbacher KJ</em></em> Msg1, a novel melanocyte-specific gene, encodes a nuclear protein and is associated with pigmentation. <em><em>PNAS</em></em> 1996 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC37985/?tool=pubmed">PubMed Central</a><br>The first paper from my postdoctoral research project. We identified and cloned a new gene thought to be involved in cancer metastasis, using a technology called differential display to compare the gene expression profile of two melanoma cell lines. This was before the mouse and human genomes were sequenced, and before microarrays became available. What took us two years of work 15 years ago can now probably be done in a few weeks.</li><li><em><em>Sado T, Fenner MH, Tan SS Tam P, Shioda T, Li E</em></em> X Inactivation in the Mouse Embryo Deficient for Dnmt1: Distinct Effect of Hypomethylation on Imprinted and Random X Inactivation. <em><em>Dev Biol</em></em> 2000 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/dbio.2000.9823">doi:10.1006/dbio.2000.9823</a><br>I spent most of my time as a post-doc generating a knockout mouse for the gene identified in the previous paper. As the knockout mouse had no obvious phenotype, it took another post-doc (the first author) to finish the project.</li><li><em><em>Krege S et al.</em></em> European consensus conference on diagnosis and treatment of germ cell cancer: a report of the second meeting of the European Germ Cell Cancer Consensus group (EGCCCG): part I. <em><em>Eur Urol</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2007.12.024">doi:10.1016/j.eururo.2007.12.024</a><br>This paper summarizes the conclusions of a consensus conference on the diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer, and is the best review on the subject.

Starting later this year, they will stop accepting proposals for project grants, and rather evaluate the reaseach output of the scientist asking for funding (<em><em>Investigator Awards</em></em>). They argue that researchers that alrady have shown excellence in the past shoudn't be burdened with the administrative overhead and restrictions of writing a detailed project proposal every three years.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how institutions and other research funders in Germany (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.helmholtz.de/en/">Helmholtz</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.wgl.de/">Leibniz</a>) or elsewhere react to this DFG policy change. I would be happy if this is a step towards more reasonable publication policies. And I hope that the upcoming unique author identifier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> will not be used for even more complicated bibliometric calculations, but rather as a tool for researchers to showcase their most interesting work.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://wikify.org/">Lambert Heller</a> and myself did a two-day workshop <em><em>Reference Management in Times of Web 2.0</em></em> for a group of German librarians. We introduced and tested the following five programs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a></li></ul><p>The goal of the workshop was to introduce the participants to the Web 2.0 aspects of these reference managers. We briefly talked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers">Papers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citavi.com/">Citavi</a>, but neither of them offers any Web 2.0 functionality. The goal of the workshop was <em><em>not</em></em> to pick the best reference manager. With the exception of <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> (which is more of a social bookmarking service and can't be used to directly put references into manuscripts), all of them are probably good choices for most users. For some of the minor differences, please check my reference manager chart that I have updated for the workshop (PDF <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.slideshare.net/mfenner/reference-manager-overview-2-1-3250074">here</a>):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/Reference Manager Overview 2.3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1240" height="1755"></figure><p>We had used FriendFeed for the slides, links and comments in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://friendfeed.com/bibman2">similar workshop last July</a>. This time we picked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.sciencefeed.com/">ScienceFeed</a>, both because ScienceFeed can be used for reference management, and to test the service that launched just three days earlier. The ScienceFeed group can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.sciencefeed.com/zblit2">here</a>, but is in German. FriendFeed and ScienceFeed are not only great for conference microblogging, but are also excellent teaching tools, especially in a workshop where every participant has an internet-connected computer. We also had a few people listening in and putting up comments.</p><p>The workshop did help me understand what could become one of the most important features of reference managers. (I would exclude <em><em>Endnote</em></em>, because it doesn't allow public groups or sharing of fulltext files). Libraries used to be places where you could find, store and read literature. A library would hold a subset of all the available literature, but still far more texts than an individual could keep at his home. A library serves as an intermediary that helps the user get access to the literature he is interested in.</p><p>A reference manager that stores all references and the associated fulltext PDF files in an accessible (public or password-protected) place can fullfill exactly the same role. It is not necessary that an individual user stores every reference and fulltext paper on his own computer. And he doesn't have to find all references for himself. Librarians could help with this, e.g. by not only handling a users search request, but also filing the associated PDF files in a group folder. Other group folders would have the table of contents of your favorite journals (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citeulike.org/journals">CiteULike Journals</a>). We used to go to the library for exactly these things. And now we do this all on our own, often not asking for help from our local library.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209im_/http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3047/2587796561_36fea74569.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Flickr photo by haydnseek.</figcaption></figure><p>In the last session I talked about non-traditional ways to find scientific literature.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microblogging is blogging of short text messages, photos or other media and is best exemplified by <em><em>Twitter</em></em>. Twitter use has grown tremendously in 2009, and this also includes many scientists.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/02/15/sciencefeed_interview_with_ijad_madisch/#fn1">1</a></sup> <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> is a another microblogging tool that not only allows sending of short text messages, but connects them together in groups and discussions threads similar to what you can do in online forums. FriendFeed, especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://friendfeed.com/the-life-scientists">The Life Scientists</a> group has been a popular place for many scientists for the last 18 months or so. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile">Cameron Neylon</a> wrote a good introduction to the service back in June 2008: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/06/12/friendfeed-for-scientists-what-why-and-how/">FriendFeed for scientists: what, why, and how?</a>. FriendFeed is a great tool for conference blogging, and the ISBM 2008 conference was probably the first scientific conference where it was used extensively, resulting in a <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> paper.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/02/15/sciencefeed_interview_with_ijad_madisch/#fn2">2</a></sup> FriendFeed is also often used to comment on blog posts, and here it is competing for attention with comments that are put directly on a blog. FriendFeed is a good example for a generic Web 2.0 tool that is much more useful to scientists than many Web 2.0 tools targeted specifically at scientists (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://fcw.com/Articles/2009/10/26/NIH-grant-creates-Facebook-for-Scientists.aspx">Facebooks for scientists</a>).</p><p>FriendFeed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=116581">was acquired by Facebook</a> in August 2009, and users started to worry about the long-term future of FriendFeed. An Open Source version of the FriendFeed web server was recently released as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://bret.appspot.com/entry/tornado-web-server">Tornado</a> (source code on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://github.com/facebook/tornado">GitHub</a>). Although other services (including <em><em>Facebook</em></em>) offer similar functionality, no service has (yet) emerged as an alternative popular with scientists. FriendFeed use seemed to be declining at the two recent <em><em>Science Online London 2009</em></em> and <em><em>ScienceOnline2010</em></em> conferences, as more and more people were using Twitter.</p><p>Last Tuesday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.google.com/buzz">Google Buzz</a> was released. <em><em>Buzz</em></em> is also a microblogging service, tightly integrated with <em><em>Google Mail</em></em> and <em><em>Google Reader</em></em>. If offers many of the same features as <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, and because it integrates with Google Mail, it has a large number of potential users from the start – including a large number of people involved in the Science Bloggosphere. <em><em>Buzz</em></em> will certainly get some of the features that are still missing, e.g. an easy way to import content from other sources, including a bookmarklet. And <em><em>Buzz</em></em> works very well on iPhone and Android phones and there also uses location information – e.g. all the <em><em>Buzz</em></em> discussions near you. But at the moment many people wonder how best to integrate <em><em>Buzz</em></em> with <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> and <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, and all the other online tools they use – it doesn't make sense to read the same content again and again on all these services.</p><p>In this context it is very interesting to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.sciencefeed.com/">ScienceFeed</a> launching as a new microblogging service this week. <em><em>ScienceFeed</em></em> in many ways is similar to <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, but tries to add features of particular interest to scientists. I spoke with <em><em>Ijad Madisch</em></em> about ScienceFeed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/ijad_madisch/web.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="1-what-is-sciencefeed">1. What is ScienceFeed?</h3><p>ScienceFeed is science as it happens, communicated through a microblogging platform. Conceptualized and designed by scientists, it is a bridge between online scientific networking platforms, scientific databases, and the wider online science community. The ScienceFeed platform allows users to post microblogs, sometimes just a few sentences, on scientific headlines, new findings, controversy, conferences and ideas related to science. Community members can follow the feeds of fellow members and comment on topics in which they are interested, allowing real-time communication and transfer of ideas.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/sciencefeed_screenshot/web.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>ScienceFeed is an interactive and dynamic platform – like science itself. Here, scientists, journalists, librarians, students, and those with an interest in science, will be able to communicate in a way that has no borders. Individuals from all over the world are able to participate and observe, helping to make science accessible to all. Integral to the concept of Science 2.0 is having online resources that are archivable and searchable – ScienceFeed will do just this. Science is not limited to the laboratory: it happens through interactions of communities. ScienceFeed is excited to build such a community.</p><h3 id="2-how-is-sciencefeed-different-from-friendfeed">2. How is ScienceFeed different from FriendFeed?</h3><p>In basic functionality, ScienceFeed isn't much different to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://friendfeed.com/the-life-scientists">FriendFeed</a>. However, I think with the help of the community we will develop and add applications to the platform that could make it very efficient for scientific communication. There are two differences from FriendFeed which we have already implemented: 1) Specific scientific publications can easily be searched for and then entered as a linked-in reference within a feed, and, 2) Groups can be marked as an event (e.g. a conference). My vision is to have event streams in ScienceFeed, which then can be visualized and presented in a much better way. However, the most important part is that we listen to the feedback of the community and develop specific applications based on their ideas and feedback.</p><h3 id="3-what-special-features-does-sciencefeed-provide-for-conference-microblogging">3. What special features does ScienceFeed provide for conference microblogging</h3><p>An important feature from ScienceFeed is that groups can be marked as a specific event, such as a conference. Administrators of these groups will be able to import hashtags from Twitter, so all tweets will be aggregated and displayed within this group. A possibility for future growth is the integration of an entire conference program (sessions, panels, etc.) into the group, which then can be commented on by group members. It is important to us that the scientific community has an input into the development of this feature so that we can build a stronger, more efficient platform based on the needs of our users.</p><h3 id="4-can-you-import-references-into-sciencefeed-only-via-your-reference-database-or-also-via-citeulike-or-other-bookmarking-service">4. Can you import references into ScienceFeed only via your reference database, or also via CiteULike or other bookmarking service?</h3><p>Martin, thank you so much for this great idea. Based on your feedback we worked hard to make this happen before launch. Yes, now ScienceFeed can import from other bookmarking services such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteUlike</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>. Furthermore ScienceFeed supports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.oclc.org/productworks/coins.htm">CoiNS</a>, which identifies automatically based on a weblink whether or not bibliographic data is in the specified URL.</p><h3 id="5-how-is-sciencefeed-different-from-twitter">5. How is ScienceFeed different from Twitter?</h3><p>There are several differences, but the largest are that in ScienceFeed there is no character limitation and groups can be tagged as a specific event – facilitating real-time, online communication about the event.</p><h3 id="6-what-is-the-advantage-of-having-a-social-networking-tool-specifically-for-scientists">6. What is the advantage of having a social networking tool specifically for scientists?</h3><p>I think the most important part is the non-dilution of information in an environment where the platform and focus is specifically on science. Consider the following: You can find a biomedical scientific paper by searching in Google, but you could also use PubMed, which has a high probability of faster and better results. It is the same as within <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGATE</a>: You have large groups (Methods, Immunology, Neuroscience, Philosophy, etc.) with a very focused population, which again makes your search more directed and efficient with better results.</p><h3 id="7-what-is-the-relationship-between-sciencefeed-and-researchgate">7. What is the relationship between ScienceFeed and ResearchGATE?</h3><p>ScienceFeed will be a scientific microblogging platform completely autonomous from ResearchGATE, because I think they target the same group, but with various usage patterns.</p><p>The publication reference tool used for inserting papers into ScienceFeed accesses the custom-built database of ResearchGATE. This database now has a public API which makes it possible for everyone to connect to the ResearchGATE literature database. I think that microarticles which are pretty successful in Researchgate (published in our ResearchBLOG) could be a part of ScienceFeed as well. I see ScienceFeed as a platform which will be useful to various scientific platforms as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.academia.edu/">Academia</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGATE</a>, etc. It could be a platform that helps connect all these different platforms.</p><h3 id="8-will-there-be-a-publicly-available-api-for-sciencefeed">8. Will there be a publicly available API for ScienceFeed?</h3><p>Yes, there will be an API.</p><h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-in-sciencefeed">9. What are your responsibilities in ScienceFeed?</h3><p>I am, as in ResearchGATE, one of the co-founders and a kind of CEO. I want to build a team of innovative and forward-thinking individuals to help develop ideas and work conceptually on the future directions of ScienceFeed.</p><h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-working-on-sciencefeed">10. What did you do before working on ScienceFeed?</h3><p>I am a co-founder and CEO of ResearchGATE and I am also working at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, in Boston as a researcher. Before ResearchGATE I studied Medicine and Computer Science and completed my doctoral thesis in Virology, while working for some time in Gastroenterology as a medical doctor.</p><h3 id="11-could-you-provide-contact-information-for-people-that-have-further-questions-about-sciencefeed">11. Could you provide contact information for people that have further questions about ScienceFeed?</h3><p>I can be contacted anytime at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/mailto:ijad.madisch@sciencefeed.com">ijad.madisch@sciencefeed.com</a>.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p><em><em>Bonetta L.</em></em> Should You Be Tweeting? <em><em>Cell</em></em> 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.10.017">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.10.017</a></p><p><em><em>Saunders N et al.</em></em> Microblogging the ISMB: A New Approach to Conference Reporting. <em><em>PLoS Comput Biol</em></em> 2009 https://doi.org/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just four weeks ago I wrote a blog post titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2010/01/10/how-do-you-read-papers-2010-will-be-different">How do you read papers? 2010 will be different</a>. Not only have we since seen the announcement of the Apple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>, but last Monday the free Nature.com iPhone app was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html">launched</a>. The application gives access to the full text of all <em><em>Nature</em></em> and <em><em>Nature News</em></em> content (through until 30 April 2010, how access is handled afterwards hasn't been announced yet). A version for the <em><em>Android</em></em> platform was promised for April, and the app will work with the just-announced <em><em>iPad</em></em>. I included a few screenshots for those without an iPhone or iPod Touch. A free Nature.com personal account is needed to use the app.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0626/web.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>The iPhone app doesn't use HTML or PDF but rather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html">the ePub format</a>. The Nature.com website will soon offer downloads in ePub format (an example article is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/article.epub">here</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">Adobe Digital Editions</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a> are examples of ePub readers.

Digital preservation turned out to be much more difficult than creating digital content, as preservation requires long-term thinking about many issues including file formats, storage solutions and funding. Digital preservation turned out to be too big for individual libraries, publishers or research disciplines, and large collaborative efforts were started in the last five years.</p><h3 id="alliance-for-permanent-access">Alliance for Permanent Access</h3><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.alliancepermanentaccess.eu/">Alliance for Permanent Access</a> is a European strategic framework for digital preservation of scientific information.

Before PDF/A, many organizations (including our institution) used the raster graphics format TIFF. The major advantage of the PDF format is the handling text and vector graphics in addition to raster images, allowing full-text search and smaller file sizes. Because the PDFformat is constantly changing, PDF/A was based on a specific PDF version (1.4) with the following specifications:</p><ul><li>self-contained, no external images or fonts</li><li>no sound or movies</li><li>metadata in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP</a> format</li><li>no password protection</li></ul><p>Most scientific papers are now produced in XML, usually using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM DTD</a>.

How can science libraries persist when scientists haven't the least notion that libraries or librarians are relevant to their work?</blockquote><p>These are serious questions, and of course I don't have the answers. But I would like to add my thoughts from a researcher perspective. The role of libraries in providing teaching material for students (textbooks, etc.) is another story that I will not touch today.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/101350718_fa52fcef35.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="349"><figcaption>Flickr image by Radioher</figcaption></figure><p>I'm old enough to remember the time (maybe 15 years ago) before literature searches were possible via the internet and scientific papers were available in electronic form. I had to go to the library to use Medline or Current Contents in printed form (and later on CD-ROM), or to flip through the newest issues of the most interesting journals. I would photocopy the papers I would then read at home, and then file away for later use.</p><p><em><em>PubMed</em></em>, <em><em>Scopus</em></em>, <em><em>Web of Science</em></em>, and <em><em>Google Scholar</em></em> now allow me to search the literature from my desk at work (or from home). Most researchers (including myself) probably don't have the skills for sophisticated searches, but these tools <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/blog/2008/03/22/i-am-not-yelling-not-out-loud">more or less</a> get the job done. Electronic publishing means that I can obtain a paper directly from the journal (as long as I access the journal from a computer in the university network), and licensing is handled (almost) transparently by the library.</p><p>These developments have dramatically reduced the time researchers spend at a library. This is good, as this saves them a lot time. But interactions between researchers and librarians have also been dramatically reduced. Publishers and other companies (e.g. <em><em>Thomson Reuters</em></em>, <em><em>Mendeley</em></em>, <em><em>Faculty of 1000</em></em>, to name just a few) have used the opportunities to adapt their offerings to the internet (e.g. electronic-only journals), and to create new products that weren't possible (or even thinkable) before. Although libraries have in many ways adapted to the internet as well, they probably haven't seized the opportunity to the same degree. The homepage of my university library is a place I visit much less often than <em><em>PubMed</em></em> or the pages of my favorite journals. Some ideas of how this could be changed are listed below. Most of them are not new, but maybe at least some libraries haven't gone all the way to make their pages an attractive destination for the researchers of their institution.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists_and_librarians_friend_or_foe/#fn1">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="provide-and-support-online-reference-manager">Provide and support online reference manager</h3><p>Institutions should support at least one online reference manager, possible options include (in no particular order) Zotero, Mendeley, Endnote Web, Refworks and CiteULike. RefWorks and Endnote Web are commercial products and require a private (Endnote) and/or institutional license. The institution should either pick a free reference manager as their primary choice, or buy an institutional license in order to allow every researcher and student to use these tools without additional cost.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists_and_librarians_friend_or_foe/#fn2">2</a></p><p>As we can't expect everybody to use the same reference manager, libraries have to help with several products. The easiest way to do so is via an online forum (see next paragraph), as this is more efficient than one-to-one support and allows experienced users to help out. Online reference managers provide additional features (e.g. they can be used from different computers, allow shared folders for groups of users) and should therefore be preferred over standalone applications.</p><h3 id="online-user-training-and-support">Online user training and support</h3><p>User support is obviously one of the central functions of science libraries. This has two aspects: helping with a specific problem (e.g. finding scientific literature), but also training users to do this on their own. The required skills include use of <em><em>PubMed</em></em> and other databases, and reference managers such as <em><em>Endnote</em></em> or <em><em>Zotero</em></em>. Skills in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> are critical to find and appreciate the appropriate medical literature, but in my experience many physicians and medical students would benefit from additional training in this area.</p><p>Introductory classes, help in person or a phone call are sometimes the best way to do this, but often users require quick help for a specific situation that can best done with online tools. Appropriate tools include email, online forum, <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> (a microblogging tool similar to Twitter but for institutions), <em><em>SlideShare</em></em>, <em><em>FaceBook</em></em> (and <em><em>StudiVZ</em></em> in Germany), <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, and Wikis. Every institution should make a decision about the services they plan to support, with emphasis on tools that are easy to use.</p><h3 id="institutional-bibliographies">Institutional bibliographies</h3><p>A regularly updated listing of all publications of an institution is not only a valuable PR service, but is often also required by administrations to evaluate research output. Librarians are often involved in this, but there is probably a lot of untapped potential. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">unique identifiers for researchers</a> become more widespread, there really no longer is a need for researchers to compile publication lists themselves.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists_and_librarians_friend_or_foe/#fn3">3</a></sup></p><h3 id="article-deposition-in-institutional-repositories">Article deposition in institutional repositories</h3><p>Most journals allow researchers to post their accepted papers in institutional repositories of their institution. But because this requires technical skills and extra time, many researchers aren't particularly eager to make use of them. Institutional bibliographies can obviously be nicely integrated with institutional repositories, thus reducing redundant work.</p><h3 id="help-authors-with-article-submissions">Help authors with article submissions</h3><p>Article processing charges for authors are often handled by their libraries, and sometimes libraries have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/libraries/membership">membership deals</a> with publishers that give authors a discount. But researchers often are left alone with the article submission process. Most authors submit at most a handful of papers each year, and they have to deal not only with different article formats between journals (most notably different reference styles), but also different article submission systems (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/25/editorial-manager-interview-with-richard-wynne">Editorial Manager</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://www.ejpress.com/index.shtml">eJournal Press</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://scholarone.com/products/manuscript/">Manuscript Central</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://benchpress.highwire.org/">BenchPress</a>). The total number of papers submitted by an institution is much larger, and thus at least some recurring problems could be avoided or at least the time required reduced with centralized support from the library.</p><h3 id="help-with-web-2-0-tools-for-scientists">Help with Web 2.0 tools for scientists</h3><p>Libraries don't have to reinvent all the Web 2.0 tools for scientists that are already out there, but they are a good place to help interested researchers get started with some of them (e.g. <em><em>ResearchGate</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Network</em></em>, or <em><em>Academia.edu</em></em>). Ideally, these tools could be integrated into the library webpages via an API.</p><p>fn1. I would like to be proven wrong by great examples of libraries gone Web 2.0.</p><p>fn2.

I attended last year and moderated a session called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/01/16/scienceonline09-providing-public-health-and-medical-information-to-all">Providing public health and medical information to all</a>, but unfortunately could not come this year.

For that you need video and microblogging (or the two combined in <em><em>Second Life</em></em>). Video of sessions from two rooms was streamed live at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/scienceonline2010">Ustream</a> and <em><em>Second Life</em></em>, but Ustream didn't always work for me (didn't try Second Life, all sessions were recorded and will appear on <em><em>YouTube</em></em> next week).</p><p>For me and many others <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> is the perfect microblogging tool for conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">Microblogging the ISMB: A New Approach to Conference Reporting</a>). But the use of <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> in Science 2.0 conferences seems on the decline during the last 12 months because of <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, and at <em><em>ScienceOnline2010</em></em> it was no longer possible to follow sessions using <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>. <em><em>Twitter</em></em> is wonderful for many things, but makes it very difficult to create a connected discussion around a particular topic such as a conference session.

We might also find better ways to use <em><em>Twitter</em></em> for microblogging, e.g. by using separate hashtags for every session and a <em><em>Twitter</em></em> board in the sessions.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2010-01-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In November 2008 I wrote a blog post called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/02/how-do-you-read-papers">How do you read papers?</a> The blog post was actually about different strategies to <em><em>find</em></em> interesting papers, e.g. browsing journal tables of content (TOC), different search strategies, filtering by papers others read, or filtering by experts (e.g. <em><em>Faculty of 1000</em></em>). A paper by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/duncan/profile">Duncan Hull</a> et al. published around that time in <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000204">Defrosting the Digital Library: Bibliographic Tools for the Next Generation Web</a>) also talked about finding strategies and the best tools for this.</p><p>In this blog post I want to talk about the actual reading of scientific papers that you found with one of the strategies mentioned above. There are some interesting recent developments, and I think we will see some significant changes in how we read papers in 2010.</p><h3 id="printed-journal">Printed journal</h3><p>Holding the printed journal in your hands is probably still the most satisfying reading experience because of professional typesetting and color reproduction. But unless you have a personal journal subscription, it is not convenient as you would have to go to the library to read the paper. Plus, many journals no longer produce a printed version, or the library has only an electronic subscription.</p><h3 id="photocopy">Photocopy</h3><p>This used to be the most common way to read papers 20 years ago. But the quality of photocopies is usually worse than a printout of an electronic version, and photocopies are far more inconvenient to obtain. Reading photocopied papers will only be necessary for the small number of journals that produce no electronic version, or for older papers.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/#fn1">1</a></sup></p><h3 id="pdf-printout">PDF printout</h3><p>This is the way most people read scientific papers today, unless they just want to look up small parts of it. Quality color printers have become affordable, and the reading experience is similar to the printed journal with the added convenience of electronic distribution. Most people use PDF printouts for reading, and later discard the paper copy, sometimes even the same day. This is not only more expensive than reading on an electronic device, but also not very friendly to the environment.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/#fn2">2</a></sup></p><h3 id="reading-pdfs-on-a-computer">Reading PDFs on a computer</h3><p>This approach appears to be very common for reading just parts of a paper, e.g. to look up experimental details, a figure or reference. Most people now store papers as PDF (hopefully with an intelligent program such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a>) and not the PDF printouts. Looking at the PDF on the screen is therefore often the first step, and then the decision is made whether or not to print out the paper to read it in more detail. Reading PDFs on screen is possible, but not really convenient for longer texts. Screen sizes are often too small for the PDF format (A4 or US letter). Many people don't like the eye strain from looking at a screen for longer periods of time, although this is probably more relevant for reading books rather than reading a scientific paper.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://getutopia.com/documents/overview">Utopia</a> is a PDF viewer launched in December by the University of Manchester that enhances PDF files of the <em><em>Semantic Biochemical Journal</em></em> with interactive content and live linking to web resources. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://duncan.hull.name/2009/12/11/utopia/">Read more about Utopia</a> at <em><em>Duncan Hull</em></em>'s blog.</p><h3 id="reading-on-a-mobile-device">Reading on a mobile device</h3><p>Many mobile devices such as the iPhone can open PDFs and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://mekentosj.com/papers/iphone/">Papers for iPhone</a> makes this process convenient. But PDFs in an A4 or US letter format are almost impossible to read on a small screen.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://river-valley.tv/epub-is-the-only-format-we-need/">ePub format</a> is more suitable for smaller screens found on mobile devices. ePub is usually used for e-Books, but the Open Access publisher Hindawi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">since 2008 provides papers also in that format</a>. Although ePub is more suitable than PDF for mobile devices, it doesn't solve the problem that figures and tables are simply difficult to show on a small screen. Mobile devices are probably great for reading journal table of contents or the abstract of a paper (and an RSS reader such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswireiphone/default.aspx">NetNewsWire for iPhone</a> is perfect for this), but not fulltext papers.</p><h3 id="reading-on-an-e-reader">Reading on an e-Reader</h3><p>The screen of an e-Reader uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://river-valley.tv/electronic-paper-technology/">electronic ink</a> which not only means a much longer battery life, but also a very pleasing reading experience, including reading in direct sunlight. Electronic ink is black &amp; white, which is not a problem for fiction books, but limits the use for scholarly papers (and scientific textbooks). Ideally an e-Reader should have a 10″ screen, similar in size to A4 or US letter paper.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/07/how-big-can-the-kindle-get/">Kindle DX</a> from Amazon was announced in May 2009 and is currently the most popular e-Reader. The Kindle uses its own file format, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200324680">recent software update</a> now allows the Kindle to open PDF files. Some journals (e.g. the <em><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></em>) offer Kindle subscriptions, but that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://patrickmd.net/blog/2009/05/22/cancelled-kindle-subscription-to-nejm/">doesn't include early release articles</a> and no subscriber access to the journal website. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/technology/personaltech/09reader.html">number of similar devices</a> were demonstrated this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The Kindle is primarily an e-Book reader, and <em><em>David Crotty</em></em> over on the Scholarly Kitchen blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/01/06/doing-the-kindle-math-does-amazons-opacity-conceal-a-shameful-truth">is skeptical</a> about dedicated e-readers, because he thinks that market is just too small.</p><h3 id="apple-islate">Apple iSlate</h3><p>Unless you have been on a remote island for the last three months, you will know that Apple will announce a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/the_tablet">tablet computer</a> later this month. There is wide speculation about the technical details, but it looks like this will be a very interesting device for reading scholarly papers. In contrast to e-Readers it will not use electronic ink. This means a shorter battery life, but allows color documents and many other more traditional computer uses. Based on the iPod and iPhone experience, many people think that the iSlate will change the way we use tablet computers. One of them is <em><em>Kent Anderson</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/10/02/game-over-man-has-the-disruption-of-publishing-already-occurred/">Game Over, Man – Has the Disruption of Publishing Already Occurred?</a>).</p><p>Sports Illustrated did a very nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/12/02/tablet/index.html">demo of a fictional tablet computer</a> in December, and it is obvious that many of these concepts can also be applied to scholarly publishing.</p><h3 id="reading-web-pages">Reading Web Pages</h3><p>Most examples mentioned above try to reproduce the experience of reading something printed on paper on an electronic device. An alternative approach would move beyond the traditional format of a paper and rather takes advantage of the electronic medium. And it looks like the web technologies HTML5 and Flash are best suited for this.

The basic idea of the Article of the Future is to break away from the concept of reading a paper from beginning to end, and to make navigation between the different parts of a paper much easier.</p><p>Whereas the <em><em>Article of the Future</em></em> tries to make navigation with a paper easier, the <em><em>PLoS</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/15/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">article-level metrics</a> help with navigating to related content: citations, blog posts, reader comments, etc. The <em><em>Notes</em></em> feature lets registered users highlight text for specific comments – very much what you would do on a printed paper (but with the added benefit that everybody can see this note).</p><p>I'm most excited about projects that enhance the scientific paper instead of recreating an exact electronic version of the traditional paper. And HTML is a more promising format than PDF for these approaches. <em><em>Michael Clarke</em></em> (with whom I had the pleasure to do a session at SciFoo 2009) reminded us that <em><em>Tim Berners-Lee</em></em> invented the WWW in 1991 to facilitate scientific communication (with HTML and navigation both within and between documents as central concepts), but papers and journals have changed surprisingly little in the last 18 years (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/01/04/why-hasnt-scientific-publishing-been-disrupted-already/">Why Hasn't Scientific Publishing Been Disrupted Already?</a>).</p><p>fn1. Many journals are scanning their older papers and make them available in electronic form, e.g. <em><em>Nature</em></em>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> stands for <em><em>Open Researcher and Contributor ID</em></em> and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/orcid/media/pdf/ORCID_Announcement.pdf">announced</a> in early December. This blog post tries to summarize some of the problems that have to be solved to develop a unique identifier for scientists.</p><h3 id="1-identify-the-problem">1. Identify the problem</h3><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.gen2phen.org/researcher-identification-primer">Researcher Identification Primer</a> by the Gen2Phen Knowledge Center lists some of the problems that a unique identifier for scientists tries to solve, including</p><ul><li>Disambiguation of author names in the scientific literature and establishing/validating relationships between authors and publications.</li><li>A solid foundation for permitting and tracking online scientific contributions, such as database submissions, scientific blogging, and community curation efforts.</li><li>Knowledge discovery applications using some or all of the above components.</li></ul><p>The Gen2Phen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.gen2phen.org/event/irbw2009-workshop-may-13-14-toronto">workshop</a> co-organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/U7739E111/profile">Gudmundur Thorisson</a> in May 2009 discussed these issues in much more detail. One of several articles talking about the problem of disambiguation of author names (especially Asian author names) appeared in <em><em>Nature News</em></em> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/451766a">February 2008</a>. A December 2009 <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">editorial</a> emphasized that a unique identifier for researchers will be especially valuable to track scientific contributions that are not related to authoring a paper. Phil Bourne and J. Lynne Fink also wrote about this in PLoS Computational Biology in December 2008: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000247">I Am Not a Scientist, I Am a Number</a>. A number of tools have tried to solve this problem, but it is not possible to link the researcher identities in the many systems.</p><h3 id="2-define-what-you-want-to-accomplish">2. Define what you want to accomplish</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/gbilder/profile">Geoff Bilder</a> gave a very good introduction to the problem at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a> in August and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event_presentations.php?event_id=19">STM Innovations</a> in December. Both talks were similar, but the latter is available as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://river-valley.tv/crossref-contributor-id/">video</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Bilder_CrossRef_Contributor_ID.pdf">PDF</a>. He emphasized that ORCID is about <em><em>Knowledge Discovery</em></em> and not <em><em>Access Control</em></em>, and explained the terminology for <em><em>subject</em></em>, <em><em>identifier</em></em>, <em><em>profile</em></em>, <em><em>persona</em></em> and <em><em>credential</em></em>. <em><em>Access Control</em></em> is a related problem that is sometimes mixed in, but there is no requirement that a unique researcher identifier also has to provide secure access via whatever mechanism (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">Open ID</a> is one solution to that problem).</p><h3 id="3-win-support-of-stakeholders">3. Win support of stakeholders</h3><p>Founding members of the ORCID initiative can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/orcid/gallery.html">found on the ORCID homepage</a> and include publishers, funders, universities, organizations and software companies. A number of important stakeholders are already part of the initiative, support by more funders (besides the Wellcome Trust) and software companies (particularly those that build reference managers or social networking sites for scientists) would be great. Probably the biggest name not on the list is the U.S. National Library of Medicine that runs the <em><em>PubMed</em></em> database of biomedical literature (the ORCID members Wellcome Trust and British Library are involved in UK PubMed Central).</p><h3 id="4-make-decisions-about-the-general-design-of-the-system">4. Make decisions about the general design of the system</h3><p>Some of the design decisions obviously are not set in stone at this stage. One continuing discussion is <em><em>centralized vs. federated</em></em>, and it looks like ORCID will be a centralized system similar to the DOI. Geoff Bilder has some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">good arguments</a> for a centralized system. Another recurring theme is <em><em>how much control an individual researcher has</em></em> over his ORCID record. Although external assertion from publishers or funders will certainly be part of ORCID, the individual researcher will have an important role, not only because of privacy concerns, but also because this is the easiest way to fix errors that even the best automated algorithms for author assignment will produce. And it looks as if ORCID will be an extensible system that will for example allow publishers or social networking sites to add functionality they require. The discussion at the STM Innovations meeting in early December touches some of these issues and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://river-valley.tv/how-researcherid-will-resolve-name-ambiguity-in-the-scholarly-ecosystem/">recorded as video</a> (after the talk by David Kochalko).</p><h3 id="5-pick-a-name">5. Pick a name</h3><p>The name <em><em>Open Researcher and Contributor ID</em></em> (ORCID) is obviously a combination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</a> (Thomson Reuters) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Bilder_CrossRef_Contributor_ID.pdf">Contributor ID</a> (CrossRef). I would have preferred a simpler name, but I guess we have to get used to ORCID.</p><h3 id="6-build-on-available-tools">6. Build on available tools</h3><p>ORCID will be based on the ResearcherID software from Thomson Reuters. From what I’ve seen, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">Open ID</a> system will not be a central part of ORCID. But ORCID certainly will be designed to work together with Open ID and other authentication mechanisms. I don’t know what Elsevier and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Weertman_Taking_the_guesswork_out_of_author_searching.pdf">Scopus Author ID</a> will contribute to ORCID.</p><h3 id="7-form-an-independent-organization">7. Form an independent organization</h3><p>In order to be adopted widely, ORCID must be run by an independent organization, and not by a single publisher, software company, research organization or funder. With the experience of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">running the DOI system</a> to identify digital objects such as scientific papers, CrossRef would be one obvious candidate, but the ORCID founding members have yet to decide on that.</p><h3 id="8-secure-financing">8. Secure financing</h3><p>Starting and maintaining ORCID will obviously cost money. In my little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/04/26/a-few-questions-about-author-identifiers-the-answers">survey about author identifiers back in April 2009</a>, the opinions were split about who should pay for this. Journal publishers and database maintainers (referring to such databases as PubMed, Scopus or Web of Science) were the two most common answers. ORCID will make it easier for funding agencies to evaluate scientists and they might therefore also contribute to the system. Individual researchers hopefully will not have to pay for any of this, but their input in time is obviously required.</p><h3 id="9-promote-orcid">9. Promote ORCID</h3><p>A <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">editorial</a> in December was a good start to promote ORCID to a wider audience. A unique identifier for scientists will only become accepted if widely used. That’s why it is important that publishers and funders quickly adopt this service. Software companies that build interesting tools around ORCID are also critical, e.g. integration of ORCID into manuscript submission systems (including the use of ORCID for the peer reviewers) and social networking sites (including of course Nature Network). My experience with the DOI for papers (e.g. the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/11/thoughts-on-the-pubmed-redesign">limited support in PubMed</a>) tells me that adoption of ORCID will be a long process.</p><h3 id="10-involve-individual-researchers">10. Involve individual researchers</h3><p>Individual researchers currently have no way to get directly involved in ORCID. But some level of involvement is critical for an author identifier to work. The best place is currently probably the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1807278">LinkedIn Group</a> Unique Identifiers for Researchers started by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile">Cameron Neylon</a>. But I hope we soon see ORCID discussions on Nature Network and other social networking sitess. The best place on Nature Network to discuss ORCID is currently probably the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/groups/socialnotworking/forum/topics">Scientific Researchers and Web 2.0: Social Not Working?</a> Forum.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sustainability in science is nothing new. The term sustainability science was probably first used in 2001 (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_science">Wikipedia entry</a>), and the title of this blog post was already used by a 2002 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.297.5583.897">editorial</a> in <em><em>Science</em></em>. There are both journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://ejournal.nbii.org/">Sustainability: Science, Practice &amp; Policy</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.springerlink.com/content/120154/">Sustainability Science</a>) and conferences (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.nzsses.auckland.ac.nz/conference/index.htm">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.vie.unu.edu/article/963">here</a>) about this topic and you can get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://sustsci.aaas.org/files/University%20Survey%20V2.pdf">degree</a> in sustainability science. The term sustainability is usually used in the context of climate change and the conservation of natural resources.</p><p>Here I want to use sustainability in a broader sense, using the original definition: <em><em>able to be maintained at a certain rate or level</em></em>.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/27/science_and_sustainability/#fn1">1</a></sup> Examples where the way we currently do science will probably no longer be sustainable in the future include grant applications that have a chance of success as low as 1% (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.nature.com/peer-to-peer/2009/08/the_wait_continues_for_nih_cha.html">the wait continues for NIH Challenge Grant applicants</a>), the ever-increasing costs for access to scholarly publications (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.sennoma.net/main/archives/2009/06/what_happened_to_serials_price.php">serials crisis</a>), or the exponential growth of drug development costs without any increase in approval for new drugs in the last 60 years (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2009/12/09/drug_companies_since_1950.php">Drug Companies Since 1950</a>).</p><p>Sustainability in science requires the individual researcher to think about his responsibility, i.e. to go beyond research that is personally interesting and is paid for by someone. I do think that increasing sustainability in science is a worthy goal, and I picked six examples.</p><h3 id="make-access-to-research-results-affordable">Make access to research results affordable</h3><p>For those not working at an academic institution, many subscription-based journals now make their papers available after a 6-12 month embargo period. Immediate full access to an individual paper in these journals can cost anywhere between $10 and $30 ($31.50 Cell, $15.00 Science, $32.00 Nature, $31.50 The Lancet, $10 New England Journal of Medicine). As you can guess from the wide range for these journals alone, these prizes are probably not calculated to cover actual costs. Deep Dyve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blog.deepdyve.com/2009/11/03/a-new-market-opportunity/">launched a rental service for scientific content</a> in October. They charge $0.99 per article rental, but currently include only a limited number of journals.</p><p>Most researchers have access to subscription-based journals through their institutions. My university library currently has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.3205/mbi000161">budget</a> of about 900,000 € per year for just over 2000 researchers and 2600 students. Even with this money, our institution <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">can't afford subscriptions to all journals</a> import for my work. And subscription costs are increasing much faster than library budgets. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/12/13/on-giving-a-talk-about-open-access-in-my-department">Open Access</a> obviously is one answer to this dilemma, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2497">may not work for all journals</a>. Most of us would probably be happy to pay for journal subscriptions if subscription costs simply remained reasonable. Because a handful of publishers own a large part of scientific journals, this will only happen if someone representing a large group of universities and research institutions sits at the negotiation table.</p><h3 id="reduce-the-bureaucracy-in-science-funding">Reduce the bureaucracy in science funding</h3><p>We are currently spending too much time trying to obtain research funding compared to the time actually doing research. This is in part because the chances of obtaining a grant are often fairly low and grant applications have to be submitted many times, and because the duration of some grants is to short, e.g. only 2-3 years (sometimes meaning you have to start writing on the extension grant after the first year). Providing funding to excellent researchers for longer periods of time instead of funding projects is one approach to improve this situation. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has done this for many years with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/">HHMI investigators</a> and the Wellcome Trust last month announced a similar approach with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2009/WTX057403.htm">Wellcome Trust Investigator Awards</a>.</p><h3 id="communicate-and-use-research-results">Communicate and use research results</h3><p>A lot of research has practical value, but this practical value has to be explored. One nice example from my area of expertise is an international consortium to improve the outcome of a specific form of acute leukemia in the developing world. The first results <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.hematology.org/Publications/ASH-News-Daily/2009/4636.aspx">were reported</a> at the ASH meeting earlier this month, one of only a handful of abstracts to be picked for the plenary session. But use of research results goes beyond translational research, using them for science education (both in schools and universities) is equally important.</p><p>Science blogging could have an important role in communicating research, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2009/12/story-behind-nature-paper-on-phylogeny.html">this blog post</a> from a few days ago is a wonderful example of how a blog post can enhance a <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08656">paper</a>. It would be great if more journals would follow the <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals in linking to blogs posts about a paper,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/27/science_and_sustainability/#fn2">2</a></sup> and journals should help their authors to blog, e.g. by asking for a blog post (that could be hosted by the journal) on paper acceptance. Conference blogging is another area where science blogging would be a very welcome addition. It was nice to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/09/17/german-genetics-society-meeting-2009-introduction">official conference blogging</a> at the German Genetics Conference this year, and I hope to see more of that.</p><h3 id="develop-and-promote-technologies-that-make-scholarly-research-more-efficient">Develop and promote technologies that make scholarly research more efficient</h3><p>Obviously I have written a lot about this topic on this blog, e.g. about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like">article of the future</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/01/bibliographic-management-meets-web-2-0">reference management</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/25/editorial-manager-interview-with-richard-wynne">paper submission</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/05/01/extyles-interview-with-elizabeth-blake-and-bruce-rosenblum">validation, formatting and exporting of scholarly content</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">researcher identifiers</a>. But I believe that there is still a lot more that can be done, and I expect to see one or more disruptive technologies in the future. Time will tell if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/18/using-google-wave-for-a-week-its-still-great">Google Wave</a> is one of them, the Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) announced earlier this month certainly is a very big step forward.</p><h3 id="preserve-research-data">Preserve research data</h3><p>Providing and preserving the research data behind a project is becoming increasingly important, and simply writing up a paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.cotch.net/blog/20091223_1558">is no longer enough</a>.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/27/science_and_sustainability/#fn3">3</a></sup> In many areas we lack the infrastructure (nomenclature, databases, etc.) and resources for this, especially for long-term preservation.

There is direct evidence from atomic bomb survivors in Japan in 1945 and from nuclear accidents such as the one in Chernobyl in 1986. There are no studies directly demonstrating an increased cancer risk from the diagnostic use of X-rays (either conventional radiographs or computed tomography), as this would require long-term follow-up of a very large number of people. This risk can only be estimated, based on the assumption that there is no lower radiation threshold dose for cancer risk and that a linear correlation exists between dose and cancer risk. Similarly, we know very little about the actual radiation doses that patients receive during a diagnostic CT scan.</p><p>The paper by <strong><strong>Rebecca Smith-Bindman</strong></strong> and her coworkers looked at the radiation doses associated with the 11 most common computed tomography examinations in four hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Radiation doses to individual patients were not measured directly, but were estimated using the commonly used “effective dose”. Median effective doses for routine computed tomography of the head, chest and abdomen-pelvis were 2, 8 and 16 mSv. The highest median effective doses (31 mSv) were used for multiphase CTs of the abdomen-pelvis (range 6-90 mSv). The 8 mSv dose for a routine chest CT is equivalent to 119 conventional chest X-rays. Interestingly, there was wide variation of effective doses used both between hospitals and within the same institution (with a mean 13-fold variation between highest and lowest dose for each CT study type).</p><p>Based on these doses, the authors then estimated the increased risk for radiation-induced cancer following a CT examination. This risk is higher in younger people and in women. Women have a higher risk to develop lung cancer following radiation exposure and they have the added risk of developing breast cancer. The authors estimated that it would for example require approximately 620 CT scans for ruling out pulmonary embolism in 40-year-old women to induce one cancer.</p><p>The second paper by <strong><strong>Amy Berrington de Gonzalez</strong></strong> and coworkers tried to calculate the total number of CT scans performed in the US in 2007, and estimated the increased risk for cancer related to these CT scans based on examination type, age and sex. They used a similar model to calculate the cancer risk as the first paper. Overall, about 72 million CT scans were performed in the US in 2007. The authors estimated that approximately 29.000 additional cancers will eventually develop, equivalent to approximately 2% of all cancers diagnosed annually in the US.</p><p>CT scans have dramatically improved patient care, and the conclusions of these two papers should not preclude their use in patients where the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks mentioned above. But in order to reduce the cancer risk associated with CT scans, the authors of the two papers and the editorial suggest to optimize and standardize the CT scan procedure (remember the 13-fold difference in dose for the same procedure) and to decrease the number of unnecessary examinations. The latter is most relevant when CT scans are performed as screening procedures.</p><p>More blog posts discussing these papers can be found on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174153/http://blogs.nature.com/stories/2049">Nature Blogs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174153/http://www.cancer.org/aspx/Blog/Comments.aspx?id=336">Dr. Len's Cancer Blog</a>.</p><p><sup>1</sup> All three papers are available as full-text without a subscription.

        <updated>2009-12-13T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month I gave this talk in my department. It is basically a summary of two blog posts that I wrote in October during <strong><strong>Open Access Week</strong></strong> (Open Access Week: a researcher's perspective <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">part I</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/23/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective-part-ii">part II</a>), and I had given a similar talk in November in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=254">Open Access workshop</a> organized by the Helmholtz Association. But because this time my audience (researchers and clinicians in a university hospital) was less knowledgeable about Open Access, I added a few introductory slides in the beginning.</p><p>The discussion is usually the most interesting part, and this topic certainly has a lot of material for discussion. Interestingly, we talked mainly about the problem of <strong><strong>copyright</strong></strong>. Even though anybody who has ever submitted a paper to a (non-Open Access) journal has signed a copyright transfer agreement, the implications of this were not really clear to most people in the audience. Reuse of a figure or table in an academic seminar usually falls under <strong><strong>fair use</strong></strong>, but many journals still require a (free) permission.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/13/on_giving_a_talk_about_open_access_in_my_department/#fn1">1</a></sup> And using the same figure in a medical conference can cost several hundred dollars, and it doesn't really matter that you are one of the authors of the paper (slides 15-17 in the presentation). Some of my colleagues have run into issues with copyright, usually when the talks of a conference were later redistributed on a CD or website.</p><p>Unfortunately there wasn't enough time to discuss some of the other issues raised in the talk, e.g.</p><ul><li>Why can't our Medical School Library afford an institutional subscription for <em><em>Cell</em></em>?</li><li>Why is there no <strong><strong>institutional repository</strong></strong> at our university?</li><li>Why is it very unlikely that we will have a mandate for Open Access in Germany in the near future?</li><li>Why has the <strong><strong>Impact Factor</strong></strong> become so important in Medicine?</li></ul><p>The seminar was also interesting in that this was one of the rare occasions where I talked publicly in my department about some of the topics that I regularly write about on this blog. I always felt that most of my colleagues don't really care about these topics, and that they probably think I should rather spend my time working on the next paper or grant. I haven't gotten much feedback after the talk, but maybe I should reconsider that position.</p><p><sup>1</sup> Many journals use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://www.copyright.com/">Copyright.com</a>, which makes this process straightforward.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/about_journal.html">Nature Communications</a> is a new journal that will launch in Spring 2010. The journal will publish papers in all areas of the physical, chemical and biological sciences and is open for submissions.</p><p>The Nature Publishing Group publishes one fully open access journal (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/msb/index.html">Molecular Systems Biology</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/greengold.html">more than ten journals</a> that offer an open access option for authors (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/emboj/index.html">EMBO Journal</a>). <em>Nature Communications</em> will be the first Nature journal with an open access option for authors. <em>Nature Communications</em> papers where the author has not opted for open access will be available through an institutional subscription, or by purchasing an individual article.</p><p>There are many good arguments for open access, but from a journal perspective the publishing model must make business sense. Most open access journals use the author-pays model, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2497">an editorial in the August 2009 issue</a> of Nature Materials talked about some of the difficulties of this publishing model for the Nature journals – the costs that are currently spread among many subscribers would be prohibitely high for an author-pays option. Some high-profile open access journals have article publication charges that are probably not covering all costs (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.plosbiology.org/home.action">PLoS Biology</a>) or use a different business model that doesn't require article publication charges (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.bmj.com/">BMJ</a>). <em>Nature Communications</em> will have an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/open_access/index.html">article publication charge of $5000</a>, which is higher than what most journals charge. I interviewed Lesley Anson, the Chief Editor of <em>Nature Communications</em>, to learn more about the journal.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-nature-communications-for-me">1. Can you describe Nature Communications for me?</h3><p><em>Nature Communications</em> is the latest journal in NPG's portfolio. It is an online-only multidisciplinary journal publishing original research papers in all areas of the biological, chemical and physical sciences. The published research will be of the quality associated with Nature-branded journals, but won't necessarily have the high impact or broad appeal of papers published in Nature and the Nature research journals. In other words, we expect that papers published in <em>Nature Communications</em> will be of interest and importance to specialists within each field.</p><p>All research papers will be in Article format, regardless of their length, and will undergo rigorous, yet efficient, peer review and be published rapidly online. Authors of primary research papers can choose to make their published article available via subscribed access, or open access through the payment of a publication fee. <em>Nature Communications</em> will also publish occasional Reviews and Editorials.</p><h3 id="2-what-will-you-be-doing-differently-from-other-nature-journals">2. What will you be doing differently from other Nature journals?</h3><p>There are a number of differences between <em>Nature Communications</em> and other Nature-branded journals. For example, all other Nature titles publish print issues with regular news and comment sections and are available only by subscribed access.</p><p>Like other Nature-branded journals, <em>Nature Communications</em> has an independent team of editors who are responsible for maintaining the quality of the published research through rigorous peer review. However, <em>Nature Communications</em> has streamlined the editorial process – by limiting presubmission enquiries, appeals and the number of rounds of review – in order to secure rapid decisions for authors. The journal has also undertaken to publish research papers within 28 days of acceptance.</p><p>Another distinctive feature of <em>Nature Communications</em> is its Editorial Advisory Panel – to be announced shortly – which will consist of recognized experts from all areas of science. Their collective expertise will support the editorial team in ensuring that every field is represented in the journal.</p><h3 id="3-is-nature-communications-still-a-journal-in-the-traditional-sense-the-journal-is-online-only-has-no-news-and-views-and-the-articles-will-be-so-specialized-that-most-people-will-probably-find-papers-by-a-database-search-rather-than-by-looking-at-the-table-of-contents-">3. Is Nature Communications still a journal in the traditional sense? The journal is online only, has no news and views, and the articles will be so specialized that most people will probably find papers by a database search rather than by looking at the table of contents.</h3><p>I suppose it depends on your definition of a traditional journal. One could argue that we are going back to the roots of learned journals by focussing predominantly on primary research. In addition, like the traditional Nature-branded journals, <em>Nature Communications</em> has a defined scope and publishes only high-quality research.</p><p>We appreciate, though, that readers are accustomed to browsing journals by issue, therefore we are implementing technology to make the online browsing experience both intuitive and effective. There will be a number of ways for authors to find papers of interest to them, including personalization options and an extensive browse by subject category.</p><h3 id="4-why-did-you-decide-to-have-a-hybrid-model-of-both-open-access-and-subscribed-access">4. Why did you decide to have a hybrid model of both open access and subscribed access?</h3><p>We consider ourselves fortunate in being able to offer authors the choice of publishing with open access as well as subscribed access. Increasing support by funders for open access publication has made hybrid business models more viable for publishers. Furthermore, <em>Nature Communications</em> focus on primary research is particularly suited to a hybrid model because the cost of commissioning, editing and producing secondary content is minimized. These factors, and the high rejection rates on Nature and the Nature research journals, make open access charges for any other Nature-branded journal prohibitively high in the current market.</p><h3 id="5-with-this-hybrid-model-in-place-it-will-be-interesting-to-closely-watch-how-open-access-and-subscribed-access-articles-are-accessed-over-time-">5. With this hybrid model in place, it will be interesting to closely watch how open access and subscribed access articles are accessed over time.</h3><p>Yes, it will be interesting to monitor the average view rates for open-access versus subscribed access papers and we will be doing this following launch.</p><h3 id="6-does-an-author-decide-about-open-vs-subscribed-access-before-or-after-a-paper-is-accepted-for-publication">6. Does an author decide about open vs. subscribed access before or after a paper is accepted for publication?</h3><p>Authors won't have to make a final decision about access to their paper until the point at which their paper is accepted. Where authors do indicate a preference one way or the other during the editorial process, the reviewers will be blind to that choice.</p><h3 id="7-what-percentage-of-articles-do-you-expect-to-be-open-access">7. What percentage of articles do you expect to be open access?</h3><p>We can't predict what the open-access take-up will be like, and we are therefore prepared for open access uptake varying from as little as 0% to as much as 100%. <em>Nature Communications</em> business model works at both extremes and all values in between.</p><h3 id="8-how-does-the-transfer-of-a-manuscript-rejected-at-another-nature-journal-work">8. How does the transfer of a manuscript rejected at another Nature Journal work?</h3><p>The process of transferring a manuscript to <em>Nature Communications</em> is exactly the same as the transfer mechanism between the existing Nature-branded journals. Control rests entirely with the author, so transfers are only made at the authors request and with the understanding that the reviewers' reports from the previous journal will be transferred to <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p><p>Importantly, because all Nature journals are editorially independent, authors rejected from another Nature journal can choose to submit their paper to <em>Nature Communications</em> as a new submission. In that case, any submission or peer review details will remain confidential to the journal from which the manuscript was rejected.</p><h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-nature-communications">9. What are your responsibilities at Nature Communications?</h3><p>I am the Chief Editor of <em>Nature Communications</em> , which means I am responsible for the editorial content of the journal. I have a team of talented editors to help in the task of selecting suitable manuscripts for publication: a biologist, a physicist and a chemist. Their profiles are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/authors/about_eds/index.html">available on our website</a>.</p><h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-at-nature-communications">10. What did you do before starting to work at Nature Communications?</h3><p>Before taking on the task of launching Nature Communications, I spent more than ten years as a manuscript editor at Nature. During that time, I handled a number of different areas in the cellular and molecular sciences, and was also responsible for the editorial content of Nature's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/nature/supplements/insights/index.html">Insight Programme</a>. Before joining Nature I trained as a biophysicist at the University of Bristol and University College London.</p><h3 id="11-what-are-the-best-places-to-find-out-more-about-nature-communications">11.

        <updated>2009-11-18T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week the <em><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></em> (<em><em>NEJM</em></em>) published a paper on selective outcome reporting in clinical trials (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa0906126">Vedula et al. 2009</a>). The primary and secondary outcome(s) of a clinical trial could for example be survival in cancer patients or rate of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events in patients taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. These outcomes are defined in the study protocol before the first patient is treated, and whether or not the primary outcome is reached (using statistical testing) defines whether a trial was positive or negative. The study protocol is approved by an institutional review board (IRB) and can only be changed later (and that includes changes in the protocol-defined outcomes) if again approved by the IRB.</p><p>The study in the <em><em>NEJM</em></em> examined the outcomes of 20 clinical trials for the drug gabapentin using internal documents of the drug companies Pfizer and Parke-Davis, and compared them to the outcomes reported for those trials that were published as peer-reviewed papers. The internal company documents were obtained as the result of litigation in which the company admitted guilt for off-label marketing (i.e. marketing for uses that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration) of gabapentin.</p><p>12 of the 20 trials were published as peer-reviewed papers. In 8 of these 12 papers the primary outcome differed from the primary outcome defined in the protocol. New primary outcomes were introduced in 6 papers, and protocol-defined primary outcomes were not reported in 5 papers. Trials with primary outcomes that were not significant were either not reported as full paper or were reported with a changed primary outcome.</p><p>Selective outcome reporting has also been reported by other authors and is not limited to trials funded by drug companies (Chan 2004). Selective outcome reporting is a major problem because it a) distorts our scientific knowledge and b) is unethical as it involves research on human subjects. This could for example lead to repeated studies of a clearly ineffective or harmful drug or intervention. The distortion of our scientific knowledge by selective outcome reporting in scientific journals is also a concern for research in other areas. Confirmation of important research findings by independent groups is important, but a lot of research is probably repeated simply because negative results were not published. Some of these reporting biases could be avoided by making more unpublished research data available, either by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/">Open Notebook Science</a> or by publishing “unexciting negative” findings in peer-review journals or preprint archives such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>.</p><p>Clinical medicine tries to solve the problem of publication bias by making public registration of clinical trials mandatory before patient enrollment. This registration is required by most major medical journals since 2004 (De Angelis 2004). U.S. legislation also requires clinical trial registration and since 2008 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">FDAAA: Push to open data in clinical medicine</a>) this includes outcome reporting within 12 months after data for the last subject were received in the publicly available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a> database. These efforts should ensure ethical standards of clinical research, and help to avoid the kinds of biases reported in the paper by Vedula et al.</p><p>Clinical trial registries obviously also serve other purposes, as they help interested patients and their relatives and treating physicians to find clinical trials they want to participate in, and they help researchers and clinicians to do a systematic overview of the ongoing research in a particular field. Just as there are centralized databases (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/">Current Controlled Trials</a> metaRegister of controlled trials) and institutional repositories for full-text papers, there are also both central (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a> – Both PubMed Central and Clinicaltrials.gov are efforts by the U.S. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>) and institutional clinical trial registries. But in contrast to institutional repositories, there are no standard software tools available that an institution can use. I am involved in building a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien">clinical trial registry for our institution</a>, and the effort is both technically demanding, and socially challenging. The information in a clinical trial registry is constantly changing and we need to keep the efforts required by the individual researchers at a mininum. We also have to walk a fine line of what information can be made publicly available, and here we follow the standards provided by both Clinicaltrials.gov and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">WHO</a>.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/https://eudract.emea.europa.eu/">EudraCT</a>, the mandatory European clinical trials registry is regretably not available to the public.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Vedula, S., Bero, L., Scherer, R., &amp; Dickersin, K.

        <updated>2009-11-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In September <em><em>PLoS</em></em> started to show usage data (downloads, citations, but also use of social bookmarking services and blog posts) for all their published papers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.plos.org/cms/node/485">article-level metrics at PLoS: addition of usage data</a>). <em><em>PLoS</em></em> is not the first publisher to do that, but certainly the largest to date. Two Nature Network bloggers wrote about these changes back in June (The Scientist: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/06/22/on-article-level-metrics-and-other-animals">On article-level metrics and other animals</a>) and August (Gobbledygook: <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">PLoS One: Interview with Peter Binfield</a>), and a number of blogs commented on this new feature, including:</p><ul><li>A Blog around the Clock: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/article-level_metrics_at_plos_1.php">Article-Level Metrics at PLoS – Download Data</a></li><li>The Scholarly Kitchen: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/09/22/plos-releases-article-level-usage-data/">PLoS Releases Article-level Metrics</a></li><li>BMJ Group Blogs: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2009/11/02/richard-smith-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-impact-factors-and-journals/">Richard Smith: The beginning of the end for impact factors and journals</a></li><li>Blue Lab Coats: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://bluelabcoats.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/article-level-metrics-debut-at-plos/">Article Level Metrics Debut at PLOS</a></li></ul><p>There are a number of reasons why article-level metrics are a good idea, and I hope that many other journal publishers will follow. But in this blog post I want to talk about some of the shortcomings of the current implementation of article-level metrics.</p><h3 id="article-level-metrics-should-be-combined-from-different-places">Article-level metrics should be combined from different places</h3><p>Full-text articles live in more than one place. Obviously at the journal publisher's website, but in many cases also in one or more institutional repositories and at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> (or similar places for papers not published in the life sciences). Which of these places produces the most reliable article-level metrics or should the HTML views, PDF downloads, etc. from all these places be combined? The decentralized nature of institutional repositories makes it especially difficult to combine usage statistics from them, but there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english/">projects</a> that try to tackle this problem. A unique identifier is required to combine the usage data from these different sources, and we have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> for that. <em><em>PubMed Central</em></em> and similar large repositories could not only start to provide their own usage data, but also combine them with the usage data from those journal publishers that already provide them.</p><h3 id="article-level-metrics-need-author-identifiers">Article-level metrics need author identifiers</h3><p>Evaluating the “impact” of a researcher is one obvious use for article-level metrics. In order to be able to do that for more than a handful of researchers, we need unique author identifiers. This year we have had many discussions about author identifiers (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">this blog</a> and at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/23/thoughts-on-the-science-online-london-conference">Science Online London Conference</a>), and I hope that in 2010 we will finally see an evolving standard that is picked up by journal publishers. It would be in the interest of PLoS to combine their article-level metrics with an author identifier as soon as possible, most likely the proposed CrossRef ContributorID, rather than the Elsevier Scopus Author Identifier or the Thomson Reuters Researcher ID.</p><h3 id="article-level-metrics-should-enhance-literature-searches">Article-level metrics should enhance literature searches</h3><p>We all know how Google became the most popular search engine (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Pagerank</a>). And article usage data would be a tremendous boost for scientific literature databases such as PubMed. A literature search should sort the results by usage data (e.g. a combination of number of citations, HTML views and PDF downloads) rand not the rather boring publication date, author or journal name. Normally I would think that <em><em>Google Scholar</em></em> would be the first place to implement such a functionality, but I haven't seen much innovation from Google Scholar lately.</p><h3 id="article-level-metrics-should-not-only-be-numbers">Article-level metrics should not only be numbers</h3><p>As we don't want to reduce a paper to simple numbers, it is important to provide more than HTML views and PDF download counts. Citations counts are useful numbers, but linking to the citing papers is even more interesting. Similarly we want to see links to <em><em>Faculty of 1000</em></em> recommendations and blog posts aggregated at <em><em>ResearchBlogging.org</em></em>. If we extend this further, we should probably start to think about a better name for article-level metrics. And I hope we never start to call this ALM.</p>]]></content>

Just as PubMed, PubMed Central covers research in the life sciences, but not other areas of research, e.g. engineering, physical sciences or astronomy.</p><p>Some journal articles are available as full text as soon as they are published, and most journals provide free access to full text articles within a year of publication. Some journals only provide the full text of some articles, including research funded by the NIH under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">NIH Public Access Policy</a>. The majority of fulltext articles in PubMed Central are not Open Access, but are protected by copyright. These articles are often made available under a license that allows redistribution and reuse.</p><p>All articles are deposited using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM-DTD</a> XML format, which is a standard text format suitable for text mining and long-term archiving. Most articles are deposited directly by the journals, so that authors do not have to get involved in the technical aspects of article deposition.</p><p>PubMed Central is a centralized archive of full text papers and not simply an interface to search these articles at the websites of the participating journals. Neither is PubMed Central an interface to search the various institutional repositories at universities and institutions. The NIH thinks that this centralized approach makes it easier to develop additional functionality, including the integration with other databases (e.g. the protein or nucleotide databases) hosted at the NIH.</p><p>UK PubMed Central was launched in 2007 as the first PubMed Central outside the United States (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/">PubMed Central Canada</a>, the second international PubMed Central, launched this week). In January 2010 UK PubMed Central will launch a number of new services, and I used the opportunity to ask UK PubMed Central Programme Manager Philip Vaughan a few questions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/web.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="400" height="300"></figure><h3 id="1-what-is-uk-pubmed-central">1. What is UK PubMed Central?</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK PubMed Central</a> offers free access to 1.6 million full text journal articles in the fields of Life Sciences, Biomedicine and Health. Our content is free to read, print off and download. There is no registration process required: users can simply visit our site and start searching!It has been developed in consultation with the UK biomedical and health research community, and is about to launch some exciting new services in January 2010. Usage of our service has been growing steadily; we average 300,000 downloads a month currently.</p><h3 id="2-why-do-we-need-more-than-one-pubmed-central-and-how-are-they-connected">2. Why do we need more than one PubMed Central, and how are they connected</h3><p>UKPMC gives the UK research community access to all the content of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PMC</a>, but with added value specifically for the UK. For example, it offers Grant Reporting features, whereby users can search for current grants from all of our 8 Funders, can link the publications they produce to the grants they originated from, and view the impact of their work through access to citations. UK researchers can also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/https://ukmss.mimas.ac.uk/ukmss">deposit their manuscripts directly</a> into UKPMC.We will also be accessing additional content not in PMC; around 475,000 extra articles, reviews, guidelines and theses. Through the involvement of our funders, we are capturing around 90% of recently published journal articles from biomedical research conducted in the UK.We are therefore increasing the visibility of UK research in the field.</p><p>Our colleagues at NCBI in the US have been very supportive of our activities: they have been keen for the PMC “project” to expand beyond the US. A Canadian version (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/">PMC Canada</a>) launched this week.</p><h3 id="3-why-does-a-search-use-pubmed-central-and-not-the-uk-version">3. Why does a search use PubMed Central and not the UK version?</h3><p>The current UKPMC site searches PMC as it “mirrors” its content. But this about to change; from January UKPMC will be a “stand alone” service with its own up to date archive of content, as well as access to all the content of PubMed and PubMed Central.</p><h3 id="4-what-is-the-relationship-between-uk-pubmed-central-and-institutional-repositories">4. What is the relationship between UK PubMed Central and institutional repositories?</h3><p>UKPMC is a subject repository and as such receives content from researchers at Higher Education institutions across the UK. Deposition in UKPMC is mandatory if a researcher has a grant from any of our 8 Funders: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/">Cancer Research UK</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.mrc.ac.uk/">Medical Research Council</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.bhf.org.uk/">British Heart Foundation</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.arc.org.uk/">Arthritis Research Campaign</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/">Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.nihr.ac.uk/">National Institute for Health Research</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/cso/">Chief Scientists Office</a>. Consequently we do not need to harvest content from other repositories. However, institutional repositories are welcome to harvest our content; we have an OAI-PMH interface to enable this. On the other hand, there are no plans to develop of institutional repositories from within UK PubMed Central.</p><h3 id="5-what-is-the-material-that-can-t-be-put-into-uk-pubmed-central">5. What is the material that can't be put into UK PubMed Central?</h3><p>If the material is not peer-reviewed research published in a recognized journal by a known publisher, it would not be deposited into UK PubMed Central. One aspect of our development programme has been to identify what further content we could provide links to, for example published research theses and NHS clinical guidelines. But, we have rigid quality control procedures in place even to provide links to material. That said, we do remain open minded, in terms of what material we may consider linking to in the future. And who knows what might arise in the future. For example, there does seem to be an appetite to include images.</p><h3 id="6-can-i-submit-my-accepted-manuscript-if-it-was-not-funded-by-one-of-the-uk-pubmed-central-funders">6. Can I submit my accepted manuscript if it was not funded by one of the UK PubMed Central funders?</h3><p>Unfortunately not at this time. We are hopeful that other UK research councils and funders of life sciences research will come on board in due course. The more funders that come on board, the stronger our service will become and the stronger our message on the importance of OA.</p><h3 id="7-what-is-the-uk-pubmed-central-oai-service">7. What is the UK PubMed Central OAI service?</h3><p>The UK PubMed Central OAI service, (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/ppmc-localhtml/oai_service.html">UKPMC-OAI</a>) provides access to metadata of all items in the UKPMC archive, as well as to the full text of a subset of these items.</p><h3 id="8-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-uk-pubmed-central">8. What are your responsibilities at UK PubMed Central?</h3><p>I am the Programme Manager. I am responsible for the current service which has been in existence since January 2007.

What did you do before starting to work on UK PubMed Central?</h3><p>I originally trained as a librarian. Since then I have worked mainly in health and medical information work, both in Higher Education and in the National Health Service. My most recent post was for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a> (Joint Information Systems Committee) as a Programme Manager. I was responsible for a portfolio of development projects in the digital library sphere. I joined UKPMC at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a> in May 2008.</p><h3 id="10-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-uk-pubmed-central">10. Do you want to talk about future plans for UK PubMed Central?</h3><p>Yes please! We are soon to launch some exciting new initiatives in January 2010. Our website has been completely redesigned with a new more intuitive interface, and we will be expanding our content to include all content from PubMed (c. 18m references), patents, theses and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.library.nhs.uk/GUIDELINESFINDER/">NHS Clinical Guidelines</a>. Consequently our users will be able to access a vast collection of relevant content through one portal.</p><p>Our search engine will be utilising innovative new techniques such as text mining to retrieve more contextually relevant information, link to other relevant databases and provide a richer search experience for the user. We are also expanding our Grant Reporting functions to allow Grantees and Funders to assess the impact and value of their funded research, and increase their visibility.</p><p>Our Funders are keen to expand the programme, possibly towards a future <em><em>European PubMed Central</em></em>.We are hopeful that as part of this process some European Funders may be joining the programme shortly. Our Funders hope to make an announcement regarding this shortly.</p><p>We are holding a Showcase event on January 12th at the British Library in London to highlight these new developments and the future potential of the service.</p><h3 id="11-could-you-provide-contact-information-for-people-that-have-further-questions-about-pubmed-central">11.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week (October 19-23) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a> – a good opportunity to think and write about this topic. On Monday I wrote in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">blog post</a>:</p><blockquote>Open Access can be looked at from many different angles, including the researcher, the science library, the institution, the funding organization, the journal, the science journalist, and the general public. Most arguments for or against Open Access depend on that angle. As a researcher, I am most interested in whether Open Access will make my work easier. Again, a researcher can look at Open Access from different roles: reader, author, reviewer, editor.</blockquote><p>In that blog post I then wrote about the role of the researcher as a reader. Now I want to look at the perspective of the researcher as an author.</p><h3 id="choice-of-journal">Choice of journal</h3><p>The decision of where to publish a manuscript for most researchers probably works something like “find the best journal where I can publish my work with the least amount of trouble”. <em><em>Best journal</em></em> usually is a subjective decision, but probably correlates with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/free/essays/impact_factor/">Impact Factor</a> of a journal. As the average quality of manuscripts is higher in a <em><em>better journal</em></em>, this will help to value your research in the eyes of granting agencies and job search committees. <em><em>Better journal</em></em> often means higher rejection rates and/or higher numbers of readers. Both factors – and journals that publish a relatively small number of papers – favor a subscription business model<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="publication-cost">Publication cost</h3><p>Most Open Access journals use an author-pays model to pay for publication costs. Funding agencies or institutions may pick up these costs, but authors may be left with costs of $2500 or more.</p><h3 id="institutional-repositories">Institutional Repositories</h3><p>Self-archiving in institutional repositories (green access) is a great way to make your publication freely available if the paper is published in a journal that is not Open Access. Unfortunately this often requires extra efforts by the researcher, and the publication will be more difficult to find in the repository than in the journal. This creates little incentive for a researcher to get involved in self-archiving.</p><h3 id="citation-advantage">Citation advantage</h3><p>The effect of free access to the scientific literature on article downloads and citations is difficult to measure. Some<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn2">2</a></sup>, but not all studies<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn3">3</a></sup> show higher citation rates for articles that are freely available and this citation advantage might be modest<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn4">4</a></sup>. Citations are generated by other researchers who have access to your paper, and therefore I'm not surprised if there is not much of a difference between papers in Open Access journals and popular journals that are subscribed my many institutions.</p><h3 id="better-access">Better Access</h3><p>Researchers in poorer countries will have easier access to papers published in Open Access journals, although many subscription journals wave access fees through initiatives such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://www.who.int/hinari/en/">Hinari</a>. Open Access makes it easier for journalists, high school students, patient advocacy groups and many more people to read your papers. This is obviously of great value to these groups, but I haven't seen many examples where the paper author directly benefitted from this.</p><h3 id="social-responsibility">Social responsibility</h3><p>The argument that publicly funded research should be available to everybody at time of publication can be a motivation for many scientists, but I would be careful to turn this into an obligation. Different countries have different traditions, but in my home country Germany the independence of research and researchers (including the decision where to publish) has become a constitutional right after the atrocities committed in the name of “science” in Nazi Germany. All major German research organizations support Open Access, but in contrast to other countries there is no Open Access mandate.</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>Publishing in an Open Access journal has surprisingly little benefits for the author of a paper, and often means additional costs. Unless we want to mandate Open Access publishing from authors because it benefits the other stakeholders (which at least in Germany would be difficult), we should make publishing in an Open Access journal more attractive to authors. It looks like PLoS ONE is doing exactly that, as 400 manuscripts published per month testify.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Science in the open. (2009).

        <updated>2009-10-18T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week (October 19-23) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a>:</p><blockquote>Open Access Week is an opportunity to broaden awareness and understanding of Open Access to research, including access policies from all types of research funders, within the international higher education community and the general public.</blockquote><p>The following video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.arl.org/sparc/">SPARC</a> (the Scholarly Publishing &amp; Academic Resources Coalition) is a good introduction:</p><p>Open Access can be looked at from many different angles, including the <em><em>researcher</em></em>, the <em><em>science library</em></em>, the <em><em>institution</em></em>, the <em><em>funding organization</em></em>, the <em><em>journal</em></em>, the <em><em>science journalist</em></em>, and the <em><em>general public</em></em>. Most arguments for or against Open Access depend on that angle. As a researcher, I am most interested in whether Open Access will make my work easier. Again, a researcher can look at Open Access from different roles:</p><ul><li>Reader</li><li>Author</li><li>Reviewer</li><li>Editor</li></ul><p>The role as a reviewer or editor for an open access paper should be essentially the same as for a paper with subscription-based access. The journal <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> that launches in April 2010 with a hybrid publishing model of open access and subscription-based access will for example have reviewers and editors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/open_access/pdf/open-access-faqs.pdf">blinded to the author's choice</a>.</p><p>In this blog post I will look at Open Access from the perspective of the researcher as a reader.</p><h3 id="access">Access</h3><p>As a researcher in a German university I am privileged to have institutional access to most journal articles that I need for my work. I use the program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> as my main reference manager. Papers allows me to order my currently 1715 references (and PDFs of fulltext paper to most of them) by journal. Among the 20 journals with the most papers in my library, my institution doesn't have access to three of them:</p><ul><li><em><em>Cell</em></em> (don't ask)</li><li><em><em>Lancet Oncology</em></em></li><li><em><em>Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology</em></em></li></ul><p>Obviously three important journals for someone doing clinical cancer research. I could ask my institution to start subscribing to these journals, start a personal subscription (I had a personal subscription to <em><em>Nature Clinical Practice Oncology</em></em> for two years before it was renamed to <em><em>Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology</em></em>) which would set me back 150-200 â‚¬ per journal, or I could pay for an individual article (either through my library or directly from the journal). All this requires extra time and money, worth only if I think a paper/journal is really important.</p><p><em><em>PLoS Medicine</em></em> is the only open access journal among the 20 most popular journals in my Papers library (The <em><em>BMJ</em></em> has free access to its research articles and is the 24th most popular). Unfortunately there are only a few Open Access journals publishing papers that are relevant to my work.</p><p>As many others I do work from home in the evening or on the weekend, or while travelling. I am lucky that I can access my university network through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> and therefore can get fulltext access to journal articles (one of the most important VPN uses for me). But some researchers might not be so lucky, or spend precious extra time setting up and using VPN.</p><p>Researchers that work in a poorer country, or for a smaller university or small biotech startup will have much larger problems. Medical doctors in community hospitals or private practice may not have easy access to any of the relevant journals, and they might depend on reprints given to them by colleagues or representatives from drug companies.</p><h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3><p>If several people work on a research project, they also want to share the relevant literature in the field. Most subscription-based journals retain the copyright to the paper and don't allow storing in a retrieval system or transmitting of papers without permission. This could mean that you can't email the PDF of a paper to a colleague even if you are the author or his institution also has a subscription. And this could also mean that you can't use a reference manager such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.refworks.com/">Refworks</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> to not only share references with your lab colleagues, but also the full-text PDF files. Strictly following the copyright can make something as common as a <em><em>journal club</em></em> a complicated affair.</p><h3 id="permissions">Permissions</h3><p>As most subscription-based journals retain the copyright to the paper, you have to ask for permissions when reusing tables or figures. Most often this is the case when giving a lecture on a topic. For longer lectures this could mean a large number of required permissions, and the permissions might be granted just for a single occasion. Journals might not care much about using a single figure in a departmental seminar, but it definitely becomes an issue when the lecture is distributed electronically, e.g. as free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm">OpenCourseWare</a> publication of teaching material. Some journals provide Powerpoint slides for the tables and figures and explicitly permit the educational noncommercial use. In my experience most researchers aren't aware that they are using copyrighted material in their slides, and I rarely see the required copyright attributions.</p><h3 id="added-services">Added services</h3><p>This category has great potential, but is currently not yet that relevant in my daily work. Open Access to fulltext articles allows things that aren't possible or much more complicated with subscription-based access. This includes fulltext searches (to find information not in the title, abstract or keywords), semantically enhanced articles, and article-level metrics (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/15/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">recently introduced by PLoS</a>).</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>Researchers at large research institutions often have institutional access to most relevant papers. They are often not aware of the restrictions imposed upon them by the copyright of papers retained by most subscription-based journals. Open Access papers not only are freely accessible, but allow the uncomplicated redistribution and reuse for research and teaching, as well as innovative ways to find interesting research.</p><p>The perspective of the researcher as a paper author is stuff for another blog post…</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2009-10-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/profile">Anna Kushnir</a> who started it all. Frustrated with the limitations of PubMed when finishing her PhD thesis, she wrote a blog post in March 2008 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/blog/2008/03/22/i-am-not-yelling-not-out-loud">I Am Not Yelling. Not Out Loud.</a>) about her experience. The blog post created quite a stir in the blogosphere, especially among <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://mbanks.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/04/the-anna-kushni.html">science librarians</a>. At the heart of the controversy was Anna's complaint that PubMed is too complicated to use, and that some science librarians felt PubMed simply is complicated and that users such as Anna should take better advantage of the resources available to better use PubMed. David Lipman, director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a> and responsible for PubMed, said:</p><blockquote>Although the current engine works well for some users and some queries, I understand Anna's frustration and we are in the midst of a number of changes that will make PubMed work better for her and many other users.</blockquote><p>In May 2009 a PubMed redesign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/mj09/ppt/sunrise_gillikin/sunrise_2009_gillikin.html">was shown</a> at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Medical Library Association (MLA) in Honolulu, and the presentation explains a lot of the ideas behind the redesign. On September 30 the redesigned PubMed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so09/so09_pm_redesign.html">was unveiled to the public</a>, and as early as next week it will become the default PubMed web interface.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/35053.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="196" height="127"></figure><p>Several science bloggers have already written about the PubMed redesign, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/pubmed&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;-redesign-is-here-to-try/">very detailed blog post</a> by Jacqueline Limpens.</p><h3 id="what-is-pubmed">What is PubMed?</h3><p>MEDLINE is a database of more than 19 million citations for biomedical articles, hosted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.pubmed.gov/">PubMed</a> is the freely available Web interface to that database. Not only is the content of PubMed available from other databases (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/scholarly_research_analysis/research_discovery/web_of_science">Web of Science</a>), but PubMed can be searched not only via the Web interface, but also from within other applications, e.g. a reference manager such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://mekentosj.com/papers">Papers</a>. And PubMed doesn't cover all scientific journals, many disciplines (e.g. physics, social sciences) aren't included at all. In other words, the Pubmed web interface is not the only way to find biomedical articles, and in fact will not find literature not related to the life sciences. But the PubMed web interface is probably by far the most popular way to search for biomedical literature.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-target-audience">What is the target audience?</h3><p>The PubMed website is intended for at least 5 different audiences:</p><ul><li>science librarian</li><li>researcher in the life sciences</li><li>clinician</li><li>patient or patient relative</li><li>teacher, high school student, journalist and anybody else interested in life sciences research</li></ul><p>Before PubMed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/archive//20050113/news/press_releases/free_medline.html">was announced in June 1997 by the U.S. vice president Al Gore</a> as free web-based access to the MEDLINE database, most users were librarians, plus of a small group of academics with paid access (remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/2/321">Grateful Med</a> ?). Now we have a number of target audiences with different experience in literature search strategies and different intentions:</p><ul><li>librarian vs. academic vs. the general public</li><li>basic life sciences research vs. clinical research</li></ul><p>As PubMed is the most popular but not the only interface to the MEDLINE database, the primary target audience will not be a librarian, but someone with less experience in searching the biomedical literature (and less time). I would lump academics together with the general public here, and think that the typical PubMed search should be as simple as the typical Google search. Everything much more complicated than a simple input box should be moved to an <em><em>advanced search options</em></em> page, or should be done via a different interface to the MEDLINE database.</p><p>Searching for clinical literature is very different from searching for basic science research. Here a search is often done to help in the decision making for a particular patient, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> is used to find the most relevant scientific literature (with meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials providing the best evidence).</p><p>Searching for basic science literature has very different goals. It is either finding the needle in the haystack, e.g. you want to find all the published literature on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1176325">C3PO</a> gene, or you want to find a review article as an overview over a particular field. But basic science review articles don't have the rigourous tools available to evaluate clinical research mentioned above, and here review articles only differ in the personal perspective of the reviewers and completeness and actuality of the primary literature that was covered. Searching for basic science literature should also be tightly integrated with the other databases at the NCBI. This is done via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery">Entrez Search Page</a>, so that a search for <em><em>C3PO</em></em> also links to the organisms it was described in, e.g. this one:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/91px-Tribolium.castaneum.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="91" height="120"></figure><p>I don't think that a search interface to MEDLINE can be good at both the clinical and basic science literature. The current PubMed is much closer to the latter, so I think that the primary target audience for PubMed is the <em><em>academic or general public interest in basic life sciences research</em></em>. A good search interface for the clinical literature would be something very different and has to include both databases of evidence-based evaluations (particularly from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Collaboration</a>) and from ongoing and completed clinical trials (particularly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>, just like PubMed also hosted at the NIH).</p><h3 id="where-is-web-2-0">Where is Web 2.0?</h3><p>A PubMed redesign in 2009 can't be complete without looking at what Web 2.0 has to offer. This means that users should be offered a personal PubMed account that links to their libraries for fulltext articles, stores common searches, creates RSS outputs, allows sharing of search results with other users, publishes a link to an interesting article on Twitter, and possibly other enhancements (e.g. a public profile page of all your PubMed articles, but that wouldn't work without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://themindwobbles.wordpress.com/2009/08/22/breakout-3-author-identity-creating-a-new-kind-of-reputation-online/">author identifiers</a>). This also means a clean design, use of Javascript/AJAX for the user interface, a version for mobile users (particularly iPhone), and frequent small updates instead of a big desgin change every 2-3 years.</p><h3 id="and-how-is-the-redesigned-pubmed">And how is the redesigned PubMed?</h3><p>After this rather long introduction, what do I like about the PubMed Redesign?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/web-pubmed.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="506" height="422"></figure><h3 id="like">Like</h3><ul><li>Clean, uncluttered design</li><li>Saving a search as RSS is faster and more obvious. I hope that this will make many more people use RSS than email alerts for their regular searches (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/06/21/recipe-receiving-journal-table-of-contents-automatically">why I like RSS</a>)</li><li>Auto suggest: some of the most popular PubMed searches will be displayed based on the terms entered</li><li>Some use of Javascript/AJAX</li></ul><h3 id="dislike">Dislike</h3><ul><li>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> (the best unique identifier for a paper and the easiest way to link to the full-text article) is still not displayed in the standard abstract view (you find the DOI in the Medline and XML views)</li><li>Small design flaw: no easy way to go back from advanced search to basic search</li><li>Layout is now different from MyNCBI and the other NCBI databases (maybe this is work in progress)</li><li>(As far as I know) no version for mobile users</li><li>No send to CiteULike/Connotea/Twitter/FriendFeed, etc. buttons (popular with many journals)</li></ul><p>The redesign will make it easier for inexperienced users to do quick searches (as mentioned above, probably the target audience). Experienced librarians might like the redesign less, as advanced searches have not become easier. But overall the changes are minor. My biggest complaint is the lack of DOI integration. A wasted opportunity. And – as mentioned above – I think we need a different MEDLINE interface for searching the clinical medicine literature.</p><p>How do you like the redesign? Jacqueline Limpens is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/pubmed&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;-redesign-is-here-to-try/">doing a poll on her blog</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blogging is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090624/full/4591050a.html">a great way to report from a scientific conference</a>. This could be done either with regular blog posts written in the evening or after the conference, and/or live-blogging using tools such as Friendfeed or Twitter. One or more blogging scientists can not only add a unique perspective to the reports about a conference, but for smaller conferences blogging might be the only way to learn more about a conference you were unable to attend in person.</p><p>Conference blogging (particularly live-blogging) basically requires four things:</p><ul><li>a wireless network,</li><li>a computer or mobile phone with a full battery,</li><li>a hashtag (and other tools to find the conference blog posts), and</li><li>a blogging policy by the conference organizers.</li></ul><p>Wireless networks are now commonplace, but enough battery power (or power outlets that conference participants can use) can be difficult. A hashtag such as <em><em>#solo09</em></em> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a> is essential for live-blogging using Twitter.</p><p>The big problem is the blogging policy, or rather that there usually is a policy only for traditional media, but not for blogging. The blogging from the Cold Spring Harbor <em><em>Biology of Genomes</em></em> meeting in May by Daniel MacArthur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/06/on_the_challenges_of_conferenc.php">started a very helpful discussion about blogging policies</a>. It is impossible to write anything specific about a conference – and that's the stuff that is most interesting – without a permission from the conference organizer and speaker. This is best done before the conference has started. A July <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7252/full/460152a.html">editorial</a> argues that an opt-out policy, where everything can be blogged about unless the speaker or poster presenter specifically says so, is a reasonable alternative.</p><p>The organizers of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.genetics2009.de/">Annual Meeting of the German Genetics Society</a> that took place two weeks ago in Cologne did this right. Not only did they invite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> to become the official conference blogger, but they also put up a prominent link to his blog posts on the conference homepage, and they asked every speaker before the conference whether Alex would be allowed to blog about their talks. Because his blog on scienceblogs.de (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.scienceblogs.de/alles-was-lebt">Alles was lebt</a>) is in German, he decided to put up his blog posts here. I've asked him a few questions about this experience.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/knoll.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="250" height="375"></figure><h3 id="1-did-you-have-fun-being-the-official-blogger-for-the-german-genetics-society-meeting">1. Did you have fun being the official blogger for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.genetics2009.de/">German Genetics Society Meeting</a>?</h3><p>This conference blogging job was a first for me in many ways. I usually blog in German, so I wasn't sure if I would be able to bring more than my dry, scientific English. I also knew beforehand that there would be no theme, that the meeting was a general one. I would have at least to give the impression of having understood the basics of the talks. There would be no flitting about from talk to talk, I wanted to get whole sessions without interruption.</p><p>But on the other hand, I also got to know lots of people, many more than I would have as a lowly PhD student. I attended a conference I almost certainly would not have without the invitation to come and blog.</p><p>And, as any other (science)blogger will tell you, blogging is a labour of love (don't stab me in the back now!). So yes, I had a great time!</p><h3 id="2-blogging-about-the-conference-must-have-been-a-lot-of-work-">2. Blogging about the conference must have been a lot of work!</h3><p>About as much as I expected. I was frantically typing away at my little netbook keyboard during the talks to take notes, and used any spare time to put together the posts. So I did not have as easy a time as regular conference attendees. No problem, I came to do a job!</p><h3 id="3-did-you-meet-any-other-science-bloggers-at-the-conference">3. Did you meet any other science bloggers at the conference?</h3><p>As far as I'm aware, I was the only blogger attending, and also the only one tweeting from the sessions (no worries, no unpublished data got out that route).</p><h3 id="4-what-was-the-feedback-from-the-speakers-what-was-your-experience-getting-permissions-from-speakers-to-blog-about-their-sessions">4. What was the feedback from the speakers? What was your experience getting permissions from speakers to blog about their sessions?</h3><p>I got the whole range. From the really open “Go ahead! Write what you want, put it online. I'll talk about some unpublished stuff as well, but I don't mind” to some who are not interested in getting their work out into a blog at all. Great news for the conference blogging crowd: the balance was tipped more to the pro side! Most of the speakers came out somewhere in between those two sides, probably being a bit cautious about that whole strange blogging stuff. But I got mostly positive feedback from them, and I believe the next blogger will have an easier time when blogging about their talks!</p><h3 id="5-what-tips-would-you-give-a-conference-organizer-who-wants-to-promote-blogging">5. What tips would you give a conference organizer who wants to promote blogging?</h3><p>They should make clear from the start if blogging about the talks is generally OK. That doesn't mean all of the speakers have to allow blogging about their talk, but an official position will help everyone involved. You also don't need to have an <em><em>official</em></em> blogger, but especially at smaller meetings asking someone to blog beforehand is probably the only chance to get a blogger there at all.</p><p>I also have advice for speakers: Start your talk by telling your audience if blogging about it is OK! If a part of your talk is unpublished, tell them that as well. Or put an icon on your slides to indicate which is good to blog about, for example as Daniel MacArthur from the Genetic Future blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/07/conference_blogging_icons_for.php">has proposed</a>. If bloggers know beforehand if and what part of the talk is good to go, they will be more willing to take notes in earnest!</p><p>Now that my guest posting here at Martin's blog comes to an end, I would like to leave you with one of the last impressions, a rather lucky shot of Cologne Cathedral I took while leaving. Many thanks to Martin for hosting this conference blog!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344im_/http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3492/3969315341_4f8c590711.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>The final guest post by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031645/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p><h3 id="session-v">Session V</h3><p>Friday ended with two talks in session V, the first by Tony Hyman from the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden. He looked at the ways that cells structure and organize their cytoplasm by comparison with non-biological systems.</p><p>Next up was a talk on the innate immune response against the influenza virus by University of Freiburg's Otto Haller. When viruses infect mammalian hosts, a battle between interferons and virulence factors starts to rage. The interferon-induced GTPase Mx1 is an important resistance factor against influenza A viruses in mice. Most lab mouse strains are natural knockouts for Mx1, so they needed to create congenic, wild-type Mx1-expressing mice to research its function.</p><p>Interestingly, Mx1 expression protects mice against the usually lethal 1918 Spanish flu influenza A, even at high doses. Mx proteins are highly conserved in mammalian species and belong to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases. Otto Haller presented new and unpublished data (obtained in collaboration with Oliver Daumke's group at the Berlin Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine) on the role of the structure of the human MxA GTPase in repressing the virus.</p><h3 id="session-vii">Session VII</h3><p>The final session of the meeting started with a talk by Andrew McMahon from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in Cambridge, US, that I sadly missed. But one missed talk during the whole meeting is not that bad now, don't you think?<br>Ueli Grossniklaus then talked about epigenetics in the struggle between the two parental genomes of an Arabidopsis embryo. At the University of Zürich in Switzerland, his group is looking at the timing of expression of paternal alleles and their phenotypic consequences, all controlled by the maternal genome.</p><p>The last talk was given by Bruce Beutler from the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, US. He is looking into the ways in which the mammalian immune system is able to recognize microbes as foreign, and then mount an adequate response. A first answer was found when the receptor for LPS, a component of all Gram-negative microbes, was identified by positional cloning as Tlr4, a Toll-like receptor. You perhaps know Toll as a developmental gene in the Drosophila embryo, but in adult flies, it is required for the immune response to fungal and bacterial infections. So perhaps other Toll-like receptors also recognize other microbial ligands? Yes, and Bruce Beutler's group has been looking into the signaling pathways that lead from recognition by a Toll-like receptor to the induction of cellular responses. He and his group have used a forward genetic screen of randomly mutagenized mice. To date, they have generated over 100,000 mutant lines, and identified 32 mutations affecting Toll-like receptor signaling. This allowed them to deduce biochemical pathways that mediate much of the innate immune response. A similar feat was done with the genes involved in the resistance against mouse cytomegalovirus, with susceptibility mutations found in sensing and signaling pathways, but also in homeostasis and in development.</p>]]></content>

Irina Stancheva from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh started us into the day with a talk on epigenetics in mouse development.</p><p>One form of epigenetic silencing is methylation of cytosine bases in DNA. This is done by DNA methyltransferases like Dnmt1 for maintenance methylation, or Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b for de novo methylation, at CpG sequences enriched at promoters. During mouse embryonic development, DNA methylation is essential, for a loss of either of the DNA methyltransferases is embryonically lethal. Methylation and demethylation during development is surprisingly dynamic, with loss and new gain, and differences between the embryo and the trophectoderm. Besides the Dnmts, there are further proteins involved in the regulation of methylation levels. One interesting protein here is Lsh, a chromatin remodelling ATPase belonging to the SNF2 family. It seems to have a low ATPase activity in vitro, but it cooperates with several known factors like the DNA methyltransferases and Histone deacetylases. With mouse promoter microarrays, Irina Stancheva's group compared wildtype and Lsh knockout cells, and found a reduction in promoter methylation when Lsh is missing. The patterns of DNA methylation observed in Lsh null cells suggest that this protein has a role in developmentally-programmed methylation events in the early mouse embryo.</p><p>Dominique Soldati-Favre from the University of Geneva in Switzerland gave an interesting talk about her work on apicomplexan parasites. This phylum includes important human and animal pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum causing toxoplasmosis and malaria respectively. They belong to the clade of Chromalveolates, whose ancestor acquired a plastid organelle by the secondary endosymbiosis of an alga. While some members of this clade are free living organisms or predators the Apicomplexa have evolved as obligate intracellular parasites. These parasites have developed an elaborated strategy to actively penetrate the host cells by a mechanism distinct from phagocytosis and involving gliding motility. This active mode of entry is favorable to the parasites, because this way they can evade the host cell defense mechanisms. To identify and study the molecular components of the vital process leading to host invasion, the Soldati's group has developed genetic tools beginning from reliable DNA transfection up to the establishment of an inducible expression system for the malaria parasites based on transcription machinery elements similar to those found in plants. Studies performed on T. gondii have established that the mechanism of host cell entry is the result of a concerted action of adhesins involved in the attachment of the parasite to the host cell, the actin cytoskeleton and myosin motors that relocalize these adhesins from anterior to posterior pole of the parasite, and proteases that finally release these adhesins from the parasite surface.</p>]]></content>

Both talked about pathogenic microbes, but from a different perspective.</p><p>After Philippe Sansonetti told us about <em><em>Shigella</em></em> and the innate immune system during invasion of the gut epithelium, Julian Parkhill gave us some insights into two (genomically) very different organisms. <em><em>Salmonella typhi</em></em>, responsible for typhoid fever, has evolved relatively recently by changing its niche; it went from being a gut pathogen to a systemic pathogen. This can be seen in its genome, because its evolution is not characterized by the gain of genes, but actually by the loss of many genes through single mutations. For bacteria, <em><em>Salmonella typhi</em></em> is rather strange: There is almost no recombination between strains, so there are very few SNPs that can by typed. By looking at 200 genes in about 200 strains, they found 88 SNPs in total! Evolutionarily, their data point to mostly long-term neutral mutations, with only very few genes to be found that show evidence of positive selection. But the SNP data they acquired could be put to good use nonetheless: They were able to do an epidemiological analysis in the field by collecting S. typhi strains around Kathmandu.</p><p>The opposite of <em><em>S. typhi</em></em> in terms of recombination and SNPs is <em><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></em>, which comprises a hugely diverse group of freely recombining strains. With next generation sequencing, they were able to track the appearance and travels of a specific strain around the world. They even got enough SNPs in their dataset to be able to distinguish strains from different wards in a single hospital!<br>The talk was also a lesson in technological progress: While the sequencing of the <em><em>Salmonella typhi</em></em> genome a few years ago took 1.5 years, the next generation sequencing of <em><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></em> allowed the analysis of 66 genomes per run and week. Finally, we had a glimpse into the future: They are getting into single cell genome sequencing by doing laser capture microsdissection, and are already able to reach about 98% coverage!</p><p>Following this last talk of the day, the German Genetics Society awarded the honorary membership to Rolf Knippers. At least German speaking biologists should know him by name because of his well-known (and great, in my opinion) textbook <em><em>Molekulare Genetik</em></em> (Molecular Genetics), which first appeared in the early 1970s. But that was not the only reason for the award. Actually, Rolf Knippers has been a very good researcher and teacher, too! I didn't know him apart from his textbook before, but the laudatio and his acceptance speech (which he started by humbly asking if he deserved the award) made me wish I had met him earlier, perhaps as a student or even as a member of his lab.</p>]]></content>

Her research is on the molecular basis of variation in the life cycle of the model plant species <em><em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em></em>. Natural Arabidopsis strains grow in very different climates, and therefore have to adapt their annual life cycle to the environmental conditions: germinating their seeds early or late, flowering quickly after germinating or growing vegetatively for months. The ability not to germinate although there are good conditions is called seed dormancy. This can be a very important trait, for example if the Arabidopsis strain grows at a location where a short favorable period is followed by a recurring period detrimental to the growth of the plant. Then the plants which did not germinate even during the short favorable period have an advantage. But such changes in seed germination time need the whole life cycle to be fine-tuned: For the seeds of the following season to be ready before winter, the growth rate has to faster, or the flowering time shorter.</p><p>Because of the varying locations where Arabidopsis grows, there should be variation in life history strategies to be found for selection to act upon. For the model system of germination rate, Juliette de Meaux' lab found a high variations in 180 natural genotypes they looked at. Some strains germinated at the day of harvest, while others didn't germinate at all even 250 days after harvest, and most somewhere in between. If seeds were exposed to a cold treatment 250 days after harvest (to simulate winter), the strains that didn't germinate after the 250 days suddenly started to germinate, while others decreased in their germination rate at longer times of cold exposure. Such and other measurements allowed for the analysis of a very complex dataset to derive the different strategies of life history in Arabidopsis. For example, there is a correlation of growth rate and flowering time to be found, but only in strains growing to the north (of Europe), not in the southern strains. They also looked at the molecular basis of this life history variation, and the consequences of it, which were interesting parts of the talk in and of themselves.</p><p>The second talk was by Rüdiger Simon from the Institute of Genetics at the University of Düsseldorf. Plants also possess stem cells, and they are located in niches (in plants called meristems) at the tips of the shoot and the root. For the shoot apical meristem (SAM), it is already known that it is composed of the stem cells and an organizing center underneath. The stem cell proliferation is regulated by a negative feedback loop: Cells in the organizing center express Wuschel, which promotes stem cell fate, but stem cells express Clavata3, that represses Wuschel via the receptors Clavata1 and Clavata2. Apart from that, there is a second negative feedback mechanism of regulating Wuschel activity known. But according to computer simulations by Rüdiger Simon and his colleagues, there are further factors needed to explain the observed distributions of cells and gene expression. They looked for such factors, and found the coryne mutant, which resembles known clavata mutants; it must be in the same pathway.</p><p>Rüdiger Simon's lab also looked at the root tip stem cell niche, if it is perhaps also regulated by a Clavata-like pathway. Interestingly, they were able to find a Clavata3-related peptide in Cle40, that regulates the Wuschel homolog WOX5. While this is similar to the situation in the SAM, there are also differences: WOX5 is produced in the QC, which resembles the organizing centre that expresses Wuschel , but Cle40 is not produced by the stem cells, but by already differentiated cells derived from those stem cells.</p><p>Next, Bhupendra Chaudary from Gautam Buddha University in Greater Noida, India, gave a short presentation on the fate of duplicated genes in polyploid cotton. After a genome duplication event, the evolutionary constraints on duplicated genes are relaxed, and one way change is possible is by generating differences in expression, allowing for subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. They looked at expression differences in homoeologous genes (pairs of genes duplicated by a polyploidization event) in species of the cotton Gossypium, where parental diploid genomes as well as allopolyploids can be found. Interestingly, none of the parental genomes showed a dominant expression in the hybrids globally, but some tissue-specific transcriptional subfunctionalization.</p><p>The last talk of the session was given by Frank Kempken from the University of Kiel on mitochondrial mRNA editing in plants. Mitochondria possess their own rudimentary transcription and translation machinery, and in between they change the mRNAs in a way the nucleus doesn't: they edit the mRNA sequence, usually by exchanging a C for an U to create novel stop codons, or to modify the amino acid sequence. How this is done is largely unknown.</p><p>Frank Kempken's lab developed a system to work with isolated mitochondria, because genetic engineering of them in plants is not possible, and <em><em>in vitro</em></em> approaches have serious drawbacks. In their '<em><em>in organello</em></em>' system, they can electroporate the isolated mitochondria in buffer, and observe the editing done to the expressed mRNAs. This allowed them to observe correct recognition of editing sites of Arabidopsis mRNAs in the mitochondria of maize, for example, or that mRNAs from chloroplasts are not edited in mitochondria. This would at least partially be expected, but somehow the plastid transcripts are not recognized by the editing machinery in the mitochondria.</p><p>Using a novel binding assay (which requires 10 liters of Arabidopsis cell culture per experiment, whew!) they were able to find proteins that bind to mRNAs at editing sites. A knockout mutant of one of them leads to growth retardation and smaller plants, exactly what one would expect when mitochondria don't function properly anymore.</p>]]></content>

Not because of a bad presentation, I should add! Her work on biochemical properties of translation involves kinetic data of a row of proteins involved in the phases of translation: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling.</p><p>I'll give you a short summary of the initiation of translation in bacteria: First the 30S subunit of the ribosome binds a mRNA and the initiator tRNA with the help of effector proteins to form the 30S initiation complex. The 50S subunit then binds to that to form the 70S initiation complex. By fluorescently labelling all of the components of the complex, they were able to measure the rate constants (how do they bind and dissociate from the ribosome) and then calculate the binding rates to find the order of binding. This is hardest to establish for the mRNA, because of control elements like the composition of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or secondary structures. But ignoring all of these elements, the most significant factor at this step is the mRNA concentration. Looking at secondary structure, the unfolding of the mRNA is the slow step after a quick binding. This represents a kind of stability switch to enable correct start codon recognition. Not only during initiation, but also for elongation Marina Rodnina's lab could show that a lot of checks are kinetic in nature. Essentially, this can be summarized by the concept of induced fit: correct substrates are selectively stabilized by accelerating their forward steps.</p><p>Following was a short presentation by Matthias Schäfer on unpublished research. At the ETH Zürich in Switzerland, he is looking into the molecular role of protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the epidermis.</p><p>Aria Baniahmad fom the Jena University Hospital, Germany, talked about an interesting connection of telomerase activity and androgens in prostate cancer. There, telomerase is usually active, as in many cancers to allow the cancer cell to divide indefinitely. Androgens repress telomerase activity, which is probably one reason why prostate cancer occurs later in life, when androgen levels decrease in men.</p><p>The decrease of telomerase activity is based on binding of the androgen receptor to the promoter of the catalytic telomerase subunit hTERT. In many prostate cancers, an androgen receptor with a specific point mutation can be found. This mutated AR's binding to the telomerase promoter is weaker, which results in increased telomerase expression.</p><p>The session was closed with a talk by Thorsten Hoppe from the Institute for Genetics of Köln University, who presented intruiging, but unpublished data about his research on ubiquitin and ageing in <em><em>C. elegans</em></em>.</p>]]></content>

Apart from being interesting to work with, it also is good for some rather funny paper titles</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032512im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" class="kg-image" alt=";-)" loading="lazy"></figure><p>At the start, she gave a short introduction on the proterties of SUMO. It is similar to Ubiquitin (it stands for Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier) and gets covalently bound to lysines of hundreds of proteins to change their protein or DNA interactions, localization, or activity. A good example I also know from my work is the yeast DNA repair helicase Srs2, which only interacts with the SUMOylated form of the replication protein PCNA at the replication fork to suppress recombination. Many protein-protein interactions that are dependent on SUMOylation can be traced back to non-covalent recognition of a SUMO-interaction motif, SIM.</p><p>Like with ubiquitin, there is an enzymatic cascade to bind a SUMO unit to a target protein; however, there is only one E1 activating and one E2 conjugating enzyme, and a handful of E3 SUMO ligases (compared to hundreds for the ubiquitin pathway). Target recognition is not understood very well, but there is a known consensus site wich is recognized by the E2 enyzme for SUMOylation. The problem is: many proteins are SUMOylated at non-consensus sites. Another mechanism turns the usual direction of the pathway on its head: The target proteins interacts with SUMO via a SIM, while it is still bound to the E2 enzyme. This allows the E2 to transfer SUMO to the target protein.</p><p>Finally, Frauke Melchior told us about an interesting pair of proteins that are involved in SUMOylation: RanGAP (RanGTPase activating protein) interacts with RanBP2 at the nuclear pore complex after it gets SUMOylated. RanBP2 itself is a SUMO E3 ligase, but not for RanGAP. Without going into too much detail (unpublished data), the story unraveled by Frauke Melchior and her coworkers showed a really complex and intriguing picture of the role SUMO plays in regulating the activity of this complex and the effect on nuclear transport.</p><p>In the second talk of the session, Chris Wylie from the Developmental Biology division of the Cincinnati Children's hospital threw out the simple model of germ cell migration in mouse embryos found in the textbooks: During embryo development, the stem cells of the gametes, the germ line stem cells, have to migrate to their niche in the gonads. They start their travels in a structure called the allantois, go through the hindgut and from there to the genital ridges, where the gonads will form. Classically, it was thought that long range signals guide their migration. But this is problematic, because the target organ supposed to produce the guiding signal is not formed when the germ cells start their migration, and during the migration the surroundings and distances will change dramatically! That means there must be short range signals for guidance.</p><p>A nice example to test this is the trip from the midline above the gut to the genital ridges. Germ cells that stay at the midline will die by apoptosis. The previously known stem cell survival factor Steel is involved in preventing apoptosis in the cells. Its concentration decreases from the ridges to the midline; adding Steel everywhere experimentally saves the midline germ cells from apoptosis, while blocking Steel everywhere kills the germ cells laterally. They were able to show that Steel is not only involved in apoptosis, but also in the migration and proliferation of the germ cells. Steel is not only required at the late migration from the midline to the genital ridges; from the start in the allantois, loss of Steel leads to loss of germ cell number and migration.</p><p>Essentially, this means that not only is Steel one (of probably many) short range signals, but it also travels with the germ cells along their migration route, giving them a mobile stem cell niche!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031744/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p><p>Just after lunch the next decision: Neurogenetics or Evolution? Here I went with the topic that is less far from my field, and attended the evolution session. Welcome to the modern times, because next generation sequencing and high throughput are the way to go!</p><p>These were the methods of choice for Julia Zeitlinger from the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City to compare transcription factor binding sites between several Drosophila species. This goes back to the question, which process contributes more to evolution: mutations in the protein-coding parts of genes, or the sequences needed for the transcriptional regulation of these genes, the so-called cis-regulatory elements. There is evidence in some organisms of a high turnover of transcription factor binding sites, and Julia Zeitlinger wanted to compare these in the genus Drosophila. This was done with chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, where you analyze the sequence of DNA fragments to which a target protein like a transcription factor is bound. Earlier, this was followed by hybidisation of microarrays (ChIP-chip), today these DNA fragments can be directly sequenced with next generation methods (ChIP-seq). They chose the dorso-ventral patterning in the Drosophila embryo as a model system, with transcription factors like Twist that are well studied, and that have conserved binding sites. Surprisingly, they found that Twist binds to about 8 times more positions than were expected; sometimes Twist bound at more than one position at target genes.</p><p>Across Drosophila species the binding sites of Twist were very similar, especially near transcriptional start sites the positions are mostly conserved. Although movements of binding sites exist, they are rare. So it seems that there is evolutionary pressure to maintain the sites.</p><p>Also about the evolutionary contributions of cis-regulatory regions was the talk by Diethard Tautz from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plants, Germany. But he addressed them with population genetics of wild house mouse strains. With microarray and qPCR experiments, his lab was able to find that the majority of genes they looked at follow a neutral evolution. When this is not the case, most of those genes show only tissue-specific changes in expression, which points to cis-regulatory elements.</p><p>They also found a newly evolved gene in the mouse: In a region that is completely free of annotated transcripts in other mammals, one transcript can be found in the mouse. Poldi, as it is called, is expressed in the mouse testis and encodes a non-protein coding RNA. They were able to follow its birth in the genus Mus, where it appeared about 2.5 million years ago by changes in promoter regions. And although Poldi appeared relatively recently, it plays a role in the mouse. A knockout results in mice with reduced sperm motility and smaller testis, because several chromatin-regulating proteins show different expression levels in the absence of Poldi.</p><p>Now on to some computational biology by Andrew Hufton from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. He analyzed a special kind of cis-regulatory elements: the so-called conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), that don't show much chance even over great evolutionary distances. Why do they exist? There are two competing hypotheses; either the CNEs repress genome rearrangements, or they promote the retention of duplicate genes nearby. To test both hypotheses, Andrew Hufton identified so-called phylogenetically conserved non-coding elements. These are elements associated with gene families and are not biased for one of the hypotheses. With experiments in zebrafish, he found that most of the PCNEs are enhancers, sequences involved in the regulation of gene expression.</p><p>Concerning the two competing hypotheses, he found a strong association between PCNE and synteny conservation – the first hypothesis: the PCNEs are enriched around genes with an ancient gene order. For the retention of duplicated genes, he showed us an alternative model.</p><p>In the last short talk of this session, Stephan Greiner told us about a plant with a strange inheritance. At the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology at Potsdam-Golm in Germany, he is working on the Evening Primrose Oenothera. It combines some very interesting genetic features like easy crossings between species, fertility of the resulting hybrids, biparental transmission of chloroplasts (that are usually inherited maternally) and something very strange called permanent-translocation heterozygosity: The chromosomes of Oenothera easily break at the centromeres, so that translocations of chromosome arms happen. This leads to rings or chains of chromosomes during meiosis that suppress homologous recombination and the intermixing of haploid chromosomes. In the end, there are a handful of stable genomes that a transmitted stably, and a hybrid plant with a combination of two of these genomes will always have hybrid offspring.<br>Add in the possibility to exchange one of several different chloroplast genomes in only two generations, and you will be able to generate compatibility charts of nuclear and chloroplast genomes, where lethal combinations and less severe phenotypes occur. Taken one step further, it is possible to identify speciation genes in the chloroplast genome.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post by Alex Knoll reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p><p>This time I had to decide between two parallel sessions for the first time at this meeting. Plant genetics or Development? Coming from plant molecular genetics myself, there perhaps was a ready-made decision, but I decided otherwise. There will be a second plant genetics session, and work with the axolotl and spiders lured me to the developmental biologists. But I had a rather hard time following all the new information, so please bear with me! To get at least a little bit of information about the plant genetics session, take a look into the meeting program for the abstracts (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031830/http://conventus.de/fileadmin/media/2009/genetik/PDF/2009_09_14_Genetik_2009_Programm_klein.pdf">PDF</a>).</p><p>Elly Tanaka from the Center for Regenerative Therapies in Dresden, Germany is working with the axolotl, a salamander, as her model to research the molecular and cellular events needed for spinal cord regeneration. Choosing the axolotl was a good idea because it can regenerate lots of tissues and organs, it even grows back whole legs and its tail. On the other hand, her group had to develop all of the molecular genetics fresh from the start, which was quite a lot of work I guess. But they did it, and now have EST sequences, can do single cell electroporation for gene transformations, morpholino knockdown of gene expression is possible. They were able to get transgenes transferred through the germline, can express genes in specific tissues and establish cell cultures. Quite a set, isn't it?</p><p>This enabled Elly Tanaka's lab to look at the events after the axolotl loses its tail by a cut, specifically how the spinal cord is able to grow back. There are two basic ideas how this is done: either it grows from the end, or it expands by cell division within the spinal cord. They found that the second hypothesis is true, because a about 500 Âµm long zone right after the cut gives rise to the cells of the regenerated spinal cord. By looking at molecular markers at this zone, they were able to determine that the glial cells are the progenitors for the regeneration, and they need to revert to a more primitive state.</p><p>The second invited speaker of this session, Thomas Klein from the Institute of Genetics at the University of Düsseldorf, spoke about the newly analyzed gene Lgd in the fly <em><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></em> that regulates the activity of the well-known Notch gene by a new mechanism. Since this is about unpublished work, I won't go into more detail here.</p><p>Of the three short presentations in this session, the talk of Annegret Bördlein from the Institute of Human Genetics in Erlangen, Germany, also contained essentially unpublished data.</p><p>Luckily, I am free to write about the other two talks! Thomas Widmann from the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden looked at the cell shape changes in the imaginal disc in Drosophila. This structure of the fly larva will later give rise to parts of the outside of the adult body, including the wings (who would have guessed?). In the wing disc epithelium there are to cell layers that chance their shape during development: One flattens, the other elongates to columns. Thomas Widmann was able to find the two transcription factors Dpp and Wingless implicated in this shape change, since columnar cells lacking these factors are shorter. How is this done in the cell? The actin-myosin cytoskeleton builds a meshwork underneath the plasma membrane to generate tension, and the amount of force is controlled by Rho1 that can phosphorylate Myosin II. By downregulating Rho1, the cell get elongated, its overexpression shortens them. Dpp is one factor that enhances the activity of Rho1. That way, Dpp and Rho1 maintain the length in these cells.</p><p>Finally Wim Damen told us about his work on the developmental processes in the spider <em><em>Achaearanea tepidariorum</em></em>. At the Deparment of Genetics at the University of Jena, he is looking into segmentation processes. What happens during segmentation is very well understood in Drosophila, where a gene cascade forms all of the segments at approximately the same time. In vertebrates, the somites are comparable as a segmentation process, but here one forms after the other. Wim Damen found that in the spider, the anterior and central segments are formed like in insects rapidly and almost at the same time, but the posterior segments are formed one by one like in vertebrates. Here are even homologous genes like Notch and Wnt8 required for the segmentation. In the central region, Hunchback is essential for the production of the spider's legs. After RNAi knockdown of Hunchback, the spiders lack some of their legs because the L1, 2 and 4 segments don't form. This combination of insect and vertebrate-like processes during segmentation probably means that also their last common ancestor possessed both mechanisms.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>The second guest post from fellow science blogger Alex Knoll reporting from the German Genetics Conference currently held in Cologne.</em></em></p><p>The first session was all over the place in terms of topics.</p><p>Starting off the meeting, Linda Partridge from the Institute of Healthy Ageing in London and the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne told us about the Genetics of Ageing.</p><p>Looking back, there has been a linear increase of life expectancy in humans for a rather long time now, with about 2.5 years added every decade. That comes down to about 6 hours of increased life expectancy per day!</p><p>While there is no single cause for ageing, it is nonetheless controlled by genes and can evolve. And although life expectancy is generally correlated with the body size of animals, there are several exceptions like the little Brandt's bat that can live for 38 years, and there are also some organisms that don't seem to age at all!</p><p>At first it was thought that the research of ageing in model organisms would not be too relevant for the understanding of human ageing, because there were many unique pathways in the different animals. Interestingly, in many model organisms like the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fly <em><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></em> and also the mouse, the insulin pathway plays a big role: When components of this pathway are knocked out, the lifespan of the animal increases. This means the healthy lifespan, the organisms spend more time in the prime of their life instead of just being old and sick for a longer time. Even in humans, population genetics studies found homologues of some of these genes as candidates. The implication of the insulin pathway fits nicely to earlier observations of dietary restriction: If you put an organism on a diet with less calories than it usually eats, it will live longer. This is rather easy to do in the fly: just dilute the sugar solution it eats. This way it was possible for the people in Linda Partridge's lab to compare putative genes implicated in ageing with dietary restriction.</p><p>They then asked the question: how deeply is the genetics of ageing conserved between organisms? By using comparative microarray studies with worm, fly and mouse, they were able to identify functional categories of genes that are up- or downregulated in ageing.</p><p>Frank Grosveld from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam talked about a systems biology approach to understand the transcriptional regulation of globin genes in the mouse. During the development of red blood cells, several large multiprotein complexes act as transcription factors and bind to regulate the proliferation and differentiation. With a systems biology procedure, Frank Grosveld's lab tried to find and identify binding partners of known transcription factors during early and late stages of erythrocyte differentiation. For example, GATA1 makes several different complexes that very early on repress non red cell genes to prime the lineage, later another complex with GATA1 represses proliferation as a requirement for differentiation.</p><p>Interestingly, the globin locus that is expressed during erythrocyte development, lies in between many olfactory genes. With the help of several proteins binding at a number of regulatory regions, the structure of the chromatin is altered so that these olfactory genes are looped out and the components of the globin locus come to lie near each other. This also enables long range interactions of elements that are farther away, sometimes several megabases! The chromatin loops also change depending on the tissue: the globin locus is expressed in the fetal liver, and there it contacts other actively expressed genes. In the fetal brain, on the other hand, the globin locus is inactive, and it contacts mostly other inactive genes. The looping can even be shown microscopically by measuring the volume of the the globin locus. In expressing tissue the volume decreases, which indicates extra looping.<br>Another interesting aspect of Frank Grosveld's work touches blood disorders like thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. These result from defects in the beta-globin gene and are hard to treat. The idea here is great: in fetal tissues, the gamma-globin genes are expressed, but they are repressed perinatally. They have been able to identify a handful of proteins that are responsible for this repression in mice, and downregulation of these proteins leads to an upregulation of gamma-globin expression and a downregulation of beta-globin. These repressors are now novel targets to develop a new type of treatment for these anemias.</p><p>Finally, Marjori Matzke from the Gregor Mendel Institute in Vienna spoke about epigenetics in plants. Specifically, she told us about her research into RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) as a way to regulate transcription in plants, where not only repeats and other such elements are processed, but also single genes. This is done via small RNAs and the action of the two RNA polymerases PolIV and PolV. These are related to the standard RNA polymerase PolII, but possess different C-terminal domains that are responsible for their functional diversification. After 24-nt long siRNAs are produced, they lead to de novo methylation and thus inactivation of target sites with the help of PolV and other factors. From this inactivated locus then further siRNAs are produced with PolIV to keep the methylated state. Using a silenced GFP expression system, the Matzke lab searched for mutants with defects in RdDM, and found several until now.<br>RNA-dependent DNA methylation as a further method of transcriptional regulation in the cell, for example for stress responses in plants that can't run away from the stress arrived at an interesting time in plant evolution. The group of flowering plants appeared rather abruptly in the fossil record, prompting Charles Darwin famously to speak about an 'abominable mystery'. PolV and other factors involved in RdDM are only to be found in flowering plants, which could let one conclude that the newly evolved epigenetic plasticity played at least a part in the evolution of this successful group.</p><p>The first day of the meeting ended with a public lecture by Peter Propping from Bonn in Germany. His talk in German was about the history and future of human genetics (“Der Mensch und seine Gene in der Welt von morgen”). He started by telling us about the problematic standing of human genetics in the middle of the last century, mostly because of concerns stemming from the earlier decades with eugenics, sterilizing and killing people because of genetic concerns.</p><p>The big successes then came with the research into monogenetic diseases, which firstly were reached by methods such as positional cloning. Now is the time to study multifactorial diseases, which are much harder to tackle; here we have many genes which only contribute a small amount to the phenotype, and environmental effects contributing as well. A nice example of a new kind of genetic defect are copy number variants, where a sequence is repeated a different number of times between individuals. But this is not well understood for now, because the same CNVs can be found in diseased patients, but also in healthy people.</p><p>In the future a lot of work will be done with next generation sequencing, which will hopefully put a lot of data into the hands of the researchers. On the other hand, this means that a lot of money will be spent – a criticism that can be heard already now.</p><p>Another part of his talk was about the possibilities of and problems of prenatal screening. It was rather surprising for me to hear that in Germany in about 10% of pregnancies a screening is done, mostly to look for chromosomal mutations like trisomy 21 (that is responsible for Down syndrome)! Pre-implantation diagnostics in the course of in vitro-fertilization, however, is not allowed in Germany, which lead to a PID tourism into other European countries.</p><p>Finally Peter Propping also talked about the new law for genetics diagnostics in Germany, which has some problems. For example, genetic analysis is defined by methods in the law, which leads to the curious case that even simple biochemical work such as blood group determination falls under the regulations of the new law!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post from Alex Knoll reporting from the German Genetics Conference in Cologne.</em></em></p><p>Dusko Ehrlich fom Jouy en Josas in France started off the second session of the meeting. He is working with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003105714/http://www.metahit.eu/">MetaHIT project</a>, which tries to do a metagenomic analysis of the human intestinal tract. This is interesting because each individual human carries about ten times more microbial cell in the gut than there are human cells in the whole body! These microbes provide the interface between the food we take in and the epithelial cells of the gut. There, they play many roles not only in metabolising materials and molecules we are not capable of, but they also produce vitamins for us and help the immune system. It is therefore very important to understand this further organ of our body, as Dusko Ehrlich called it.</p><p>The MetaHIT project takes many approaches to understand the interaction between the human intestinal microbes and human phenotypes like obesity ore bowel diseases. For example, they want to sequence a reference gene set and then look for associations of these genes with diseases. The reference gene set is produced by Solexa paired-end sequencing of samples from 124 individuals, which produced almost 0.6 terabases of sequence in total already! From these sequences contigs are produced and ORFs are predicted, which are almost completey of bacterial origin. This then allows for the comparison of bacterial genes and genomes between the sampled individuals, and also the establishment of a 'minimal metagenome' of the gut ecosystem for absolutely required functions.</p><p>The second talk was really interesting to me: In <em><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></em> the male flies perform a courtship dance to win over the female. Barry Dickson from the Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna is looking for the genetic neurobiologic basis of this behaviour.</p><p>The fruitless gene, which produces a transcription factor, is absolutely required for the courtship of male flies; females don't produce a protein product due to alternative splicing. But when females carry the male form of the fru gene, they show the typical male courtship behaviour. This means fruitless is some kind of molecular switch for male behaviour in Drosophila by programming the nervous system. So they looked at neurons that express the fru gene with the help of reporter genes and found sensory, central and motor neurons that need to be active for male courtship. Dickson's lab was able to assemble a digital atlas of fru neurons, with stunning pictures, and were able to derive a 'wiring diagram'. Just six easy steps: Starting from fru-expressing olfactory receptor neurons that specifically sense pheromones it only takes this few neural connections to motor output in wing muscles that are required for the courtship song!</p><p>Now the group is trying to go the high throughput route by teaching a computer to analyze the courtship behaviour by itself, and the first results look very promising.</p><p>The third talk by Andrei Lupas of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, was about the genetic basis of protein fold evolution. Autonomously folding units in proteins are called domains, and usually the fold of a domain is conserved with a high evolutionary permanence.</p><p>Surprisingly for me, there are only about 10Â³ basic folds, that all were established around the time of the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms.<br>But there is the potential for a fold change in domains by specific alterations that go back to point mutations, deletions, insertions or recombination at the level of DNA. To understand how these changes come about, Lupas' group is looking at experimental changes and their outcome. For example, beta-propellers are structures that arise by repeating a single 'blade' a certain number of times. Actually, all present beta-propellers probably all go back to one ancestral blade that was amplified several times. How large can a propeller domain become? The biggest propeller in databases has 10 blades, a 14-blade propeller in yeast forms a split between blades 7 and 8. But Lupas was able to produce a 12-bladed propeller.</p>]]></content>

Yesterday was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a>, a conference about the online communication of science that took place at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.rigb.org/">Royal Institution</a>.

But I think that organizing a conference about the online communication of science is as much about how to do things, as it is about finding the right session topics. And as Science Online London is only in its second year (and the sister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonline09.com/">ScienceOnline</a> in North Carolina in its third year), there are still a lot of things we can do better.</p><h3 id="what-i-liked">What I liked</h3><p><em><em>No parallel sessions</em></em><br>Although we did have two slots with two parallel sessions each, all the other sessions were in the Faraday Theatre. I find that I always miss some great sessions in conferences with many parallel sessions. More importantly this format makes sure that everybody went to the same conference and discusses the same things. I like this because it builds a sense of community around the conference.</p><p><em><em>No unconference sessions</em></em><br>Deciding on the session topics and speakers at the beginning of the conference is a concept that worked well for similar events in the past (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">SciBarCamp Palo Alto</a>, and in part <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html">Science Blogging London 2008</a>). We decided to not use this format, which not only made the day of the conference much less stressful for the organizers, but also allowed us to have invite some interesting speakers that otherwise might not have come. This format also made it easier to have different topics and speakers from last year's conference (only 3 out of the 29 speakers also spoke last year).</p><p><em><em>Live streaming of audio and video</em></em><br>We did stream audio and video of almost all sessions to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/second-life.php">Second Life</a>. Exceptions were the session on legal and ethical aspects of blogging (which we decided not to record because of the risk that some statements could be taken as legal advice), and the breakout sessions (where we could only record audio). One speaker (Dave Munger) even gave his presentation through Second Life.</p><p>Because the Second Life users could give feedback through Second Life, Twitter or FriendFeed, this was really a virtual conference. Live video streaming (using Second Life or other technologies) should really become the norm for this kind of conference.</p><p><em><em>A perfect location</em></em><br>The Royal Institution was really a perfect place for the conference. You could argue about the pink color of the seats, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000001054">Faraday Theatre</a> has just the right size and a great of history of communicating science.</p><h3 id="what-i-didn-t-like">What I didn't like</h3><p><em><em>Not enough time in the sessions</em></em><br>We decided to go with 45 minute long sessions, and this turned out to be too short. I would have liked to have a 30 minute discussion in most sessions (some sessions worked well with shorter discussion time, e.g. <em><em>Legal and Ethical Aspects of Science Blogging</em></em>). Although there will always be session that require a different format, next time I would force speakers to limit their introduction to 15 minutes. And I would try to make the sessions 60 minutes long.</p><p><em><em>Not enough time between sessions</em></em><br>The best part of a conference is often the discussions we have between sessions. For this we should have scheduled more time, e.g. by making the coffee breaks 45 minutes long and by having a conference dinner at the beginning of the conference. But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/blog/2009/07/20/announcing-social-events-for-thursday-friday/">social events on Thursday and Friday</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/08/06/in-which-we-change-venue-fringefrivolous-blogging-unconference-2009">FringeFrivolous</a> unconference on Friday were not only interesting events, but also great for networking. Doing a conference on a single day is just too short and I would make a repeat conference a two day event. With more time I would also really like to do a brief introduction of every participant (Ã  la <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/scifoo/index.html">SciFoo</a>).</p><p><em><em>Do more moderation</em></em><br>Conferences have a tendency of always having the same people saying the same things. And discussions are sometimes more about people saying something that is dear to their heart rather than asking a question or trying to understand the other side. More moderation could help here to make the discussions more unexpected and productive.</p><p><em><em>That iPhone that just didn't stop ringing</em></em><br>Unfortunately I just couldn't pay full attention to the last part of the discussion about real-time statistics. Despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23solo09%20phone">many pleas on Twitter</a>, that iPhone must have ben ringing for at least 5 minutes.</p><p><em><em>This blog will go on summer vacation between August 27-September 20.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://network.nature.com/people/euan/profile">Euan Adie</a> in June announced the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://streamosphere.nature.com/">Streamosphere</a> service on the Nascent blog: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2009/06/welcome_to_the_streamosphere.html">Welcome to the Streamosphere</a>. His simple explanation of what Streamosphere does: </p><blockquote><em><em>Streamosphere lets you track scientific discussion on the web, in real time.</em></em> </blockquote><p>The Nascent blog post explains Streamosphere in more detail, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2009/07/streamosphere_update.html">in another post from July</a> Euan talks about some updates to the service. I've asked Euan a few questions to learn more about Streamosphere.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-explain-what-streamosphere-is-and-does">1. Can you explain what Streamosphere is and does?</h3><p>Streamosphere is an aggregator of scientific activity on the web. It tracks what scientists are talking about on Twitter, wikis, blogs, social bookmarking services, forums and other web 2.0 services.</p><h3 id="2-why-do-we-need-such-a-tool">2. Why do we need such a tool?</h3><p>I think scientific attention (any time you read an abstract, cite a paper or search for a particular gene in a database you're giving it attention) is valuable to aggregate. Traditionally scientists and publishers have measured attention with citation counts and to a lesser extent downloads but there's lots of other online activity – like blogging, commenting and bookmarking – that could be used in new metrics.</p><p>At the moment the relevant activity is</p><ul><li><em><em>distributed</em></em> people could be talking about a paper I'm interested in on Friendfeed, blogs, forums…</li><li><em><em>noisy</em></em> there are tens of thousands of research scientists on Twitter but most of the time they're posting pictures of lolcats</li><li><em><em>lacking provenance</em></em> it's not easy to know whose opinions to trust</li></ul><p>Streamosphere attempts to tackle these issues by aggregating activity from lots of different sites, removing spam, providing filters and disambiguating users on different services. If I'm interested in what other scientists think about a particular paper then I can search for it on Streamosphere. If I want to keep track of everything related to a particular field then I can do that too.</p><h3 id="3-what-is-the-difference-between-streamosphere-postgenomic-and-nature-com-blogs">3. What is the difference between Streamosphere, Postgenomic and Nature.com Blogs?</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://www.postgenomic.com/">Postgenomic</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature.com Blogs</a> only aggregate and analyze blog posts. Streamosphere gets a feed from Nature.com Blogs but covers other services too.</p><h3 id="4-what-is-the-difference-to-other-aggregators-such-as-friendfeed">4. What is the difference to other aggregators such as FriendFeed?</h3><p>The main difference is that you can't interact with content on Streamosphere – if you want to comment on a blog post or paper you have to visit it and leave your comment there.</p><p>Another would be that you don't follow people on Streamosphere, you'd follow topics.</p><h3 id="5-how-do-you-decide-whether-something-or-someone-is-related-to-science">5. How do you decide whether something or someone is related to science?</h3><p>If you bookmark or discuss things with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://www.doi.org/">DOIs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://arxiv.org/help/faq/whynostamp">arxiv IDs</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://blogs.library.ucla.edu/biomedical/2008/09/02/convert-a-pubmed-id-to-a-pubmedcentral-id/">PubMed IDs</a> then you're added to the database. At this point any of your activity that doesn't look scholarly doesn't get aggregated.</p><p>After that it's down to manual checks and whether or not you're following / being followed by other people in Streamosphere.</p><h3 id="6-can-we-follow-streamosphere-via-rss-or-twitter">6. Can we follow Streamosphere via RSS or Twitter?</h3><p>Not yet! I'm hoping to open up the data in Streamosphere via a public API that can output RSS and other formats but don't want to do it before the system is stable. There are also questions surrounding how some messages can be republished. I'm not sure if Streamosphere's API output can include the contents of any tweets, for example, as to receive streaming updates from Twitter you need to sign an agreement saying that you won't distribute them outside of your application (can't remember the exact wording).</p><p>The best way to track updates about Streamosphere is to watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123050/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/">Nascent</a>.</p><h3 id="7-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-nature-com">7. What are your responsibilities at Nature.com?</h3><p>I'm a product manager in the web publishing group. Generally speaking the areas I'm responsible for are aggregation, the Nature.com Blogs homepage and mobile platforms.</p><h3 id="8-what-did-you-do-before-working-for-nature-com">8. What did you do before working for Nature.com?</h3><p>I was a bioinformatician at the University of Edinburgh in the medical genetics unit, working on candidate disease gene prioritization.</p><p>Before that I'd co-founded and worked on a start-up that tried to extract entities and sentiment from forum posts. We brought in very little revenue for eighteen months, ran out of funding and went bust in 2001. It was an education…. 😉</p><h3 id="9-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-streamosphere">9. Do you want to talk about future plans for Streamosphere?</h3><p>Sure – the main thing I'm looking forward to is personalization – being able to log in and tell the system what you're interested in. From then on whenever you visit the site particularly relevant items will be highlighted.</p><p>The API is another key development… I'm really interested in seeing what other people can do with the data.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">SciBar Camp Palo Alto last month</a>, Peter Binfield from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/">PLoS ONE</a> gave a very interesting presentation on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://friendfeed.com/scibarcamp/3577ed2e/peter-binfield-article-level-metric-from-plos">Article-level metrics from the PLoS perspective</a>. Particularly interesting was his announcement that <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals will provide usage data (HTML pageviews, PDF and XML downloads) for all their articles in September. Usage data, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022">all measures of scientific impact</a>, have their problems, but they are a welcome addition to citation-based metrics.</p><p>I’ve interviewed Pete to ask him not only about article-level metrics, but also about the publishing model of <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> and how these two relate to each other.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-plos-one-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what PLoS ONE is and does?</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/">PLoS ONE</a> is an Open Access, scholarly, peer reviewed journal for all of science. We will be three years old in December 2009, but already we are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.com/2009/07/dramatic-growth-of-plos-one-soon-to-be.html">third largest journal (of any type) in the world</a>, publishing approximately 4,600 articles in 2009 alone and almost doubling in volume every year. We are online only (publishing in HTML, XML and PDF) and we publish daily (about 20 articles a day at present). In my view <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> is the most dynamic, innovative and exciting journal in the world, and I am proud to work on it.</p><p>In many ways <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> operates like any other journal however it diverges in several important respects. The founding principle of <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> was that there are certain aspects of publishing which are best conducted pre-publication and certain aspects which are best conducted post-publication. The advent of online publishing has allowed us to take a step back and re-evaluate these aspects of how we publish research, without the burden of centuries of tradition. In this way, we have been able to experiment with new ways of doing things which may result in dramatic improvements in the entire process of scholarly publication.</p><p>The most important thing which has come out of this premise is that unlike almost every other journal in the world, we make no judgment call whatsoever on the “impact” or “significance” or “interest level” of any submission. What this means is that if an article appropriately reports on well-conducted science, and if it passes our peer review process (which determines whether it deserves to join the scientific literature) then we will publish it. In this way, no author should ever receive the message that their article is scientifically sound but “not interesting enough” for our journal, or that their article is “only suited to a specialized audience”. As a result, we short circuit the vicious cycle of submit to a “top tier” journal; get reviewed; get rejected; submit to the next journal down the list; repeat until accepted and we are therefore able to place good science into the public domain as promptly as possible, with the minimum of burden on the academic community.</p><p>The most recent example of the way in which we separate pre-publication activity from post-publication activity is with the development of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://everyone.plos.org/tag/article-level-metrics/">Article-Level Metrics program</a>. <em><em>Article-level metrics</em></em> start from the assumption that the best way to measure the worth of an article is to look at the actual article itself (and not the journal it happens to have been published in). Following from this, it seems obvious that the best way to evaluate any article is to make use of the collective opinion of all experts in the field (and not a small number of peer reviewers, or a small number of people who ultimately go on to cite the article). An evaluation of this type (which requires that people actually read, and then act in a variety of ways, on the article) can only be done after the article is published (and not before, as happens when a journal rejects a paper because it thinks it is not “impactful” enough). Therefore, our development of new tools to facilitate the post-publication evaluation of individual articles is a great example of us separating out what is most appropriately conducted pre-publication vs post-publication.</p><p>I have gone into some detail on these issues in a recent peer reviewed paper – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://conferences.aepic.it/index.php/elpub/elpub2009/paper/view/114">PLoS One: background, future development, and article-level metrics</a> and I would also recommend Shirley Wu’s excellent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://shirleywho.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/the-evolution-of-scientific-impact/">recent blog post on this topic</a>.</p><h3 id="2-can-you-describe-what-ambra-topaz-is-and-does">2. Can you describe what Ambra/Topaz is and does?</h3><p>Basically Ambra is our publishing platform, which runs on top of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/13/all-plos-titles-now-on-the-same-publishing-platform/">Topaz</a> infrastructure. For the full technical detail, the best information is found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://ambraproject.org/">here</a>.</p><h3 id="3-can-you-talk-a-little-bit-more-about-the-post-publication-features-of-ambra-topaz">3. Can you talk a little bit more about the post-publication features of Ambra/Topaz?</h3><p>Once an article is published, our platform allows users to leave feedback directly on the article. We were among the first journals to allow this, and we remain somewhat unique in this respect, although the concept is gaining broader acceptance and similar functionality is starting to appear at other publishers sites. Specifically, we allow users to leave a Note inline with a specific selection of text; or they can leave a general Comment on the entire article; or they can Star rate the article (on a 5 point scale in 3 categories). Comments and Notes form discussion threads, and users can then engage in debate on the points raised.</p><p>Users may not be anonymous, they must follow our guidelines for civilized academic debate, and when leaving feedback they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/static/commentGuidelines.action">asked to declare any competing interests</a>. I want to make it clear that the post-publication functionality that we provide is not intended to provide post-publication peer review – it is post-publication discourse and feedback. All <em><em>PLoS</em></em> titles now share this same functionality.</p><h3 id="4-are-other-publishers-besides-plos-using-the-ambra-topaz-platform">4. Are other publishers besides PLoS using the Ambra/Topaz platform?</h3><p>None that we are aware of although the NIH has an internal project. But Topaz is open source, so please contact us if you want to use it!</p><h3 id="5-what-article-level-metrics-does-plos-one-provide">5. What article-level metrics does PLoS ONE provide?</h3><p>As of today (August 2009), on every article, in every <em><em>PLoS</em></em> title we provide:</p><ul><li>Number of citations (as measured by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMedCentral</a>)</li><li>Number of social bookmarks (as recorded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>)</li><li>Number of star ratings left by users on our system</li><li>Notes, Comments and any replies, as left by users of our system</li><li>Number of blog posts written about the article (as counted by the blog aggregators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.postgenomic.com/">Postgenomic</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature Blogs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>)</li><li>Specific trackbacks to the article from any web page using our trackback protocol</li></ul><p>In September we will be adding additional citation data as measured by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> and, most significantly, the online usage for each article (going back to the original publication date and reported on a monthly basis, broken down by HTML pageviews, PDF downloads, and XML downloads). This development in particular is very exciting – no other publisher has made this data available for such a large corpus of articles.</p><p>After this, the next data source we will add will be blog coverage as aggregated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging.org</a>, and in subsequent months we will be adding other metrics as and when we can identify high quality sources which meet our criteria.</p><p><em><em>Article-level metrics</em></em> are a major development for <em><em>PLoS</em></em> and we believe that we are unique in the publishing industry with the transparent provision of such a range of <em><em>article-level metrics</em></em>. No other publisher provides as much (or any, in most cases) article-level data in such a comprehensive and open manner. It is our belief that once we have demonstrated what is possible, as well as the power of these metrics, the academic community will quickly begin to expect, and demand, this level of information from all journals. As a result the very nature of research reporting and evaluation will be improved as a result.</p><h3 id="6-how-do-article-level-metrics-fit-in-with-how-plos-one-conducts-peer-review">6. How do article-level metrics fit in with how PLoS ONE conducts peer review</h3><p>We peer review all submissions for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/static/review.action">scientific content</a>, but we do NOT peer review them in order to determine whether they are high or low impact (or interest or significance or relevance etc). Therefore, from the reader’s point of view, when you encounter a <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> article you do not necessarily know how impactful, or interesting, or significant, or relevant that article might be (without actually reading it!). In the traditional model, you would have some indication as to the likely importance of an article by a knowledge of the journal in which it was published in (although we argue that this way of determining quality is actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plos.org/cms/node/478">one of the worst methods you could use</a>), however in <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> all you know is that the article is scientifically and methodologically sound (which are the only questions that our peer review process asks). Therefore, <em><em>article-level metrics</em></em> provide the reader with an indication as to the worth of an article once it is published. Until today, people have effectively said: this article was published in journal X, therefore knowing this one fact, I now know that the article is excellent/good/average/poor. I think that any sane person who considered that statement would realize how unscientific it was. With the advent of <em><em>article-level metrics</em></em>, a reader can now say “this article was published as part of the scientific literature, it is irrelevant which journal it was published in as I have now been given a variety of information about the article itself which will help me decide whether the article is excellent / good / average / poor for my own purposes”.</p><p>Therefore, <em><em>article-level metrics</em></em> do not supplant peer review and they also do not represent post-publication peer review. However they do provide the reader with new and valuable ways to do the post-publication evaluation and filtering of journal content.</p><h3 id="7-what-are-plos-one-subject-areas-or-portals">7. What are PLoS ONE subject areas or portals?</h3><p>We actually have several ways to ‘parse’ our content by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/static/browse.action">topic</a>: All content is assigned to one or more of our 52 topic areas (for example Pathology or Oncology). These topics are assigned by the authors themselves and an article can appear in more than one topic. Having made that classification, readers can then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action">browse the topics</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/static/rssFeeds.action">an RSS feed per topic</a>.</p><p>However, we appreciate that this is not a very flexible way to find content that doesn’t easily fall under our existing taxonomy structure. Therefore, we also have the ability to aggregate our articles into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/article/browseVolume.action">Collections</a>. A Collection is literally just an aggregation tool (post-publication) – articles are still published as part of the normal run of the journal, but can then be assigned to join a Collection where they will also appear as part of a collection of related articles. For example, right now we have a very popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pone.c01.i02">Paleontology Collection</a>. As we publish new Paleontology articles they get added to this Collection to form a single location for all relevant articles in the field. This Collection functionality can also be used for the output of a single research effort, and an example of this is our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pone.c01.i01">Stress-Induced Depression and Comorbidities Collection</a> which effectively replicated a “Special Issue” of a journal, and contained all the articles we published as written by the EUMOOD Research Consortia. Collections can be static, or can build up over time, and articles can appear in multiple Collections – as such they represent a very flexible way to re-present our content.</p><p>Then we have <em><em>PLoS</em></em> Hubs, which are under development right now. We see a Hub as a way to aggregate journal articles (along with other types of content) about a given topic into a single location. Once aggregated, we can then provide various community specific tools and services around this content. A Hub should not be thought of as a portal or an overlay journal – the distinguishing feature will be that a Hub will physically contain (and not just link out to) as much content as possible. Clearly, the easiest way to achieve this is by making the content Open Access, and so we also see Hubs as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of an Open Access copyright license. At the moment there is only one Hub (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://clinicaltrials.ploshubs.org/home.action">PLoS Clinical Trials Hub</a>) but this is a rather old implementation of the concept and only contains <em><em>PLoS</em></em> content – therefore we are proactively working on a new release which will include more of the functionality described above.</p><p>Future developments to our platform will involve the ability to tag articles (perhaps by some combination of curated and user generated tags) which will provide yet another way to dynamically aggregate the content.</p><h3 id="8-how-has-the-ambra-topaz-platform-handled-the-enormous-growth-of-plos-one">8. How has the Ambra/Topaz platform handled the enormous growth of PLoS ONE?</h3><p>Great! We had a few architecture issues in the past due to the bleeding edge nature of the platform, but all seven of our journals have now migrated to the same platform and no substantial issues have come up since the we migrated our Community Journals (back in early 2008).</p><h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-plos">9. What are your responsibilities at PLoS?</h3><p>I am the Managing Editor of <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> (one of seven titles at <em><em>PLoS</em></em>). Although this position is an Editorial one, it is the position which is ultimately responsible for everything associated with the journal. By this I mean that although other departments may not report into me, I am ultimately responsible for the marketing, production, operations, web etc of the journal. If we have a problem with any aspect of the journal, it is me that makes sure it gets solved!</p><h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-at-plos">10. What did you do before starting to work at PLoS?</h3><p>Well, I am a physicist from way back – I have a first degree in Physics with Astrophysics and a PhD in Underwater Optical Holography (which I always tell people sounds a lot more interesting than it was!). After my PhD I realized I wasn’t interested in a life in academia and so I moved into Academic Publishing, which allowed me to stay in touch with academia and also to interact with leading researchers conducting the latest research. I started out at Institute of Physics Publishing, in Bristol UK, doing book acquisitions, then I moved to Holland to work for Kluwer Academic Publishers (KAP) to start up a reference work program for them. Via a series of moves I ended up running the KAP Earth, Environmental and Plant Sciences division – a large portfolio of books, reference works and journals in those areas. Around the time that KAP merged with Springer I moved into Business Development for a year or so, which was an interesting period working on Springer’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002113207/http://www.springer.com/open+access/open+choice">Open Choice</a> program, online reference works and journal acquisitions among others. Then I left Springer, and also Holland, to move to California (my wife is from San Diego) where I worked for SAGE Publications, just North of LA, for 3 years. There I ran the SAGE US Journals division, which was made up of some 200 or so journals, mostly in the Social Sciences. In that position a large part of the job involved bidding on society titles, to publish them under contract. And then, finally, in March 2008 I moved to San Francisco, to work for <em><em>PLoS</em></em> and run <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em>.</p><h3 id="11-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-ambra-topaz">11.

For this go to the webpage for the paper you want to discuss (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08237.html">this paper</a>) and then use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet">FriendFeed bookmarklet</a> to announce the paper (and additional information such as the date of the journal club) in the <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> group. If the copyright of the paper allows this, you could also post the fulltext PDF of the paper to the <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> group.</p><p>Use <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> comments to capture the discussion about the paper in the journal club. The comments can also contain links to other relevant papers and the slides you may have prepaped for the journal club. This is helpful for those unable to attend the journal club in person, or to look back at the journal club a few months later.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://network.nature.com/forums">Nature Network forums</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://www.labmeeting.com/">Labmeeting</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe_distributing_papers_for_a_journal_club/http//www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> (and probably some other tools) offer similar functionality, so use the service you are most comfortable with. Of the tools mentioned, <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> for me is the easiest to set up and use.</p><h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3><p>Email is not a good solution for regularly sending around large files. And discussions among a larger group of people (i.e. all members of a journal club) are difficult to follow via email. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> is a good alternative without these limitations, but is not yet publicly available.</p><p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://openwetware.org/wiki/Journal_Club">Wiki</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://blogs.nature.com/nature/journalclub/">blog</a> could also be used to organize a journal club, but requires a larger effort to set up and maintain.</p><p>Many reference managers allow their users to create private groups for sharing references. But in order to work as a tool for a journal club, we also need messages/comments. Not only to discuss the paper, but simply to provide the date and presenter for the journal club or other organisational information. But I wouldn't be surprised if more reference managers besides <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> add these features in the future.</p><p>If all journal club papers should automatically be stored in a reference manager, use either <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> or put the papers for the journal club first into the reference manager and then export them via RSS feed into <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>. This step can be automated if you create a group/folder for the journal club in your reference manager.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Regular readers of this blog know that I often talk about bibliographic management tools (most recently <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/what-is-the-right-reference-manager-for-you">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/reference-manager-overview">here</a>), and it was probably for this reason that I was invited to an interesting full-day workshop last week at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/">Royal Free Hospital Medical Library</a> in London: <em><em>Bibliographic Management meets Web 2.0</em></em>. The event was organized by science librarians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://network.nature.com/people/franknorman/profile">Frank Norman</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://network.nature.com/people/UB5280986/profile">Nathalie Cornee</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://network.nature.com/people/U8136B832/profile">Betsy Anagnostelis</a>, and was attended by about 20 science librarians. We had demos of the following software:</p><ul><li><a href="https://endnote.com/">EndnoteWeb</a>, demo by Stephanie Marshall</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a>, demo by Aaron Maierhofer</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connotea">Connotea</a>, demo by Grace Barnes</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteULike">CiteULike</a>, demo by Kevin Emamy</li><li><a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, demo by Rintze Zelle</li><li><a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, demo by Victor Henning and Jan Reichelt</li></ul><p>This is a fairly complete list of bibliographic software with Web 2.0 features. Missing are some tools with similar features, as there simply wasn't enough time and money to invite them all (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.2collab.com/">2collab</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.labmeeting.com/">Labmeeting</a>), several popular programs without these features (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.refman.com/">Reference Manager</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.citavi.com/">Citavi</a> and <a href="https://www.papersapp.com/">Papers</a>), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://jabref.sourceforge.net/">JabRef</a> and similar tools for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> files used by LaTeX.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/3774951723_0b9e697677.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="500" height="315"></figure><p>I gave a brief introduction of what features I would look for in a reference manager today (available on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.slideshare.net/mfenner/which-reference-manager">slideshare</a>). The six presenters then took up a challenge (Word file <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://friendfeed-media.com/f9221d4c733652d64845e3dc6e0c17eaea9a05a2">here</a>) that was given to them the week before. We used a simplified version of a set of tasks (find reference, put citation into Word document, etc.) originally developed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://citefest.pbworks.com/">CiteFest</a> at Northwestern University. Every participant was sitting in front of a computer and follow along with the tasks (the technical staff at the Royal Free did a marvelous job installing the software and bookmarklets on all computers before the workshop). The demos were nicely captured in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://friendfeed.com/bibman2">FriendFeed room</a> we have set up for the workshop, so you can follow the details of the sessions there (the room also has some excellent links to other resources).</p><p>In the discussion at the end we all felt that all reference managers used that day were up to the challenge (<em><em>Connotea</em></em> and <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> couldn't put references into a Word document, but managed the rest of the tasks perfectly), and we decided not to declare a winner. We also felt that the market is developing so fast, that a feature comparison looked very different 12 months ago (e.g. <em><em>Mendeley</em></em> just launched, no Web version of <em><em>Zotero</em></em>), and will again look very different 12 months from today. Most librarians in the room therefore felt that they probably have to support most of these tools at their institutions. We briefly talked about the cost of these tools (of the tools that were demoed, only <em><em>Endnoteweb</em></em> and <em><em>Refworks</em></em> are commercial). This might be an issue when licenses have to be renewed. I've set up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/15/reference-manager-overview">reference manager feature comparison chart</a> a few months ago, and have updated this chart after the workshop.</p><p>One feature I really like in <em><em>Papers</em></em> is full-text search of the PDF files in your library, which I think is a much easier way to find information than tagging (and David Crotty agrees with me: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.cshblogs.org/cshprotocols/2009/02/23/why-article-tagging-doesnt-work/">Why article tagging doesn't work</a>). I was therefore happy to see that <em><em>Zotero</em></em>, <em><em>Mendeley</em></em>, <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> and <em><em>Refworks</em></em> all support this feature, something I have overlooked before. Full-text search is one more reason that online reference managers should be able to store PDF files. Another reason is that several people working on the same research project shouldn't all have to go out and download the full-text files themselves – or even worse, email them to each other. This sharing is not only an important features of Web 2.0 bibliographic tools, but is obviously also an area of potential problems with copyright (for papers that are not Open Access). <em><em>CiteULike</em></em>, <em><em>Mendeley</em></em> and <em><em>Refworks</em></em> all try to avoid these kinds of issues by allowing sharing of references and PDF files in private groups with a limited number of users.</p><p>It was interesting to see that the tools use very different approaches to integrate with the Web. <em><em>Connotea</em></em>, <em><em>CiteUlike</em></em> and <em><em>Refworks</em></em> are Web-based tools (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.refworks.com/refworks/WNCDownload.asp">Refworks Write-N-Cite Windows module</a> can download the reference database for read-only offline use), whereas <em><em>Zotero</em></em>, <em><em>Mendeley</em></em> and <em><em>Endnote</em></em> synchronize between a desktop version and web version. I'm really torn between these two approaches. Web-only reduces the cost of development and maintenance (no need to develop separate versions for Web/Windows/Mac/Linux, users don't have to install new versions). Desktop/Web allows offline use users always have a copy of their data on their computer. There is probably no right answer to this, email is another example where both approaches are very successful.</p><p>Only after the meeting did I realize another interesting difference between the various tools. They all have different business models behind them: <em><em>Endnoteweb</em></em>: (mostly) single-user licenses, <em><em>Refworks</em></em>: site licenses, <em><em>Connotea</em></em>: owned by a publisher, <em><em>CiteUlike</em></em>: independent with support from a publisher, <em><em>Zotero</em></em>: Open Source and <em><em>Mendeley</em></em>: Web 2.0 company that plans free and paid services. This might actually be a deciding factor in determining which of these tools will be the most successful in the long-term future.</p><p>But in the end, the similarities far outweigh the differences between these tools. We didn't have time left to talk more about this, but for Bibliographic Management to move to Web 2.0, it's not really just about technology, but rather mostly about the users. We had an interesting discussion about that topic a few weeks ago (<a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/how-to-close-the-digital-divide-among-scientists">How to close the digital divide among scientists</a>). I believe that ultimately your collection of references should sit in a database that is accessible from the web. Some references you want to share with everybody (e.g. via tools like FriendFeed), and that includes your own publications. And some references you want to share with private groups of people, e.g. people in your lab or when coauthoring a paper. All the tools presented in the workshop allow you to do that.</p>]]></content>

The link to his application is broken, but his idea was that research articles are non-linear and he provided customized interfaces on how the article is presented.</li></ul><p>This week Cell Press and Elsevier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authored_newsitem.cws_home/companynews05_01279">announced</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://beta.cell.com/">Article of the Future</a> project, again a project on how scientific articles should be presented online. It is not clear of how the material submitted in the Article 2.0 contest was used to create the Article of the Future prototypes. Some key features of the prototypes are:</p><ul><li>Tabbed browsing of article sections</li><li>hierarchical presentation of text and figures</li><li>graphical abstract and research highlights</li><li>integrated audio and video</li><li>real-time reference analyses</li></ul><p>Two sample articles are provided by Cell Press (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://beta.cell.com/erickson/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://beta.cell.com/hochstim/">here</a>). They are a good starting point to discuss what works and what doesn't. And I don't want to get into the discussion of whether naming this project <em><em>Article of the Future</em></em> is a little bit overambitious for the small changes that were proposed in the prototypes. Here are my thoughts on some of the features that might be useful in displaying research articles online (a lot of them have already been implemented by one journal or another):</p><h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3><p>Navigation to a specific section (e.g. discussion) is an obvious feature that many journals have implemented. This navigation should also work as links from the outside, and should also allow direct linking to a figure or table.</p><h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3><p>The traditional abstract can be extended for the online version of a manuscript. This could be an easier to read summary of the article or an audio or video abstract. Abstracts are important teasers to read the fulltext paper, and the current format might not be appropriate for everyone.</p><h3 id="integration-of-figures-and-tables">Integration of figures and tables</h3><p>Most journals don't fully integrate figures and tables in their online papers, but rather put them on a separate page and link to them. This is similar to the PDF version of a paper, where figures often have to be placed away from the text section discussing them. The online version of a paper should allow viewing the figures and tables in parallel to reading the next, preferably by using a two column layout. Supplementary information should be integrated in a similar manner.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Going back and forth between the citation in the text and the reference at the end of the article is one of the annoyances of the traditional paper format. Online papers should make this easier, e.g. by displaying the full reference when hovering over the citation. A separate column for the references could also work, but three columns (text, figures, and references) might confuse the typical reader. The reference section should include links to the referenced paper, preferably using the DOI. Additional information about these references (e.g. links to PubMed, links to the full text, number of citations) could also be provided. A “return to text” is a nice touch at <em><em>Biomed Central</em></em>.</p><h3 id="related-content">Related content</h3><p>Other papers citing the article should be listed and linked to. Showing related articles would be helpful, but I have yet to see a working implementation of that feature (maybe with the help of services such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.citulike.org/">CiteULike</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>?). A good starting point would be to include other articles by the same authors and articles that are cited by the paper. Links to blog posts and other online content (e.g. on <em><em>Twitter</em></em> or <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>) talking about the article would be very helpful, but that is difficult to do. Linking to the places that bookmark the article (e.g. on <em><em>CiteULike</em></em>, <em><em>Connotea</em></em>, <em><em>2collab</em></em>) is a good starting point to find other users with related interests. Therefore it is also helpful to make it easy to share the article using these services (as they all use bookmarklets for that, this is more about providing good import filters).</p><h3 id="article-publication-history">Article Publication History</h3><p>The publication history of the article (submission and acceptance dates, as well as reviewer comments, etc.) provides interesting addition information about a paper, and is for example provided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/9/127/prepub">BioMed Central journals</a>.</p><h3 id="comments-and-usage-statistics">Comments and usage statistics</h3><p>Comments should be possible not only at the end of the article, but also within specific sections (such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.plosone.org/static/commentGuidelines.action">notes</a> in PLoS journals). And comments should be implemented using an API, allowing viewing and adding comments from within other services. Usage statistics are another way to look at the popularity of a paper, and should soon be available for the <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals.</p><h3 id="semantic-markup">Semantic markup</h3><p>This is an area where I would expect the biggest changes to the current format – papers currently have little or no support for this and that is a shame. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/pub/2008/plospaper/latest/">Here</a> is an example of a semantically enhanced PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases article. Another example is semantic markup used by <em><em>Nature Chemistry</em></em>, as discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2009/03/nature-chemistry-improves-publishing.html">this blog post</a> by Egon Willighagen.</p><p>Kent Anderson over at the <em><em>scholarly kitchen blog</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/07/21/the-article-of-the-future-lipstick-on-a-pig/">The Article of the Future – Just Lipstick Again?</a>) and Marshall Kirkpatrick at <em><em>ReadWriteWeb</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/elseviers_prototype_is_this_the_scientific_article.php">Elsevier's Prototype: Is This The Scientific Article of the Future?</a>) also wrote about this.

The problem is, Wave is currently only available to selected developers, and will not be generally available until the end of the year. Wave is currently not even beta software and was announced now so that third-party developers have enough time to build (and test) extensions to Wave.</p><p>Those of us being invited to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174142/http://www.nature.com/scifoo/index.html">SciFoo</a> (which took place July 10-12 at Google) were lucky not only in attending a great conference, but also in getting a Wave account. Wave product manager <em><em>Steph Hannon</em></em> gave us an introduction to Wave on the first evening, and <em><em>Cameron Neylon</em></em> organized a session about Wave the next day. The session was mainly about the Wave extensions that we scientists would need (and I'm sure that Cameron will blog about that), but we could also ask two developers from the Wave team a lot of questions.</p><p>After using Wave for one week, I obviously have a much better feeling for how it can help scientists to communicate and collaborate. The best way to start is to think of Wave as email on steroids. Wave is web-based (which means that it currently only works when you have an internet connection) with a nice interface similar to Gmail or other webmail products. One big advantage over email is that all reply messages are directly connected to the original message (similar to comments on a blog). This is especially helpful for longer email threads and when more than two people are involved.</p><p>But Wave is also instant messaging. You see a small green dot next to your contacts that are currently online, and you can see them typing in real-time (which looks really creepy the first time you see that).</p><p>And Wave is also like a Wiki. You can not only respond to a message, but everybody participating in the Wave can also change the original message (and several people can work on the same message simultaneously). This works great for things such as listing all the blog posts about SciFoo.</p><p>The combination of wiki-style editing plus comments make Wave an interesting alternative to project management tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174142/http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>. And this means that Wave can also be used to work on longer documents – something that the Wave developers regularly do for documentation, etc. Wave documents can also contain images, videos, links, etc. Wave supports different fonts, text colors, bold and italic text, and four different heading levels (for titles and subtitles).</p><p>But in contrast to most online collaboration tools, Wave can be extended with additional functionality that scientists require. Bibliographic references would be an obvious example, and here tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174142/http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174142/http://buzzword.acrobat.com/">Adobe Buzzword</a> fall short.</p><p>Wave extensions come in the form of gadgets (that work on the client) and robots (that work on the server). Wave gadgets are XML files, whereas robots can currently be developed in either Java or Python. Other programming languages (PHP, Ruby, Perl, etc.) for robots will soon become possible when robots no longer have to be hosted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174142/http://code.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a>. Using the tools provided by Google, writing a robot is actually not that difficult and it took me only an hour to have a sample “Hello World!” robot running in Wave. It will obviously take weeks or months to develop more sophisticated robots (e.g. for management of bibliographic references), but I'm sure that a number of exciting science-related extensions will be ready by the time Wave becomes publicly available later this year.</p><p>We plan a session with a live Wave demo at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174142/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a> conference in August so that more scientists and science communicators become familiar with Wave. About 10 people that registered for the conference already have Wave accounts and I hope that some of them will come up with interesting science-related robots or gadgets. If you are a Wave user, you can reach me at mfenner@wavesandbox.com. And if you want to develop great science-related extensions for Wave, please contact <em><em>Cameron Neylon</em></em>.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2009-07-13T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I was at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107033419/http://www.nature.com/scifoo/everything.html">SciFoo</a>, an invitation-only unconference by <em>O'Reilly Media</em>, <em>Nature</em> and <em>Google</em> that took place at Google. I was fortunate to be invited, and I'm still digesting all the impressions and discussions that I had (there were <em>many</em>). This post is the indirect result of two sessions and several related discussions on one particular topic that I'm most interested in – the process of scientific publication.</p><p>Peer review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107033419/http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/index.html">is usually seen as essential</a> for the quality of a published paper. At the same time peer review puts a large burden of work on the research community, and in general is unpaid work. But peer review is not living up to its full potential. We should start to see it not as a necessary, costly and time-consuming burden, but rather as a business opportunity. But for this the information communicated in the peer review process needs to leave the (digital) drawers of the journal editorial offices.</p><p>The published research paper is the most important piece of information used to evaluate the reputation of a scientist (the published book takes that role in many social sciences). This evaluation is most important when large sums of money and the personal careers of the involved scientists (in the form of research grants and jobs) depend on it. We usually begin with applying some sort of metrics to the publications of the scientist(s) under evaluation, most often the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107033419/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/free/essays/">Journal Impact Factor</a>. Once we have reduced the number of scientists and papers to a small enough number, we can start reading the full-text papers in order to evaluate the quality of the science. Both approaches have shortcomings that I don't want to go into detail here (citation metric: artificial number, delay of several years if relying on citation counts; reading full-text paper: time constraints, often needs outside experts as science has become so specialized). The information contained in the peer review process is a large untapped resource that could potentially overcome many of these shortcomings.</p><p>The typical revenue streams of a scientific journal are currently subscriptions and author submission fees, and to a lesser extend advertising and subscription-based added value in the form of news items and editorials. The information contained in the peer review process is extremely valuable to granting agencies and job search committees and has the potential to become an additional major revenue source for scientific journals, thus allowing a reduction in author submission fees and/or free full-text access without a subscription. Many research organizations and funding agencies currently pay for journal subscriptions and author submission fees. If they would pay the journal publishers similar amounts of money for peer review information, they would obviously get much more value out of their money. Whereas this revenue would probably come mainly from granting agencies, large research organizations or companies would also pay for this information, as would the typical academic journal reader (obviously a much smaller sum) if it helps in filtering out the most relevant scientific papers.</p><p>The peer review process obviously would have to change in this model. If peer review becomes a major source of revenue for the journals, reviewers need to get paid for their efforts. And it will affect of what reviewers and editors write in their assessment if that information might later be seen by third parties – even if they remain anonymous. It is also not clear if the peer review information of rejected papers should be used (a large body of information at journals with high rejection rates). And if journal publishers don't buy in that model of selling peer review information, nobody stops other parties from doing additional peer review of papers already published and selling that information. Which sounds pretty much like what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107033419/http://www.f1000biology.com/">Faculty of 1000</a> is doing, although they seem to be targeting the academic journal reader rather than the much more important funding agencies.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2009-07-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><br><a href="http://www.scibarcamp.org/SciBarCamp_Palo_Alto">SciBarCamp Palo Alto</a> took place July 8-9 in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://www.iftf.org/">Institute for the Future</a>. I came right from the airport and arrived too late for the general introductions and session suggestions. But there was time for a little break before Sean Mooney started his keynote lecture.</p><h3 id="keynote-biomedical-research-in-the-age-of-cyberinfrastructure"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ff.im/4YEeQ">Keynote: Biomedical Research in the Age of Cyberinfrastructure</a></h3><p>Sean Mooney</p><p>Sean Mooney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://www.buckinstitute.org/theInstitute/news.asp?id=31">just recently joined the Buck Institute for Age Research</a> as director of their bioinformatics core. He was talking both about his extensive experience building web-based bioinformatics tools, but also about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://laboratree.org/">Laboratree</a>, a social networking tool for scientists with a focus on research management. The key argument he was trying to make is that we have a large number of online tools to store and analyze the data of our scientific experiments, but that there is still not enough effort to connect these tools. The infrasctructure networks that exist (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/">caBIG</a>) usually focus on one particular domain (cancer research in this case), and the 27 NIH institutes all have their own approach to informatics. Researchers and administrators have a very different approach to online tools. Whereas researchers want to analyze data, administrators focus more on the much broader picture, e.g. asset management. Administrators often misjudge their needs for the needs of the scientist. Scientists often mistake today's needs for tomorrow's needs.</p><p>Sean also talked about his experience building <em>Laboratree</em>. He thinks that the social networking for scientists killer app is one that people “have to use” not “like to use”, and that successful tools are simple and start with a preexisting community.</p><p>After the keynote we had un-dinner in smaller groups, and I went to bed after being up for 24 hours thanks to the 9 hour time difference. The next day we had the unconference sessions suggested the day before, and I talk a little bit about the sessions I attended. The rest of the sessions are well documented in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://friendfeed.com/scibarcamp">SciBarCamp FriendFeed group</a> and on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23sbcPA">Twitter</a>.</p><h3 id="open-source-textbooks"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ff.im/50EdW">Open Source Textbooks</a></h3><p>Chris Patil</p><p>This was a great brainstorming session. We agreed that – with very few exceptions – there is no financial incentive for scientists to write textbooks. The main motivation is reputation, and we thought that the lack of return on textbook authoring is an opportunity for new approaches. The concept of Open Access textbooks is a social problem (e.g. who pays for the textbook, what are the author incentives when there is a long list of contributors), and not a technical problem. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm">OpenCourseWare</a> was mentioned as a great educational resource that overlaps in intent with Open Access textbooks. Sean Mooney and Cameron Neylon mention the often unsolved copyright issues when creating Open Access material, and this includes potential issues with proper attribution with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license when reusing material. We briefly talked about document formats (where PDF probably is still important), and that we probably need to print most of the textbooks, at least until eBook readers become cheaper.</p><h3 id="personal-genomics"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ff.im/50N35">Personal Genomics</a></h3><p>Melanie Swan</p><p>This for me was a great introduction to the topic, and the main emphasis of the session was probably on the consumer perspective. The first ever consumer genomics conference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://www.consumergeneticsshow.com/">was held in Boston last month</a>. One important, and still only partly solved issue is huge amount of data generated, especially if we take into account not only genetics, but also epigenetic changes, and the fact that not all cells of an individual are genetically identical (which is true especially in cancer). The technology is changing rapidly and the cost of sequencing a whole genome of an individual is constantly coming down. We talked about a few examples of genes that are already useful to test, one prominent example being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://rbaltman.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/cms-made-a-mistake-in-not-approving-genetics-for-warfarin/">CYP2C9</a> and warfarin (an anticoagulant) metabolism. Many chronic disease conditions are multigenetic, and therefore it is usually risk assessment rather than yes/no answers. Some personalized genetics testing companies are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://www.navigenics.com/">Navigenics</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://www.decode.com/">Decode</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/https://www.23andme.com/">23andMe</a>.</p><h3 id="article-level-metric-from-the-plos-perspective"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ff.im/50Wty">Article level metric from the PLoS perspective</a></h3><p>Peter Binfield</p><p>Peter started the session by addressing the problem: how do you access the worth of impact of journal articles, and at what level do we measure this: journal, research institution, individual researcher? he then went over currently used article level metrics that fall into six areas:</p><ul><li>citation metrics</li><li>usage metrics</li><li>expert rankings (Faculty of 1000)</li><li>Conversations (blogs, media coverage, comments)</li><li>social bookmarking (citeULike etc)</li><li>Other cool stuff (geotagging of authors, etc.)</li></ul><p>In this broader context article-level metrics can be seen as post-publication peer review. Much of this is still ongoing, ResearchBlogging.org is for example bulding an API so that blog posts about PLoS articles can be tracked. In August PLoS One will add information about usage statistics to all their papers. Because usage statistics are currently not widely available, this give a push to the role of usage statistics in evaluating a paper. Future work at PLoS will include better integration with Mendeley, Zotero, CiteULike and similar services. We briefly talked about the relative little use of commenting and tagging at PLoS One, and some people in the audience felt that we need automated tools (e.g. by looking at what papers are bookmarked or stored in Mendeley) rather than user generated content.</p><h3 id="spinning-science-the-good-and-the-bad-of-media-sensationalism"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ff.im/51cld">Spinning Science: The good and the bad of media sensationalism</a></h3><p><em>Naomi Most, Kiki Sanford</em></p><p>Naomi and Kiki started the session by putting up the provocative hypothesis that sensationalism is the way to report science. They cite Edwin Slosson who in 1921 said <em>Our best plan is probably to try to crowd out falsehood by truth and to present scientific information in a way that will be at least as attractive as the misinformation that now holds the field.</em> They point out that there are different realms of science communication, including</p><ul><li>science for scientists</li><li>science for scientists working in different fields</li><li>science for the educated public</li><li>science for students, and more</li></ul><p>We probably need more translators of science, rather than more people doing science. We are already overwhelmed with the massive amount of science created today. We had a longer discussion about the misunderstandings between scientists and their institution's PR people. Part of the problem is that scientists are not automatically good communicators. Should they all become good communicators? This is probably not possible and not required. We then talked about science rock stars and had the best quote of the meeting:</p><blockquote><em>Why do kids look up more to basketball players rather than scientists? They are taller.</em> (Jim Hardy)</blockquote><h3 id="scientific-publishing-in-5-10-years"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ff.im/51jI5">Scientific Publishing in 5-10 years</a></h3><p>Peter Binfield</p><p>This was a fun session of what we think science publishing will look like in the intermediate future. Peter asked the following questions:</p><ul><li>Do current publishers exist?</li><li>Does the journal exist as a package?</li><li>Does the article exist?</li><li>What business models dominate?</li><li>What new technical features do we seriously expect?</li><li>What new modes of scholarly communication may gain wide acceptance?</li></ul><p>Other questions that were asked by the audience include:</p><ul><li>What money exists in 5-10 years?</li><li>Who is doing the actual work of publishing?</li><li>What are the customers?</li></ul><p>We went through most of these points. We discussed a possible business model similar to iTunes where the per-article charges would be much lower than today. In the future the role of the librarian will change. It will be more about information, and less about journal subscriptions. We talked about how the process of producing and publishing a paper will become cheaper by better tools, and by using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM-DTD</a> standard for submission. Articles in the future will not contain only text and figures, and we had a longer discussion on how digital media can be preserved in the long run, and that at some point we will not be able to keep all our data because of the dramatic increase in the carbon footprint required.</p><h3 id="efficiency-and-incentives-in-research-how-to-bend-the-internet-to-scientists"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://ff.im/51tx6">Efficiency and incentives in research – How to bend the internet to scientists</a></h3><p>Cameron Neylon, Jason Hoyt, Duncan Hull</p><p>The last session was really three separate little presentations by the three speakers. Cameron started with a presentation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://www.slideshare.net/CameronNeylon/nesta-science-in-society">he recently gave at NESTA</a> (Science in Society). One question he asked was how we maximise the efficiency in generating impact for our research? Jason Hoyt gave a good introduction to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> and used this as a basis of what social tools for scientists should look like. One important point: these tools should work with a userbase of 1, rather than needing a critical mass. Duncan Hull talked about Digital Identity on the Web, something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110193313/http://duncan.hull.name/2009/06/02/who-are-you/">he has talked about before</a>. He pointed out that many papers in Google Scholar are by “forgotten password”, “already registered”, etc. OpenID is a solution to some of the problems of author identity, but is complicated to use and not secure enough for some specific scientific applications. Peter Binfield explained that an author identifier would be really helpful for PLoS, and that their databases currently can't identify an author that has for example changed institutions. We had a long discussion about potential benefits of researcher identifiers, and what is needed to really get the ball rolling.</p><p>After the final session I went to the pub with a few people (really strange to do that in Palo Alto), and after having some food hopped on the bus that brought me back to my hotel.</p>]]></content>

Almost all journals now provide their TOC as RSS feed that is updated with every new issue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> is a standard web format used to publish frequently updated works. A journal article RSS feed usually contains one item for every article, each with title, authors, abstract and link to the fulltext article. To subscribe to the RSS feed of the journal TOC, look out for the RSS icon</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136im_/http://network.nature.com/images/feed-icon-14x14.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>at the table of contents page. Links to the RSS feeds of some popular scientific journals are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss">Nature</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Science</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.cell.com/rssFeed/Cell/rss.NewIssueAndArticles.xml">Cell</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.pnas.org/rss/current.xml">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></li></ul><p>Although most web browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 7, Firefox or Safari) will understand RSS feeds (so you can just click on the links provided above), you should use a dedicated RSS reader if you subscribe to more than a few RSS feeds. There are web-based RSS readers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> are popular choices) and dedicated programs for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/WWW/Feed_Readers/">every platform</a> (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/feeddemon/default.aspx">FeedDemon</a> for Windows or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> for Macintosh).</p><p>Dedicated RSS readers have two important features: they keep track of the journal articles you have already <em><em>read</em></em>, and they allow you to <em><em>mark</em></em> interesting articles for late use: reading the full-text article (online or after printing the PDF), and storing the article in your reference manager of choice.</p><p>RSS readers are also available for mobile devices such as the <em><em>iPhone</em></em> and are great for quickly going through a journal table of contents on the way to work.</p><h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3><p>Regular reading of journal table of contents in your field (browsing) is still an important way to keep up with the literature, even though the use of online databases to find specific articles (searching) has become more common in recent years.</p><p>Some people prefer to regularly flip through the printed journal when the latest issue arrives. But not only is there a delay between electronic publication and arrival of the printed journal, but most individuals can't afford to personally subscribe to more than a few journals at most. And looking at the printed copy subscribed to by the department or library is often no longer practical to do on a regular basis.</p><p>Receiving the journal TOC by <em><em>email</em></em> is a popular alternative, but has several disadvantages:</p><ul><li>Receiving the TOC by email requires a few extra steps, including providing your email address, and often signing up for a (free) account with the journal</li><li>Organizing the TOC emails with your email program (e.g. moving to appropriate subfolders) requires extra work</li><li>Marking an interesting article for later reading requires extra work, because the TOC is sent in one big email message</li><li>Sharing the TOC with coworkers is more difficult than with RSS feeds</li></ul><p>Because RSS is a universal computer-readable format, receiving the journal TOC can easily be extended. One example would be the integration of the journal RSS feeds into reference managers. <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> has this feature (e.g. the most recent issue of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.citeulike.org/journal/nature">Nature</a>), but I hope that more reference managers will do the same in the future.</p><p>Although almost all journals now provide RSS feeds to their TOC, how they do it might differ. Not every journal RSS feed uses the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> – now the preferred way to link to a journal article. There are also small differences in what information is provided in the RSS feed.</p><p><em><em>This blog post was inspired by a recent discussion about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/06/14/how-to-close-the-digital-divide-among-scientists">digital divide among scientists</a>.</em></em></p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Hammond, T., Hannay, T., &amp; Lund, B.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The term <em><em>digital divide</em></em> usually describes <em><em>the troubling gap between those who use computers and the Internet and those who do not</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">Wikipedia</a>). Many if not most scientists are experienced users of computers and the internet, and use email or public databases such as <em><em>PubMed</em></em> on a daily basis. But few scientists regularly use Web 2.0 tools, which would include both general tools such as <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> or <em><em>Facebook</em></em>, as well as tools specifically targeted at scientists (and this would of course include <em><em>Nature Network</em></em>).</p><p>Regular readers of this blog know that I am fascinated by technology, especially if this technology makes it easier to publish scientific papers. And like others I sometimes get carried away (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/05/28/google-wave-dont-forget-the-scientists">Google Wave</a> is a good recent example). Even among those scientists open to blogs, wikis, etc., not everybody wants to follow every technology trend. This could simply be because that would take too much time, but most people probably just don't care that much about technology.</p><p>So what can we do about this digital divide among scientists? Science is often very specialized, and sometimes only a few people participate in a discussion about a particular topic. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://radar.oreilly.com/">Tim O'Reilly</a> has coined the term <em><em>alpha geek</em></em> for people that are the first to use new technologies, and there certainly is a place for <em><em>science alpha geeks</em></em>. But Science Online is about science communication, and communication tools that are used by only a handful of people usually don't fulfill their purpose.</p><p>One easy solution would be to simply wait 10-20 years until most senior scientists are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">digital natives</a> (those that have grown up with digital technology such as computers, the Internet or mobile phones), but that seems to be an awfully long time for something this important.</p><p>We could build better tools. Good tools simply work and don't need a lot of explanations. For me <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> is such a tool, but strictly speaking not really Web 2.0, because it has no collaboration features. <em><em>Google Wave</em></em> could be another example, but only the next few months will tell. What makes a good Web 2.0 tool for scientists? Most importantly, that the tool solves an important everyday problem. Equally important, that there aren't high hurdles in using this tool in terms of cost and learning curve. Another hurdle: some Web 2.0 tools only start to become useful once they have signed up a large enough number of users.</p><p>But we also need to do more to communicate the usefulness of online tools for scientists. The original definition of the digital divide has a negative meaning and everybody probably agrees that we should at least try to overcome this divide. Although there certainly is also a digital divide among scientists, the general perception is probably not that those scientists that are not Web 2.0-savvy are at a disadvantage. We should have a much closer look at the tools that are currently available, define the scenarios where they can be useful, and focus on that. We talk too much about the details, technical or otherwise. One example: most scientists probably want to have an idea of when an online reference manager can be helpful rather than the tools they currently use, rather than discuss the subtle differences between the very similar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://www.2collab.com/">2collab</a>. Part of the problem is that people want to make money with their Web 2.0 tools for scientists, but forget that collaboration is more important than competition when the market still has to grow and is currently probably too small for viable business opportunities.</p><p>This makes closing the digital divide among scientists very much a science education exercise, and I think that science librarians should play a central role in this. Not surprisingly, a seminar last week by our local science librarian in our department and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/2009/06/cool_conferences_mental_overlo.php">a blog post</a> by science librarian John Dupuis (and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://friendfeed.com/johndupuis/8c6723b0/cool-conferences-mental-overload">FriendFeed</a> discussion around his blog post) were the inspiration for this post (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://friendfeed.com/coturnix/562bc610/wow-sunday-afternoon-and-i-don-t-even-know-on-what">another FriendFeed discussion</a> started by Bora Zivkovic made be write the post today instead of going to bed early).</p><p><em><em>Update 06/15/09:</em></em><br>One good strategy to overcome the digital divide among scientists would be a <em><em>Science 2.0 Cookbook</em></em>. Similar in format to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737/http://oreilly.com/store/series/cookbooks.csp">O'Reilly Cookbook series</a> for programming problems, the Science 2.0 cookbook would use the format problem/solution/discussion to provide a solution for problems like <em><em>How do I share references with my coworkers in the lab?</em></em> This could be started as a Wiki project.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001173737im_/http://www.linkwithin.com/pixel.png" class="kg-image" alt="Related Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger..." loading="lazy"></figure>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just returned from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://www.asco.org/ascov2/Meetings/ASCO+Annual+Meeting">American Society of Clinical Oncology</a> (ASCO) meeting in Orlando, with approximately 30.000 participants one of the largest oncology conferences. Like other conferences of this size, the experience can be overwhelming, but thankfully the organizers are getting better every year in using technology that helps in finding the most interesting sessions. Most sessions are made available as video podcasts or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/MultiMedia/Virtual+Meeting">online presentations</a>. There is currently still a delay of 24 hours, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the sessions streamed live as video over the internet in coming years. This year's ASCO also had the first official Twitter meet-up, although there still was relatively little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://twitter.com/asco">Twitter activity</a> compared to other conferences.</p><p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">we announced</a> <em><em>Science Online London</em></em>, the follow-up conference of last year's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://network.nature.com/groups/sciblog2008/forum/topics">Science Blogging 2008: London</a>, to take place August 22 at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://www.rigb.org/registrationControl?action=home">Royal Institution</a>. I am helping to organize the conference, and I'm finding myself in the middle of discussions about session topics, speakers and the right format to present and discuss science blogging, wikis, and other science-related activities happening online.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927im_/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/solologo.gif" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>These two events started me thinking about the reasons I go to conferences. After all, traveling to conferences is not only expensive, but can also be exhausting, and too much airline travel is certainly not good for the environment (places like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://www.dopplr.com/">Dopplr</a> can calculate your carbon profile). Here are a few points that I think make a conference a good conference worth attending in person:</p><h3 id="conferences-should-present-new-and-exciting-information-which-can-not-be-presented-differently">Conferences should present new and exciting information which can not be presented differently</h3><p>Oral presentations at conferences are usually the first public presentation of interesting research findings before they appear as published paper a little (or much) later. What we don't want to see is the presentation of the same old data that we have already seen the year before. Good educational sessions and keynote lectures find informative or entertaining ways to present their information, and again should not be simply a repeat performance (unless the audience is completely different).</p><p>Most conferences encourage the presentation of unpublished work, but speakers are often careful in doing so for a variety of reasons, e.g. fear of getting scooped, fear of problems with journal submissions or fear of problems with patentable work. This fear can make conference presentations rather boring, as presenters might hold back with the real exiting stuff until these results are at least accepted for publication.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://meetings.cshl.edu/">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a> try to solve this problem by policies that essentially make their meetings non-public. During the last week we have seen an intensive discussion (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/06/on_the_challenges_of_conferenc.php">On the challenges of conference blogging</a>) whether or not the sessions in a CSHL meeting can be communicated publicly by participating scientists via blogs or Twitter. I think that there is nothing wrong with small conferences being non-public, and that the same rules should apply to science bloggers as they do apply to journalists. But the conference organizers should clearly state their policies regarding blogging (including Twitter, FriendFeed and other microblogging tools).</p><h3 id="conferences-should-enable-as-much-active-participation-of-as-many-participants-as-possible">Conferences should enable as much active participation of as many participants as possible</h3><p>If we just want to listen to a presentation, we could do that without going to a conference, thanks to video streaming, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> and other ways of presenting online. Sometimes a paper is even published on the same the day as the plenary session, as happened recently with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/23/what-are-the-right-numbers-for-jupiter">JUPITER</a> trial.</p><p>Smaller sessions that leave enough room for discussions, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconferences</a> and poster sessions are all good formats to encourage active participation. It should be a goal at least for smaller conferences that every attendee has had a chance for active participation in one way or another. But active participation in a session is much more focussed than disussions in coffee breaks between sessions or afterwards in the bar.</p><h3 id="conferences-should-facilitate-personal-networking">Conferences should facilitate personal networking</h3><p>Meeting someone in person is very different from interacting online via email, Twitter or social network. For many people this is the real reason to go to a conference. Or as Henry Gee puts it (slightly out of context), “the most important part is to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://network.nature.com/people/U9556F6A5/blog/2007/08/06/someday-all-conferences-will-be-like-this">hang around in bars</a>.” Smaller conferences (e.g. 100-150 people), enough time for coffee and lunch breaks between sessions, and social activities around conferences (from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://network.nature.com/groups/sciblog2008/forum/topics/1959">science tours</a> to skiing) all facilitate networking.</p><p>I'm looking forward to go to a very special conference in five weeks: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://www.nature.com/nature/meetings/scifoo/index.html">Science Foo Camp</a>. And let's see whether we can put together an interesting <em><em>Science Online London</em></em> conference. Please suggest and discuss session topics and speakers in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://network.nature.com/groups/solondon/forum/topics">Nature Network Forum</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/http://friendfeed.com/solondon">FriendFeed group</a> or via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134927/mailto:topics%40scienceonlinelondon.org">email</a> until June 19. We are still looking for interesting session ideas, speaker suggestions and other suggestions to make this an exciting conference.</p>]]></content>

Google Wave is not only a product, but also an open protocol that anyone can use to build his own wave server.</p><p>Google Wave is already very interesting by itself, but can also be extended further:</p><ul><li>by <em><em>robots</em></em> that automate common tasks and run on the server, and</li><li>by <em><em>gadgets</em></em> that allow new ways of user interactions and run on the client.</li></ul><p>This sounds all rather geeky, but why should a scientist care about <em><em>Google Wave</em></em>? Part of the job of every scientist is to communicate and collaborate, and email is by far the most widely used tool to do that. Email has many shortcomings, some of which can be overcome by blogs, wikis, and a constantly growing number of other Web 2.0 tools from Twitter to FriendFeed. But Google Wave goes one step further. The basic idea of a wave is a document (and this can be everything from text to pictures) combined with the discussion about that document, and that is a very natural design for many scientific communications.</p><p>Google Wave will be publicly available later this year. I hope that by that time it will also have the first extensions designed specifically for scientists, e.g. for</p><ul><li><em><em>references</em></em> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053215/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/05/25/oai-pmh-interview-with-tony-hammond">embedded metadata</a> and discussions about these references</li><li><em><em><a href="http://ff.im/3lpdq">molecular structures</a></em></em> and other scientific data types</li><li><em><em>scientific manuscripts</em></em> in progress (Google Wave has nice tools for collaborative document editing)</li><li><em><em>lab notebooks</em></em> (again because of the wiki-like editing features)</li></ul><p>Google Wave could turn into serious competition for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053215/http://friendfeed.com/the-life-scientists">The Life Scientists Room</a> at FriendFeed. And it is a great topic to discuss further at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053215/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp">Science Foo Camp 2009</a>.</p><p><em><em>Update 5/29/09:</em></em> You can now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053215/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwave%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;feature=player_embedded">watch</a> the Google I/O presentation.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of us find, store and sometimes read scientific papers electronically. Although abstracts and full-text papers are usually available as web pages in HTML format, PDF is clearly the preferred format for storing and printing papers.</p><p>But publishing scientific papers in electronic form obviously requires more than providing the content in HTML or PDF format. We want to find the papers we are interested in on the journal homepage or in a digital library (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.pubmed.gov/">PubMed</a>), and for this we need metadata about the paper. The metadata could simply be an digital object identifier (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>), but the metadata could also contain important information required to find a paper in a search strategy (e.g. authors, title, publication date or keywords).</p><p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://network.nature.com/people/duncan/profile">Duncan Hull</a> <em><em>et al.</em></em> noted in a <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> paper last year (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000204">Defrosting the digital library: bibliographic tools for the next generation web</a>), metadata are often disconnected from the data, and there are no universally agreed standards to represent these metadata.</p><p>But why should we as scientists care about the technologies used to publish and distribute a paper? We shouldn't forget that these technologies could allow new and innovative ways to find and read scientific papers. One simple example: storing the metadata in the PDF file (using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP</a>) could make it much easier to import a large collection of PDF files into a reference manager.</p><p>One such initiative to provide the metadata of a scientific paper is OAI-PMH. I asked Tony Hammond from Nature.com a few questions about this newly supported protocol, as well as some more general questions about metadata provided by the Nature Publishing Group journals.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-oai-pmh-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what OAI-PMH is and does?</h3><p>Well, we'll first need to unpack that double acronym. OAI-PMH is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a> which comes from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives Initiative</a>. It's traditionally been known simply as OAI, although these days it's more properly referred to in full as OAI-PMH in view of the arrival of a new sibling protocol: OAI-ORE, which stands for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">Object Reuse and Exchange</a>. The two protocols are complementary: OAI-PMH deals with metadata harvesting, while OAI-ORE is concerned with content aggregation and compound digital objects.</p><p>In brief, OAI-PMH provides an interoperability framework for networked repositories to exchange metadata records on their holdings. Such metadata typically includes bibliographic-type descriptions of repository items, such as title, authors and other identifying information. At a technical level OAI-PMH provides a very simple Web-based API for querying a repository by item, by set of items or by date range with data records being returned in an XML format which can be validated by a W3C XML Schema. A basic metadata format using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> is available from all OAI-PMH implementations, while other richer community-specific metadata formats are encouraged for a fuller semantic exchange.</p><h3 id="2-what-is-prism-aggregator-message-pam-">2. What is PRISM Aggregator Message (PAM)?</h3><p>I posted an entry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2009/05/post_2.html">PRISM Aggregator Message</a> on CrossTech recently which delved into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.idealliance.org/industry_resources/intelligent_content_informed_workflow/about_the_prism_aggregator_message">PRISM Aggregator Message</a> (PAM) format and provided some specific details and also reasons why we chose to use it. Basically our choice of PAM stems from our earlier work with RSS and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://prismstandard.org/">PRISM</a>.</p><p>Our first foray into semantic descriptions was with RSS feeds. While still at Elsevier I had collaborated with Timo Hannay and Ben Lund at Nature Publishing Group and wrote up a piece for <em><em>XML.com</em></em> entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/1252">Why Choose RSS 1.0?</a> which described how journal RSS feeds could be enhanced with PRISM metadata. Specifically that piece reviewed the different RSS strains and came out strongly in favour of RSS 1.0 which being an RDF application was truly extensible and could accommodate new vocabularies. The identification of PRISM as a useful vocabulary was largely based on noting the adjacency of two RDF use cases in an early edition of the W3C RDF Primer: RSS and PRISM. I had been reading up on RSS and RDF and I suddenly thought “Bingo!”, we can add in PRISM terms to the RSS feeds since PRISM is a very handy supplement to Dublin Core and provides support for enumerated fields such as volume, issue, and page number. Another advantage for publishers was that PRISM is a simple term set and did not require any specialist library knowledge. A later paper by the same authors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december04/hammond/12hammond.html">The Role of RSS in Science Publishing</a> published with <em><em>D-Lib Magazine</em></em> made a more in-depth review of RSS in scholarly publishing and concluded again that RSS 1.0 with its transparent support for new vocabularies such as PRISM was the right way to go.</p><p>We wanted to provide this standard article description that we were shipping with RSS also with OAI-PMH records. Unfortunately we could not simply move over the RDF properties into an OAI-PMH delivered RDF/XML payload. The problem with OAI-PMH is that it requires a record to be constrained by a W3C XML Schema. This is where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.idealliance.org/industry_resources/intelligent_content_informed_workflow/about_the_prism_aggregator_message">PRISM Aggregator Message</a> (PAM) comes in.</p><p>PAM is an application of PRISM and defines a W3C XML Schema for XML content aggregators to use. The message is simply structured as a sequence of one or more articles each with a body section for XHTML content and a head section with PRISM metadata. The body sections are optional so PAM can be used exclusively as a simple metadata packaging format as we have chosen to implement for OAI-PMH.</p><h3 id="3-how-does-pam-relate-to-the-nlm-dtd">3. How does PAM relate to the NLM DTD?</h3><p>Well, both are schemas for content. This was my blind spot with regard to PAM for many years. Our focus was on metadata exchange. PRISM was a vocabulary for metadata, or rather a set of closely related vocabularies. No problem. And yet there was this thing called PAM which was busying itself with content. And we had no interest in that as we had our own Nature-specific DTD. But the PRISM folks were very enthusiastic – so clearly there was a need.</p><p>It only dawned on me relatively slowly that the PAM DTD (also available in W3C XML Schema form since PRISM 2.0) was the correspondent of the NLM DTD in the scholarly world. It provides an interchange format for content elements. So the real impetus behind the development of the PRISM metadata vocabularies was as a direct support to XML content exchange although content is not actually required to be present and the metadata alone can be used in different applications.</p><h3 id="4-what-are-typical-use-cases-for-oai-pmh">4. What are typical use cases for OAI-PMH?</h3><p>The main use of OAI-PMH is to sync, or perhaps a better term would be align, the holdings descriptions of digital repository collections, where the word “repository” should be understood in its broadest context. The protocol exposes a machine interface for the robot harvesting of records from a data provider which a service provider will build upon to provide value add services. But this machine interface can sometimes also be accessed through a user interface (such as that provided by the Nature OAI-PMH service) which adds a browser onto the repository records.</p><p>For additional uses of OAI-PMH a good start point is the paper by Herbert Van de Sompel, Jeff Young and Thom Hickey in <em><em>D-Lib Magazine</em></em> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july03/young/07young.html">Using the OAI-PMH … Differently</a>. This paper notes that the metadata formats used by OAI-PMH are any that can validated by a W3C XML Schema and that therefore OAI-PMH is nothing less than “a medium for incremental, date-sensitive exchange of any form of semi-structured data”. OAI-PMH clearly has legs.</p><h3 id="5-why-should-researchers-care-about-oai-pmh">5. Why should researchers care about OAI-PMH?</h3><p>I'm not sure that researchers should want to have any specific knowledge of OAI-PMH. Bear in mind that at heart this is an infrastructural technology which exists down in the data pipes and service conduits and is analogous to the fibre or radio channels that deliver broadband services to users.</p><p>Applications that make use of the syndicated metadata records that OAI-PMH provides for, however, are another matter. Those are very definitely things that researchers will care much about. It is difficult to distil those consumer applications into any specific categories as the services platform that OAI-PMH supports is very broad, ranging from general to domain-specific descriptions to full text records, and beyond.</p><h3 id="6-what-are-the-different-data-formats-that-descriptions-of-nature-com-articles-are-provided-how-do-they-differ">6. What are the different data formats that descriptions of Nature.com articles are provided? How do they differ?</h3><p>At Nature Publishing Group we are working towards a common delivery architecture for our metadata. We are defining a core set of properties and making descriptions built from that property set available across multiple channels. Currently we are focussing on the basic bibliographic record which supports reference linking so that links can be made back to the platform. But once the channels are established they can be readily amplified to carry additional properties using the various channels' native packaging mechanisms. Metadata channels include both standalone services (e.g. RSS, OAI-PMH, etc.) as well as content objects themselves (HTML, PDF, etc.).</p><p>On the services side we began almost six years ago with RSS feeds, which being RSS 1.0 are full RDF/XML documents. The open data model implicit in RDF means that we can readily add new properties into our feeds. A case in point is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.iupac.org/inchi/">InChI</a> identifier for chemical substances which we are currently working towards adding into our RSS feeds for <em><em>Nature Chemistry</em></em>, similarly to what the Royal Society of Chemistry has done earlier with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/ProjectProspect/index.asp">Project Prospect</a>.</p><p>We have just released our OAI-PMH service which provides the same basic property set as RSS but in PAM format – see the post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2009/05/a_catalog_for_naturecom.html">A Catalog for Nature.com</a>. As alluded to above OAI-PMH comes from an earlier generation of protocols that put more rather emphasis on validation (or packaging the elements) than on data modelling (or relating the elements). That is, while the records served by the OAI-PMH server are validatable using W3C XML Schema the properties they contain are not directly reusable within an open, cross-application context such as is provided for by RDF. We do though have a simple stylesheet that can generate RDF/XML from these OAI-PMH records.</p><p>On the content side we added in the same properties to our HTML using META tags a year ago now – see the post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/05/naturecom_adds_metadata.html">Nature.com adds metadata</a>. These properties are easily extractable by tools as simple key/value pairs. While this metadata is not directly representable as RDF it can be readily generated. We are anyway moving to make this property set more accessible by adding in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html">RDFa</a> which has now gone mainstream following Google's recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html">announcement of rich snippets</a> and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=146898">support for RDFa</a>.</p><p>We also began at the end of that year a programme to embed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/">XMP</a> packets into all of our newly published PDF files, again using the same basic property set – see the post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP Labelling for Nature</a>. The XMP packets are essentially simple RDF/XML documents.</p><p>You can begin to see where all this is going. We are aiming to make all our descriptions conformant to a common data model, i.e. to RDF. That way, regardless of the distribution channel used the data delivered down that pipe can be merged into the common semantic graph.</p><h3 id="7-what-tools-can-researchers-use-to-retrieve-these-descriptions">7. What tools can researchers use to retrieve these descriptions?</h3><p>Many of these channels are amenable to repurposing. The metadata they carry can be consumed within application-specific contexts, or it can be extracted from the channel medium for use in a wider generic context. Consider, for example, an RSS feed which can be used directly by a desktop or Web-based RSS reader. But it can also be mined for its metadata content, trivially in this case since the medium is already RDF/XML. Or consider again the metadata within an XMP packet in a PDF document which can be read by a viewer application (e.g. Adobe Acrobat) and presented to the user in a “Document Properties” display. But it can also be extracted simply by locating the XMP packet and reading the single XML child element which is itself a full RDF/XML document.</p><p>So one could say there are two classes of tools, those that operate at an application or specific layer and those that operate at a more generic layer, albeit with some preprocessing steps to unpack the metadata.</p><p>I should really expand here on OAI-PMH specifically since this is new for us. The primary means of interacting with an OAI-PMH server is via its service endpoint. Obviously to manage pagination seamlessly (the resumption token provides a cursor into the result record set) a library or tool is of enormous assistance. The OAI website provides a reasonably full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/tools/tools.php">listing of PMH tools</a> available.</p><p>Our OAI-PMH server implements Jeff Young's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/cat.htm">OAICat</a> which is a Java servlet webapp providing a repository framework which also comes with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.nature.com/oai/">forms interface</a> for testing. This interface is especially useful for occasional use, e.g. a single “<em><em>GetRecord</em></em>“:http://www.nature.com/oai/html/getRecord.html or call to “<em><em>ListRecords</em></em>“:http://www.nature.com/oai/html/listRecords.html (or “<em><em>ListIdentifiers</em></em>“:http://www.nature.com/oai/html/listIdentifiers.html), although repetitive calls to <em><em>ListRecords</em></em> (or <em><em>ListIdentifiers</em></em>) would quickly become tedious.</p><p>For harvesting we have used for testing purposes the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://oai.rubyforge.org/">ruby-oai</a> gem for Ruby by Ed Summers and Will Groppe which includes a library and simple client which can also be run interactively as a shell. Note that this gem is not listed on the OAI-PMH tools page.</p><p>We have also made use of the open-source Java client <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.oclc.org/research/software/oai/harvester2.htm">OAIHarvester2</a>, again by Jeff Young of OCLC. We used this for test harvesting of our full record collection as it was a robust implementation and we had earlier run into some problems with the Ruby app as it is not as finished as it might be, although it remains very configurable and easy to use. Our intention is to proceed with the Ruby app for incremental harvesting. We're aiming to become consumers of our own services for quality control purposes.</p><h3 id="8-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-nature-com">8. What are your responsibilities at Nature.com?</h3><p>I work within the Platform Technologies group on infrastructural projects supporting discovery and access across the nature.com platform, especially those that are built upon open technologies. My job handle is <em><em>Application Architect</em></em> although we're working on deconstructing that. I don't have line responsibilities but do supervise the development of our new interfaces.</p><p>We are corralling these various standards – some come from the wider Web world, some from the digital library community, some come from industry, and some are closer to home – under the general moniker of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.nature.com/libraries/public_interfaces/index.html">Public Interfaces</a>. We also have a new documentation centre for this which is located on our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.nature.com/libraries/index.html">Librarian Gateway</a>.</p><p>I do maintain an active presence with various external bodies, not unsurprisingly given that the focus of my work is on defining and building interfaces. I have been from the beginning very involved in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> and the development of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> and related technologies. Most recently I have worked with a CrossRef WG to draw up a best practices document for scholarly publishers and RSS, and we are now starting work on a companion document for embedding metadata. I am also on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.idealliance.org/industry_resources/intelligent_content_informed_workflow/prism/membership">PRISM WG</a> and a regular contributor.</p><p>Other activities I'm involved with include being a member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/">SRU</a> Editorial Board and of the eJournal Joint Technical Panel on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/legaldep/">Legal Deposit</a> here in the UK. I have previously been a member of the OpenURL Standard Committe that developed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.niso.org/standards/z39-88-2004/">ANSI/NISO Z39.88</a>, and worked as a member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">OAI-ORE</a> TC and the JISC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/aboutus/committees/workinggroups/palsmetadatagroup.aspx">PALS Metadata and Interoperability WG</a>.</p><h3 id="9-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-for-nature-com">9. What did you do before starting to work for Nature.com?</h3><p>Before working with Nature I was with Elsevier (2001-2004) as part of their Advanced Technology Group, and prior to that I worked with Academic Press (1997-2001) as Head of the Online Resource Activity. With Academic Press I was part of Electronic Publishing team that managed IDEAL – one of the first successful large journals platforms that applied consortial site licenses.</p><p>My previous experiences included a long-ish stint (1986-1995) with NATO SACLANTCEN in La Spezia, Italy, as Scientific Editor and subsequently as Head of the Information Branch. The facility was named SACLANT ASW Research Centre when I joined and had been transmuted into NATO Undersea Research Centre by the time I left (the anti-submarine warfare aspect deftly tidied away). Same mission though, to work on basic research (from oceanography to operational research) that would aid the NATO nations in their submarine detection programmes. (It now seems to be commuted to NURC alone.)</p><p>Prior to that I worked (1982-1985) as Assistant to the Editors for the North-Holland Publishing Company journal <em><em>Nuclear Physics A</em></em> based in Copenhagen, Denmark, and previous to that as a Research Associate in the Space Physics Laboratory at the University of Kent at Canterbury, UK where I collaborated in building a micrometeoroid sensor experiment which was deployed by the Space Shuttle.</p><h3 id="10-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-metadata-at-nature-com">10. Do you want to talk about future plans for metadata at Nature.com?</h3><p>Sure. I guess I should separate out metadata management per se from metadata delivery and discovery. As a company we have an active programme underway to review wholesale our various ontologies and vocabularies in order to coordinate and streamline them. We also have ongoing initiatives to add in text mining to our production workflow and to address the entity extraction problem. Having better and richer vocabularies and new terms is one step. The next step is how to communicate that value in an open and structured manner to consumer applications.</p><p>My particular focus is on delivery channels. As I mentioned earlier we are working towards providing a notion of public interfaces: a set of open interfaces for delivering standard object descriptions. Complementing the OAI-PMH service which provides a catalog for nature.com we are also currently working on an SRU (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/">Search and Retrieve by URL</a>) service to support structured searching. And that would also be accessible through simple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a> conventions.</p><p>We will be extending our page markup to include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa</a> which will not only provide metadata in RDF format but will also localize those descriptions to the content fragment so that cut-and-paste operations will scoop up any descriptive markup along with the actual content.</p><p>We are now close to completing our support across our full title range for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404/http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/">XMP</a> in PDFs. A related development will be to embed XMP into our images (JPEGs and GIFs) so that all of our main resources then become self-describing. It is a wonder that we have gotten thus far in online publishing sending out content entities which are not unambiguously labelled.</p><p>And beyond this all lie the promises and challenges of the Semantic Web.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101404im_/http://www.linkwithin.com/pixel.png" class="kg-image" alt="Related Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger..." loading="lazy"></figure>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reference managers are essential tools to read and write scholarly papers. In the last few years we have seen both a number of new reference managers (most of them web-based), but also a trend for the established reference managers to gain social networking features. More choice is great, but it also creates confusion about the right tool to use. I have talked about reference managers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030110/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/15/reference-manager-overview">before</a>, but in this slideshow I look at the features that I find important.</p><p>And there are at least two features that I like, but haven't really seen implemented in a reference manager:</p><ul><li><em><em>Integration of an RSS reader for journal table of contents (TOC)</em></em>. Currently I use a standard RSS reader, and it requires too many steps to get interesting references from a TOC into my reference manager.</li><li><em><em>Tracking the post-publication discussion</em></em>. I want my reference manager to link to the papers that cite a particular reference (I currently use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030110/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a> for that) and link to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030110/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/04/28/faculty-of-1000-interview-with-richard-grant">Faculty of 1000</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030110/http://researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging.org</a> comments on that paper.</li></ul><p>In the last slide I wonder whether there is a) one perfect reference manager, b) one perfect reference manager for my particular needs, or c) I will always need more than one reference manager and have to move references back and forth between them. Currently I'm at c), using mostly Papers, Endnote and Connotea. But Mendeley, Zotero, Refworks and Endnote are moving in a direction where they try to cover all requirements.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientific papers are submitted to a journal as word processor files, usually in Microsoft Word format. After the paper is accepted for publication, the journal takes the manuscript and translates the text into a format that is better suited for publication online and/or in print. XML and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM DTD</a> – a set of XML schema modules – have evolved as the standard data format for this purpose. Files in the NLM DTD format can in turn be translated into HTML and/or PDF for publication. The NLM DTD format is also used to transfer journal articles from publishers to archives (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a>) and for long-term archiving.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.inera.com/extylesinfo.shtml">eXtyles</a> is a tool that facilitate the translation between these different document formats, and in the process also help to clean up broken references and other errors in the manscript. As paper authors usually don’t see much of what happens to their manuscript after submission, I thought I’d ask Elizabeth Blake and Bruce Rosenblum from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.inera.com/">Inera</a> (the company behind eXtyles) a few questions.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-extyles-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what eXtyles is and does?</h3><p>Elizabeth Blake: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.inera.com/">Inera</a> offers several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.inera.com/extylesinfo.shtml">eXtyles products</a>, all of which are designed to clean up, structure, validate, and export scholarly content. The desktop version of eXtyles is the most widely used product; it’s a plug-in to Microsoft Word that is customized according to the editorial style and production requirements of each publisher that uses it. eXtyles:</p><ul><li>collects and exports manuscript metadata</li><li>cleans up extraneous or incorrect document formatting</li><li>applies structure to the document on the paragraph and character level (using author- and editor-friendly Word styles rather than visually intrusive tags)</li><li>automatically enforces certain editorial style requirements through large-scale, context-sensitive find and replace</li><li>parses, restructures, links, and corrects bibliographic references using internal templates and databases as well as external sources such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez">PubMed</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a></li><li>links citations and callouts to their respective references and objects</li><li>exports high-quality XML from Word according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM DTD</a> or any other DTD required by the publisher</li></ul><p>eXtyles is a uniquely flexible tool in that it can accommodate any editorial style and the wide variety of workflows used by different publishers, and it can also process any Word-readable, author-submitted manuscript.</p><h3 id="2-what-is-the-difference-between-extyles-and-the-microsoft-word-article-authoring-add-in">2. What is the difference between eXtyles and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx#Tools">Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-in</a> ?</h3><p><em><em>Bruce Rosenblum:</em></em> eXtyles makes two assumptions. First, eXtyles does not rely on the author to complete document structuring tasks – in our experience, journals have not succeeded in having authors provide sufficiently accurate styling or markup in Word files (the application used by most scholarly authors) to allow for automatic creation of high-quality XML. Second, eXtyles assumes that authors make other kinds of mistakes, whether adding inappropriate formatting, using unsupported fonts for special characters, or making informational errors in reference lists, and all of these problems must be corrected as part of the publishing process.</p><p>eXtyles is designed to overcome the limitations of how authors commonly prepare manuscripts by providing the tools that publishers need to clean up, rapidly edit, and then convert manuscripts to XML. eXtyles has been carefully developed over ten years to accurately address the reality of what publishers see in author submissions.</p><p>By contrast, the Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-in has been developed as a content creation tool. It is designed for authors to structure articles in Word 2007 as they write. In this model, authors must add structural information rather than just submit the text of their article. The Add-in assumes authors will create reference lists with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA100674921033.aspx">Word 2007 citation manager</a> and will adhere to all requirements necessary to successfully save the manuscript to NLM DTD XML when they have completed writing their article. Also, the Microsoft Add-in does not provide tools to prepare an article for XML conversion if the Add-in was not used during creation of the article, which is a key feature of eXtyles.</p><p>Fundamentally the target audience differs: the Microsoft Add-in assumes use by authors, whereas eXtyles provides tools to publishing personnel that allow authors to concentrate on great scientific research rather than the technical aspects of article publication.</p><h3 id="3-what-are-the-most-common-problems-in-submitted-manuscripts-that-can-be-fixed-by-extyles-are-there-problems-that-have-to-be-fixed-manually">3. What are the most common problems in submitted manuscripts that can be fixed by eXtyles? Are there problems that have to be fixed manually?</h3><p><em><em>Elizabeth Blake:</em></em> The most common problems range from relatively simple issues such as extraneous formatting or misapplied styles to more complex issues such as missing data or incorrect or uncited references. Hovering in between these are violations of editorial style – for example, British versus American spelling or non-standard abbreviations for units of measure – which eXtyles can also correct.</p><p>Some problems do have to be fixed manually. eXtyles does not take the place of an editor; rather, it automates as much of the low-level copy editing as can be reliably automated while drawing the editor’s attention to issues that require follow up. An example would be eXtyles flagging a callout to a table that is missing from the manuscript; this obviously requires human intervention, but the warning saves time and flags problems early in the workflow when they are easier to resolve.</p><p>On a larger scale, the problem eXtyles is designed to solve is getting the accepted author manuscript published as quickly and accurately as possible. The fully eXtyled file can be flowed into a typesetting system such as InDesign with the paragraph styles aligned to the composition template, saving a lot of labor during the typesetting stage, or the Word file can be converted directly to NLM XML with the push of a button, allowing users to create rich, valid XML without any XML knowledge or expertise.</p><h3 id="4-extyles-helps-with-editorial-tasks-such-as-document-cleanup-and-citation-checking-why-shouldn-t-these-tasks-be-left-to-the-authors-and-checked-when-a-manuscript-is-submitted">4. eXtyles helps with editorial tasks such as document cleanup and citation checking. Why shouldn’t these tasks be left to the authors and checked when a manuscript is submitted?</h3><p><em><em>Elizabeth Blake:</em></em> Theoretically these tasks are the authors’ responsibility! In practice it is an extremely rare manuscript that doesn’t have errors, particularly reference errors. Our goal is not to discourage authors from submitting clean and accurate manuscripts; our goal is to facilitate the process when that doesn’t happen, which is most of the time. The eXtyles reference-processing tools, in particular the tools that link and correct references with data retrieved from PubMed and CrossRef, go a step beyond what even a very thorough copy editor is typically able to flush out given the time constraints of a deadline-driven workflow.</p><p>As for performing these tasks at submission, the eXtyles integration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/home.htm">Editorial Manager</a> does just that, providing an informative reference quality check early in the workflow so that responsibility for fixing the references can, if the publisher prefers, be pushed back on the authors.</p><h3 id="5-if-extyles-validates-and-corrects-references-why-do-most-journals-insist-on-bibliographies-formatted-in-a-specific-house-style">5. If eXtyles validates and corrects references, why do most journals insist on bibliographies formatted in a specific house style?</h3><p><em><em>Elizabeth Blake:</em></em> There are two ways in which eXtyles corrects references: one is by correcting the data (e.g., PubMed reports that the first author in reference 2 is incorrect) and the other is by correcting the format according to the publisher’s house style. Ensuring correct data in a reference, which eXtyles does with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.inera.com/refcorrection.shtml">Automatic Reference Correction</a>, is part of ensuring accuracy in the scientific record. As for the varieties of reference styles, many developed as necessary elements of print publication – for instance, some abbreviated house styles were devised as paper-saving measures. So long as print is not dead, these concerns are still relevant. However, in an electronic world, formatting of references may be less important, though a good editor will always have an argument for why their style is preferable (I say that as a former editor). We at Inera remain neutral on the topic since eXtyles can reformat references according to any preferred editorial style if a publisher requires it.</p><h3 id="6-what-is-the-nlm-dtd-what-was-your-part-in-developing-it">6. What is the NLM DTD? What was your part in developing it?</h3><p>Bruce Rosenblum: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM DTD</a> is a family of tag sets designed for full-text XML markup of scholarly articles. The intent of the NLM DTD Suite is to mark up and preserve the intellectual content of journals independent of the form in which the content is delivered. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/faq.html">The suite can be used to publish and archive journal content, and to facilitate content interchange between organizations</a>. And despite the NLM moniker, the suite was designed from day-one for full-text markup of journal content in any discipline.</p><p>Our work on the NLM DTD started in 2001 when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://lib.harvard.edu/">Harvard University Library</a>, under a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.mellon.org/">Mellon Foundation</a> grant, was asked to study formats for long-term archiving of eJournal content. Harvard decided that PDF was not a viable archive format, and discovered that every publisher had a proprietary DTD. Harvard then approached Inera, because of our experience working with many DTDs including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://download.www.techstreet.com/cgi-bin/pdf/free/228869/12083-a.pdf">ISO 12083</a>, to study the feasibility of developing a single DTD into which the content from all publishers could be converted for the purposes of long-term archiving. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.diglib.org/preserve/hadtdfs.pdf">e-Journal Archjive DTD Feasibility Study</a> we wrote describes the requirements for such a DTD.</p><p>At the same time, NLM was making major revisions to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a> 1.0 DTD. NLM, Harvard, and Mellon decided to combine resources on a single project co-developed by NLM, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.mulberrytech.com/">Mulberry Technologies</a>, and Inera. Version 1.0 of the NLM DTD was released in April 2003. The scope of use was originally focused on the needs of PubMed Central, and a long-term archive (now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.portico.org/">Portico</a>) seed-funded by the Mellon Foundation.</p><p>The NLM DTD was quickly adopted by others when they discovered the coverage and flexibility. And as publishers switched from SGML to XML, they found that adopting an off-the-shelf public DTD was far less expensive than converting their existing SGML DTDs to XML. As use has expanded, support has grown so that many off-the-shelf solutions are now available for working with the DTD. Inera continues to serve on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/working-group.html">NLM DTD Advisory Board</a>.</p><h3 id="7-how-does-extyles-use-the-nlm-dtd">7. How does eXtyles use the NLM DTD?</h3><p><em><em>Bruce Rosenblum:</em></em> eXtyles users, with no knowledge of XML, can create high-quality XML according to the NLM DTD as a simple one-button action after using eXtyles to easily complete editorial preparation of a manuscript. In other words, eXtyles XML creation is a natural by-product of normal manuscript preparation for publication, and it requires no specialized user knowledge.</p><p>Because eXtyles was developed as an open platform that can be customized to the editorial and production needs of any publisher, it is internally DTD agnostic. In this regard, eXtyles can be used to convert content to any of the DTDs in the NLM DTD Suite (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">Journal Publishing</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/">Archive and Interchange</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/book/">Book</a>).</p><p>Furthermore, the NLM DTD suite actually allows for a wide range of interpretation, and eXtyles can easily meet any of those interpretations. For example, the NLM DTD supports two table models, XHTML and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/options/OASIS/tag-library/19990315/n-xe20.html">CALS</a>. eXtyles can produce content in either table model, depending on the workflow requirements of the publisher. A wide range of other configuration options are available to meet the needs of specific publisher requirements.</p><h3 id="8-can-the-nlm-dtd-also-used-by-authors-to-submit-their-papers-to-journals-or-repositories-if-not-what-are-the-limitations">8. Can the NLM DTD also used by authors to submit their papers to journals or repositories? If not, what are the limitations?</h3><p><em><em>Bruce Rosenblum:</em></em> In theory authors could submit their papers to journals or repositories in XML. However, in practice this has not occurred and we do not consider it likely to occur in the near future. There are a few key obstacles.</p><p>First, the primary job of researchers is to conduct research and report the results. Because technical knowledge of publishing formats is not a required part of the typical researcher’s job, the majority of researchers do not submit papers to journals or repositories in XML when they can much more easily do so in PDF or Word.</p><p>By extension of this point, most publishers are interested in high-quality research. One publisher told us, “If a manuscript with great science is submitted on birch bark, we’ll find a way to publish it.” We believe that in a world where journals compete for the best papers, publishers will continue to put research quality ahead of submission formats.</p><p>Second, creation of high-quality XML is just not that simple. Even with the tools that have been developed in the past ten years, publishers with experienced editorial and production teams still have problems producing consistently high-quality XML; if you doubt this point, please look at a typical first round PubMed Central publisher validation report. If publishers with experienced production teams do not find this easy, then we believe that production of consistently high-quality XML by authors is not likely to occur in the next few years.</p><h3 id="10-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-inera">10. What are your responsibilities at Inera?</h3><p><em><em>Bruce Rosenblum:</em></em> As CEO, I am involved in all aspects of Inera. My background is originally in software development, and I use this expertise to guide the development and quality assurance of eXtyles. I am also responsible for managing the business side of Inera. But probably my most important role is coordinating the incredibly creative team of people who work on eXtyles.</p><p><em><em>Elizabeth Blake:</em></em> My role is primarily customer facing, from marketing to configuration and training up through support. My goal is to ensure that potential customers get all the information they need about eXtyles to make the right decision and to ensure that, once they become customers, they continue to be happy with that decision. We rely heavily on customer feedback when planning enhancements to eXtyles, and I tend to focus on the user experience when we work through the details of any new project.</p><h3 id="11-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-on-extyles">11. What did you do before starting to work on eXtyles?</h3><p><em><em>Bruce Rosenblum:</em></em> Before eXtyles, Inera spent years providing SGML and XML consulting and software development services to publishers. Prior to that, I spent 15 years developing commercial software products for companies like Microsoft, Word Perfect, Houghton Mifflin, and Broderbund. Going way back, I’ve always had an interest in problems of working with text – my first professional software project was building a word processor for Chinese on an Apple II in 1980.</p><p><em><em>Elizabeth Blake:</em></em> I started in scholarly publishing as a copy editor for the Cell Press journal <em><em>Neuron</em></em> and then worked as the managing editor of <em><em>Neuron</em></em> for several years before moving to <em><em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em></em>. At Inera, my years of real-world editorial and production experience have been very valuable and help to ensure that eXtyles development is centered on solving the problems that publishers face every day.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog">Richard Grant</a>, who needs no introduction here on Nature Network, has just moved to London <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/04/09/on-the-payroll">to start a new job</a> as <em><em>information architect</em></em> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://www.f1000biology.com/">Faculty of 1000</a>. I took this opportunity to ask Richard a few questions not only about Faculty of 1000, but also about his role in the company and future plans for the service that they have in mind.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116im_/http://friendfeed.s3.amazonaws.com/f353fdfe5c24bfb525680563a4a5c04b3760fafd" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-faculty-of-1000-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what Faculty of 1000 is and does?</h3><p>The scientific literature is immense, and growing. It has become very difficult to keep up, especially if you’re going to keep an eye on developments not immediately in your own area. For someone new to a field it’s almost impossible to know — without insider knowledge — what papers are important, which are the key publications; where a field is going and what are the key developments.</p><p>So what we do is provide a kind of ‘filter’ on top of the literature: we have about five thousand principle investigators, who we call ‘Faculty’, across biology and medicine, who in the course of their own reading will write short evaluations on the important and influential papers in their field. We’re also recruiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://www.f1000biology.com/about/associateFMs">Associate Faculty members</a>: trusted junior members of a Faculty member’s lab or practice who will write their own evaluations and increase our coverage. And we’re not just talking about stuff that’s published in <em><em>Nature</em></em> or <em><em>Cell</em></em> — or <em><em>NEJM</em></em> or <em><em>The Lancet</em></em> — but in the specialized, work-a-day journals. What’s more, this expert opinion, or what we’re calling ‘post-publication peer review’, gives our users a measure of the ‘quality’ of individual papers that is independent of, and much quicker than, the impact factor of the journal.</p><h3 id="2-what-part-of-faculty-of-1000-is-free-and-what-part-needs-a-paid-subscription">2. What part of Faculty of 1000 is free and what part needs a paid subscription</h3><p>You can search or browse the entire database, and sign up for email alerts, so you can see which papers have been evaluated. You can’t actually read the evaluations themselves unless you have an institutional or personal subscription.</p><h3 id="3-how-does-faculty-of-1000-integrate-with-reference-managers-such-as-endnote-refworks-zotero-or-connotea">3. How does Faculty of 1000 integrate with reference managers such as Endnote, Refworks, Zotero or Connotea?</h3><p>You can download evaluations into a reference manager just like you can papers from PubMed. We’re working on proper integration with online tools (such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>) and other ‘social media’ tools. I’m also keen to work with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> to improve the user experience.</p><h3 id="4-what-are-the-incentives-for-faculty-members-to-evaluate-papers">4. What are the incentives for faculty members to evaluate papers?</h3><p>Exposure and kudos, mainly! The Faculty member’s name is displayed prominently on the evaluations (you can see who’s written an evaluation even without a subscription). Reputation is important to scientists and being invited to become a Faculty member says to the rest of the community that your opinion is respected and your peers think highly of you. We also profile Faculty members who write timely or important evaluations, or who have news of their own (grants, papers, awards) and give them publicity through press releases, etc.</p><p>What’s more, our Faculty members <em><em>like</em></em> the combination of expert opinion and original articles. They see a value in it, and realize that there’s a kind of synergy going on here; if they contribute then others will be encouraged to too, and everybody wins.</p><p>I’d like to explore how evaluations might become citable — so that Faculty can put their work for us on their CV, how it might benefit their career, grant applications etc. We’re also considering more tangible benefits.</p><h3 id="5-how-are-faculty-members-selected">5. How are faculty members selected?</h3><p>The Heads of Faculty, for each subject or speciality, are elected or selected on the recommendation of large numbers of medics and scientists we talk to. They divide their Faculty into Sections and then select two or three Section Heads. These scientists in turn identify the sub-fields within their Section and select Faculty Members, checking with Heads of Faculty. The Section Heads select Faculty Members on the basis of various criteria:</p><ul><li>the number of Faculty Members should be proportionally representative of the number of papers published within that field;</li><li>the selected Faculty Members should be well respected by their peers and perceived as being fair-minded;</li><li>there must be a good representation of genders, nationalities and age/seniority.</li></ul><p>Faculty Members themselves are being asked to co-opt younger workers within their groups — post-docs, say — to help increase coverage and to write their own evaluations. We call these ‘Associate Faculty’.</p><h3 id="6-can-faculty-of-1000-users-comment-on-papers-or-paper-evaluations">6. Can Faculty of 1000 users comment on papers or paper evaluations?</h3><p>Not at the moment, no. Faculty members can comment, or contribute a ‘dissent’ if they disagree with an evaluation, and authors of the evaluated papers are encouraged to respond, but we feel it’s important for users to know that they can trust what we publish. However, we’re currently planning to launch a forum whereby users <em><em>can</em></em> comment freely on evaluated papers. This would be open to anyone who registers, without a subscription, but kept distinct from the main evaluation.</p><h3 id="7-can-paper-authors-comment-on-evaluations-of-their-papers">7. Can paper authors comment on evaluations of their papers?</h3><p>Yes! At the moment we get emails from authors saying that they’re pleased to have their papers selected, but we’re going to make it possible for them to comment on the evaluations directly so that a conversation with the Faculty can be initiated.</p><h3 id="8-what-is-faculty-of-1000-reports">8. What is Faculty of 1000 Reports?</h3><p>F1000 Reports carries short reviews, or commentaries, on emerging trends identified from within the F1000 database. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://f1000medicine.com/reports/">F1000 Medicine Reports</a> features studies that are likely to change clinical practice and summarizes implications for clinicians. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://www.f1000biology.com/reports/">F1000 Biology Reports</a> contextualizes important and exciting papers or clusters of publications. The Advisory Board (for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://f1000biology.com/reports/advisoryboard">F1000 Biology Reports</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075116/http://f1000medicine.com/reports/advisoryboard">F1000 Medicine Reports</a>) identifies potential topics and invites appropriate Faculty members to write about them.</p><h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-faculty-of-1000">9. What are your responsibilities at Faculty of 1000?</h3><p>Well, my job title is ‘Information Architect’, which means quite a bit more than ‘web manager’. I have overall responsibility for the presentation of the F1000 service, and I have to ensure that the web site is fast and intuitive, and that the content is suitable for both medics and biologists. I’m also keen to keep F1000 relevant in the Web 2.0 world.</p><h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-for-faculty-of-1000">10. What did you do before starting to work for Faculty of 1000?</h3><p>I was at the University of Sydney for three years, the token cell biologist in an NMR lab, looking at RNA-binding zinc fingers. Before that I was at the MRC-LMB in Cambridge for six years, learning how to do X-ray crystallography and NMR and applying those techniques to cell biological questions.</p><h3 id="11-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-faculty-of-1000">11. Do you want to talk about future plans for Faculty of 1000?</h3><p>As I’ve sorted of already hinted, we’re in the middle of a major redesign. We have some new features that I hope you’ll find very exciting — one of which I really can’t talk about yet! — including forums, a re-vamped ‘MyF1000′ site, integration of F1000 Reports, more systematic literature scanning, talking to social media sites, RSS (at last!), a blog, and a lot of behind the scenes tweaks.</p><h3 id="12-where-can-we-provide-feedback-about-faculty-of-1000">12. Where can we provide feedback about Faculty of 1000?</h3><p>Write to me! Or email info@f1000.com. The new site will also have a feedback form.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that we have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/15/reference-manager-overview">number of online reference managers to choose from</a>, I thought it would be interesting to look at their popularity – both in absolute numbers of visitors and the in changes during the last 12 months. Online tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a> allow everybody to do just that, and their basic functions are free to use. I've picked <em><em>unique visitors</em></em>, but there are of course other statistics to look at, including total number of visits.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a> is the most popular online reference manager, and it is obvious that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.springer-sbm.com/index.php?id=291&amp;backPID=13041&amp;L=0&amp;tx_tnc_news=4739&amp;cHash=56bfa6b56c">announcement by Springer to sponsor them</a> last August has helped their site traffic. Only CiteULike and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.labmeeting.com/">Labmeeting</a> show a significant increase in unique visitors in the last 6 months.</p><p>The statistics are more complicated for tools that include both a desktop client and online database (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>) and these numbers should be interpreted with caution. I've included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a> in both graphs for better comparison. It is probably safe to say that both Endnoteweb and the online version of Mendeley are not as popular as the online only reference managers in the first graph. This could either mean that online only tools are far more popular than desktop applications (which I doubt) or that most references are still primarily stored in desktop programs and not shared online. Something that Eva Amsen already described last year (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog/2008/08/19/how-to-get-scientists-to-adopt-web-2-0-technologies">How to get scientists to adopt web 2.0 technologies</a>). To put these numbers into perspective: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a> (the home of PubMed and other NCBI databases) sees about 2.5 million unique visitors a month.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A recent <em><em>Nature News</em></em> article by Geoff Brumfiel (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/full/458274a.html">Science journalism: Supplanting the old media?</a>) has stirred up many interesting discussions about the relationship of science blogging and traditional science journalism. Good starting places to follow these discussions (and engage in them) are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://technorati.com/search/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/full/458274a.html">Technorati</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://blogs.nature.com/stories/858">Nature.com Blogs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://friendfeed.com/e/4f3817ea-f82c-3a94-4e1c-3368926a24ed/Defining-the-Journalism-vs-Blogging-Debate-with-a/">FriendFeed</a>.</p><p>Science blogging extends, but also threatens traditional science journalism. At the same time, aggregators and microblogging services such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> also are both an enhancementent and a threat to science blogs. Instead of writing blog posts or commenting on them, many science bloggers spend increasing amounts of time with these services, e.g. in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://friendfeed.com/rooms/the-life-scientists">The Life Scientists</a> room on FriendFeed.</p><p>But microblogging and aggregation services have also emerged as new tools for another area of science communication, namely the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/index.html">peer review</a> process. The interaction between authors and editors or editors and reviewers traditionally happens via email (because peer review is usually anonymous, authors don't communicate directly with reviewers). Twitter and similar tools fullfill the requirement for privacy (in the form of direct messages and private rooms and special services for organizations such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a>).</p><p>What are the advantages of these tools for the peer review process? All communications can be stored in one place in the form of a discussion thread. FriendFeed and Facebook allow users to mark posts they like and this can show agreement between reviewers. Messages can also be sent to and from non-traditional devices such as cell phones. Many senior researchers are already overworked with peer review, so this way they can at least post their reviews from the golf course or their yacht. And authors want to learn about their accepted paper as soon as possible, and this is not necessarily when they sit in front of their computer.</p><p>But most importantly, microblogging enforces brevity. Virginia Walbot recently complained in a <em><em>Journal of Biology</em></em> comment (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/jbiol125">Are we training pit bulls to review our manuscripts?</a>) about reviewers</p><blockquote><em><em>dismissing the years of labor and stating that the manuscript can only be reconsidered with substantially more data providing definitive proof of each claim</em></em>.</blockquote><p>As Twitter messages (also known as tweets) can only be 140 characters long, reviewers are forced to write short reviews, and editors to write short notes to the authors. And if the 140 characters aren't enough, they can always point to other places with services like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://bit.ly/5gfc9">bit.ly</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130im_/http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3463/3402929290_6e010842b6.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure>]]></content>

        <updated>2009-03-25T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Practically all scientific journals now use web-based systems for paper submissions and peer review. This saves the authors a lot of time compared to paper submissions by postal mail (until 15 years ago) or email (until 5 years ago). Unfortunately the submission process is still far from perfect and requires authors to spend many hours formatting manuscripts, references and images instead of focusing on the scientific content.</p><p>The tools (word processors, reference managers, graphics programs, etc.) that most authors use to write manuscripts have become more sophisticated every year, but often don't help much with creating structured documents. Structure is the most important feature of a scientific manuscript (title, authors, abstract, materials and methods, references, etc.), and this is much more relevant than the layout (fonts, page margins, etc.).</p><p>There are two different approaches to create structured manuscripts. Authors could use tools such as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/07/interview-with-pablo-fernicola">Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-in</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/27/lemon8-xml-interview-with-mj-suhonos">Lemon8-XML</a> and submit structured manuscripts in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM DTD</a> XML format. Or journal submission systems could improve the process of creating structured manuscripts from standard word processor files (e.g. Microsoft Word). To better understand the second option, I asked Richard Wynne from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/about.html">Aries</a> a few questions about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/home.htm">Editorial Manager</a>.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-editorial-manager-is-and-does"><em><em>1. Can you describe what Editorial Manager is and does?</em></em></h3><p>Editorial Manager is like plumbing for scholarly publishing. It manages the flow of scholarly manuscripts from submission to acceptance. Like good plumbing it should be invisible, reliable and afford some luxury.</p><p>While most of us could theoretically do our own plumbing, we usually discover that it's better to pay a professional. It's the same with online peer review systems. Most scholarly societies, publishers and university presses could develop and host their own workflow systems; but have discovered that it's less messy and less expensive to use a commercial solution such as Editorial Manager.</p><p>More than 3,100 journals from 150 publishers have adopted Editorial Manager. In the interest of fairness, I should mention other available solutions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">Open Journal Systems</a>,</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://scholarone.com/products/manuscript/">Manuscript Central</a>,</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.ejpress.com/index.shtml">eJournal Press</a>,</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://benchpress.highwire.org/">BenchPress</a>.</li></ul><p>Thanks to a healthy competitive environment, online peer review is one of the most innovative areas of scholarly publishing.</p><h3 id="2-in-what-document-formats-can-manuscripts-be-submitted-to-editorial-manager-can-manuscripts-be-submitted-from-online-word-processors-such-as-google-docs">2. In what document formats can manuscripts be submitted to Editorial Manager? Can manuscripts be submitted from online word processors such as Google Docs?</h3><p>There are virtually no technical limitations on the types of files that can be loaded into Editorial Manager. However:</p><ul><li>Only some file types (such as Office, LaTeX, and image formats etc.) can be automatically converted to PDF format. Other types of file (e.g. Video or audio files) can be uploaded and are accessible during workflow from links in the generated PDF, and from the manuscript file inventory for authorized editors.</li><li>Superimposed on this technical handling is journal policy. Acceptable submission items (e.g. manuscript, data set etc.) are configured by the journal according to their idiosyncratic workflow preferences. So while one journal using Editorial Manager may permit the upload of supplemental data, another may choose not to make this option available.</li></ul><p>We have not interfaced with Google Docs at an API level, but this would become a priority if large numbers of authors found it a productive authoring tool for scholarly manuscripts. In the interim Google Docs provides many supported download file format options such as RTF.</p><h3 id="3-why-do-most-publishers-prefer-not-to-have-manuscripts-submitted-as-pdf-file-s-">3. Why do most publishers prefer not to have manuscripts submitted as PDF file(s)?</h3><p>Editorial Manager does support upload of manuscripts in PDF format. However many publishers discourage this practice for good reasons:</p><ul><li>Some journals ask reviewers to directly edit the manuscript in word processing format – obviously not possible if the author uploads a PDF.</li><li>If the manuscript is accepted, the publisher will need access to original source files to undertake copy editing, image formatting, composition etc. Obtaining source files up-front allows the publisher to accelerate the workflow and eliminates the time-consuming and cumbersome step of obtaining source files from the author after acceptance. Publishers that do accept PDF submissions must ensure that subsequently submitted source files match the revised manuscript that was accepted by the editors as an error prone and unnecessary step.</li></ul><p>It's unfortunate that publishers don't take the time to explain their reasoning regarding PDF submissions. This contributes to the scholar street wisdom that publishers are out of touch.</p><h3 id="4-can-manuscripts-be-transferred-from-preprint-servers-such-as-arxiv-or-nature-preceedings">4. Can manuscripts be transferred from preprint servers such as arXiv or Nature Preceedings?</h3><p>Yes, manuscripts can be directly transferred from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> server by entering the appropriate arXiv number during the submission process. Editorial Manager then automatically collects the source files from the arXiv server. The feature is journal configurable.<br>We have not yet implemented a similar feature for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>.</p><h3 id="5-how-does-editorial-manager-support-the-nlm-dtd-format-can-manuscripts-be-submitted-in-that-format">5. How does Editorial Manager support the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM DTD</a> format? Can manuscripts be submitted in that format?</h3><p>Editorial Manager does process files with structured DTDs, but that's not really the point of your question. Here's the issue: reliably structured manuscripts theoretically present workflow benefits:</p><ul><li>During submission, manuscript metadata could be automatically harvested from the file, thereby avoiding author re-keying of title, abstract, etc.</li><li>Journal styling and composition could be applied automatically, thereby avoiding manual steps currently required to structure unformatted manuscripts – a massive cost and time saving.</li></ul><p>Today these benefits remain largely theoretical because they depend entirely on authors uploading standardized, structured manuscripts. The question is: who should have ultimate responsibility for manuscript structure quality? In my opinion not authors – their primary focus should be manuscript content not manuscript format. Part of the publisher's role is to take care of manuscript structuring. Trying to offload this responsibility to authors is not a good use of their time.</p><p>Eventually authoring tools could solve the problem by enabling transparent insertion of structure during manuscript authoring, but initiatives in this area are still immature in terms of technical feasibility, operational convenience and economic sustainability. Until this changes, weâ€™re focused on adding server-side tools to Editorial Manager that donâ€™t place any extra technical or financial burden on the author.</p><h3 id="6-does-editorial-manager-help-with-the-formatting-of-bibliographies-e-g-by-checking-the-references-against-online-databases-or-the-formatting-of-references-in-the-journal-style">6. Does Editorial Manager help with the formatting of bibliographies, e.g. by checking the references against online databases or the formatting of references in the journal style?</h3><p>Yes, Editorial Manager provides this facility, but format styles are determined by the individual journals/publishers that use the system.</p><p>Journals can select an Editorial Manager option that automatically links author submitted bibliographies to PubMed and/or CrossRef. The system can also format the author's bibliography to journal style. This means that we broadly accept whatever style the author has used. We power the service with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.inera.com/extylesinfo.shtml">eXtyles</a>. The output of the process is clean XML of the bibliography.</p><p>This is an excellent example of how Editorial Manager improves workflow without displacing work back to the author. Alternative approaches are burdensome to the author because they require her to pre-format the bibliography or mandate the purchase/use of reference management tools and plug-ins.</p><h3 id="7-what-is-the-preferred-format-for-graphics-can-editorial-manager-help-with-conversions-into-a-different-format-e-g-tiff-to-pdf-">7. What is the preferred format for graphics? Can Editorial Manager help with conversions into a different format (e.g. TIFF to PDF)?</h3><p>Editorial Manager has no preferred graphic format. The preference is determined by the journal/publisher using the system.</p><p>Preferences are the result of the publisher's production and content delivery objectives. For example, a journal that re-draws graphics may not care about format. A journal that produces high quality print may reject RGB images, but RGB images would typically be acceptable for an online-only journal.</p><p>Editorial Manager does include an automatic image checking option. Journals that configure this feature can provide feedback to authors concerning the acceptability of submitted images. Just to be clear, this tool provides feedback and education, it does not prevent submission.</p><h3 id="8-does-editorial-manager-support-the-sword-simple-web-service-offering-repository-deposit-protocol">8. Does Editorial Manager support the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.elearning.ac.uk/features/sword">SWORD</a> (Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit) protocol?</h3><p>Back in 2002 Aries proposed an XML-based standard and anticipated that the “Submission and Manuscript eXchange Format” (SMXF) would provide a system-neutral standard for the exchange of manuscript metadata and content . The broad adoption of such a standard would provide key benefits (see 2002 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/press-releases/200211.pdf">Press Release</a>). Despite our best efforts, there was little interest at the time, and as a consequence Editorial Manager supports dozens of XML input/output formats. So, from our point of view, the emergence of a standardized manuscript transfer format is a great boon and I've no doubt that SWORD deposit will soon be an Editorial Manager feature.</p><h3 id="9-how-can-authors-give-feedback-e-g-to-report-problems-or-request-features">9. How can authors give feedback, e.g. to report problems or request features?</h3><p>Most user feedback comes indirectly via publishers so that they can filter editorial and policy questions. However, we are also happy to hear suggestions directly from users. They can reach us at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/mailto:marketing%40edmgr.com">marketing@edmgr.com</a>. Users are also invited to talk to their journals/publishers about participating in User Group meetings (London and Boston) or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/emdiscussion.html">Listserv</a> discussions.</p><h3 id="10-what-are-your-responsibilities-within-the-editorial-manager-team">10. What are your responsibilities within the Editorial Manager team?</h3><p>A distinguishing characteristic of Editorial Manager is that it is genuinely the result of a broad-based team effort. I joined Aries approximately 10 years ago and have been privileged to participate in the growth of Editorial Manger from idea to sustainable solution processing more than 1,000,000 submissions per year. Along the way I have forged key relationships, and led the product management, sales and marketing team.</p><h3 id="11-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-in-the-editorial-manager-team">11. What did you do before starting to work in the Editorial Manager team?</h3><p>After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, I started my career in software but jumped at the opportunity to start a multimedia company for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://www.ovid.com/site/products/tools/silverplatter/access_tools.jsp">SilverPlatter</a> in the early 90's. Working with scientists we published interactive video, audio, graphics and text on CD-ROM. In those days few scientists owned CD-ROM drives so I'd carry one around with me. At one point I remember a professor at Cornell excitedly showing me something called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908031524/http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">Mosaic</a> and thinking: that's just hypertext. Since then I have been a lot more inquisitive about innovations that originate in academia!</p><h3 id="12-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-editorial-manager">12. Do you want to talk about future plans for Editorial Manager?</h3><p>There are many opportunities to innovate and improve the experience for authors, reviewers and editors; and we work on a rich list of suggestions and enhancements. We do not announce innovation details until they are close to being deployed, but there are a couple of great releases coming this year.</p><p>Recently we received the following comment form an editor: Editorial Manger has the “feel” of actually responding to the user. I think that a number of subtleties account for this impression, including the language used, the flow of the algorithm, and the customized real time feedback to the user. Our ambition is to achieve and surpass this level of satisfaction for all users.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Citations of the relevant literature are an essential feature of scientific papers.

I expect the Word for Macintosh support of both these tools to become better over time. Google Docs doesn't have any reference manager integration. This greatly limits its usefulness for writing scientific papers. The RefWorks plugin connects to an online database, so you can't add or edit references without an internet connection.</p><p>Most word processor plugins add an extra menu that allows to add and edit citations (allowing the user to search the reference manager database), and to add and edit bibliographies (allowing the user to pick a citation style, see below). Most reference managers also allow scanning for reference tags in documents produced by other word processors (e.g. in the .rtf format), but that process requires a few extra steps.</p><h3 id="support-for-your-favorite-journal">Support for your favorite journal</h3><p>I think it is very unfortunate that paper authors have to deal with a large number of different citation styles. All that we really need for paper references is the DOI (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/455708a">doi:10.1038/455708a</a>) to make the reference automatically identifiable and some basic information (authors, title, journal, year, issue) to make the reference readable. But it is beyond my understanding why anybody would care about formatting details such as whether the pulication year appears before or after the journal name. There have been initiatives to standardize the formatting of references (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/citingmedicine/">Citing Medicine</a>), but for now paper authors have to format their bibliographies in the style required by the journal. Citation styles are an important asset for those that write reference manager software. Many people will recall that Thomson Reuters (who makes Endnote) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7214/full/455708a.html">sued</a> George Mason University (who makes Zotero) last year, because Zotero added a feature that could convert Endnote .ens citation style files into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/csl/">Citation Style Language</a> .csl files. Mendeley is also using .csl for citation styles.</p><h3 id="is-there-a-better-way">Is there a better way?</h3><p>Word processor plugins are fragile and usually break when a new software version is released (see for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://www.endnote.com/support/en_wpchart_mac.asp">this chart</a> for Endnote and Word for Macintosh). Native word processor support for references allows a much tighter integration into the word processor interface. Lastly, documents produced by different reference managers are not interchangeable, as each plugin uses a slightly different formatting approach. This means you can't write on a paper using Endnote and send it to your coauthor who uses Zotero.</p><p>The latest versions of Microsoft Word (2007 and 2008 Macintosh) have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://blogs.msdn.com/joe_friend/archive/2006/07/13/664960.aspx">built-In support for citations and bibliographies</a>, but this feature is severely limited for the requirements of academic papers. Only a handful of citation styles are supported, adding more styles is possible but requires <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://blogs.msdn.com/microsoft_office_word/archive/2007/12/14/bibliography-citations-1011.aspx">some serious skills in XML editing</a>. References are stored in one flat file (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/https://www.uwec.edu/help/Word07/bib-srcfile.htm">Sources.xml</a>) and can't be searched. OpenOffice is also struggling with built-in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/">bibliographic support</a>.</p><p>LaTex has long included support for references using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://www.bibtex.org/About">BibTex</a> and shows how citation support should be done. Tools like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://jabref.sourceforge.net/">JabRef</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a> extend this functionality, and most reference managers will import/export bibtex files.</p><p>Both Microsoft Word and OpenOffice should open up their citation APIs to third-party tools. This would create better citation tools, allows the easier exchange of documents between authors (journal submissions), and would it make easier for smaller tools such as Papers to integrate with word processors (a workaround is described <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://vnoel.wordpress.com/2008/02/14/papers-word-2008-bibliography-heaven/">here</a>). If they wait too long, we will probably see the online word processors such as Google Docs, Zoho Writer start adding an API for citations and bibliographies and all of the sudden become very serious alternatives for writing scientific papers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104449/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/27/lemon8-xml-interview-with-mj-suhonos">Lemon8-XML</a> already has very good bibliography support.</p><p><em><em>P.S.

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/zotero-interview-with-trevor-owens"/>
        <updated>2009-03-04T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is a reference manager built as an extension of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/">Firefox</a> web browser. The best introduction to Zotero is probably this short video.</p><p>Last week the newest version (1.5 beta) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-15-beta-released-join-us-in-the-clouds/">was announced</a> on the Zotero blog. Among the most exciting new features is the synchronization of library data with the Zotero server, which in the future will allow a lot of interesting social features. I asked <em><em>Trevor Owens</em></em> from Zotero a few questions about Zotero, particularly some of the new features.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-zotero-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what Zotero is and does?</h3><p>Zotero is an easy-to-use yet powerful research tool that helps you gather, organize, and analyze sources (citations, full texts, web pages, images, and other objects), and lets you share the results of your research in a variety of ways. An extension to the popular open-source web browser Firefox, Zotero includes the best parts of older reference manager software — the ability to store author, title, and publication fields and to export that information as formatted references — and the best parts of modern software and web applications (like iTunes and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.delicious.com/">del.icio.us</a>), such as the ability to interact, tag, and search in advanced ways. Zotero integrates tightly with online resources; it can sense when users are viewing a book, article, or other object on the web, and on most major research and library sites it will find and automatically save the full reference information for the item. Since it lives in the web browser, it can effortlessly transmit information to, and receive information from, other web services and applications; since it runs on one's personal computer, it can also communicate with software running there (such as Microsoft Word). And it can be used offline as well (e.g., on a plane, in an archive without WiFi).</p><h3 id="2-why-is-zotero-a-firefox-plugin-and-not-a-desktop-application">2. Why is Zotero a Firefox plugin and not a desktop application?</h3><p>For most researchers the web is the first and primary point of entry for their research process. We thought it would be ideal to integrate Zotero as tightly as possible with the interface researchers already use to interact with the the journals, libraries, and databases they regularly consult.</p><h3 id="3-why-is-zotero-a-firefox-plugin-and-not-a-web-based-application">3. Why is Zotero a Firefox plugin and not a web-based application?</h3><p>Two reasons, first as a extension Zotero can sit alongside any page a researcher visits. Many of our users will keep Zotero partway open as they work on research online, allowing them to organize and annotate their research without leaving the page they are on. Second, as an extension users have full access to their collections when they are offline. This is particularly important for researchers working in remote locations or with flakey connections. For example, researchers working in offline archives can manually add items and attach scans and photos. If you're writing a paper on a plane you can add citations to your documents. In short being inside the browser gives us the best of both worlds. Zotero offers direct connectivity to web content, while still always remaining accessible. The last thing I would note is that Zotero is rapidly becoming a web application. With our newest release users can browse and share their collections online and in the near future users will be able to further manipulate their collections through our web application.</p><h3 id="4-did-you-consider-google-gears-for-offline-access">4. Did you consider Google Gears for offline access?</h3><p>Both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> and Zotero rely on a local instance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.sqlite.org/about.html">sqlite</a> for data storage, but Zotero predates Gears by over a year. Google Gears is intended more to synchronize a web application for offline use, while Zotero fundamentally is a research database that users expect to be able to interact with fully regardless of their network connectivity.</p><h3 id="5-does-zotero-work-with-google-docs">5. Does Zotero work with Google Docs?</h3><p>Yes, users can drag and drop citations and bibliographic entries into google documents, or for that matter any sort of text field. We have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_and_google_tools">short screencast</a> which demos this functionality.</p><h3 id="6-can-you-briefly-describe-the-citation-style-language-csl-">6. Can you briefly describe the Citation Style Language (CSL)?</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/creating_citation_styles">CSL</a> is an XML language for citation formatting. It is designed to provide a nice balance between power and ease-of-use. It is also designed to be independent of any particular application, document format, or programming language.</p><h3 id="7-how-can-zotero-users-share-their-references-with-others">7. How can Zotero users share their references with others?</h3><p>At the moment users can export collections and libraries and email them to associates. Users can also share their library online, and by next week users will be able to import references directly from any users shared library. By next month users will be able to create groups for more seamless sharing of references and attachments.</p><h3 id="8-for-zotero-2-0-you-plan-to-offer-users-the-ability-to-share-collections-with-others-through-the-zotero-server-is-there-a-difference-to-similar-services-e-g-connotea-citeulike-or-mendeley-and-do-you-plan-integration-with-them">8. For Zotero 2.0 you plan to offer users the ability to share collections with others through the Zotero Server. Is there a difference to similar services (e.g. Connotea, CiteULike or Mendeley) and do you plan integration with them?</h3><p>In many ways the collaborative features currently in the works for Zotero are similar to the other services you mention. I think the biggest difference is the way in which sharing collections through groups will be tightly coupled into the Zotero client, and writing applications through our Word and Open Office plugins. The social and collaborative features we are launching directly connect into our hundreds of thousands of users' existing workflows. Zotero is also a non-commercial, open-source project directed by academics who are committed to enabling scholarship. Finally, Zotero is oriented toward storing anything related to your research (papers, books, audio, video, datasets, images, etc) while other solutions are almost entirely oriented toward working with research papers.</p><h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-within-the-zotero-project">9. What are your responsibilities within the Zotero project?</h3><p>Over the last two years as the community lead and evangelist I have been responsible for spreading the word about Zotero through workshops and presentations at conferences and institutions, as well as helping support the ever growing community of users, evangelists, and developers through Zotero's forums and by writing a majority of Zotero's user documentation.</p><h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-on-zotero">10. What did you do before starting to work on Zotero?</h3><p>Before working on Zotero I worked as the press coordinator for the Games Learning and Society Conference in Madison and as a Academic Advisor at the University of Wisconsin. My undergraduate degree is in the History of Science.</p><h3 id="11-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-zotero">11. Do you want to talk about future plans for Zotero?</h3><p>You can consult our development roadmap online <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.zotero.org/support/development_roadmap">here</a>. Beyond that I would recommend taking a look at the work we are doing with the internet archive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.dancohen.org/2007/12/12/zotero-and-the-internet-archive-join-forces/">here</a>. Once you take a look at those I would be happy to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906100323/http://www.zotero.org/support/contact_us">answer any questions</a> that come up.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finishing an exciting research project and writing it up in a paper are the first two steps in getting your work published. The next two steps – submitting your paper to a journal and getting it through the review process – have changed dramatically in the last 10-15 years. No longer do we have to print out our manuscript using one of the few available laser printers in the department, paste our gel pictures on cardboard and number the figures with Letraset. And then send it off with the mail. And then repeat the process for every revision of the manuscript.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/2276034665_456342fb50_c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="800" height="800"><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/synaptichappenings/2276034665/">Flickr Photo</a> by synaptic.happenings.</figcaption></figure><p>Now of course we submit our manuscripts online using a manuscript submission system such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/home.htm">Editorial Manager</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.ejpress.com/index.shtml">eJournalPress</a>. Which is not to say that the process is necessarily easy or fun. Many of us can tell stories of spending hours or whole days until the manuscript is finally submitted. We struggle with the conversion of the different parts of the manuscript into a single PDF file, have problems with fonts, have to deal with different graphics formats (e.g. PDF, JPEG, EPS, TIFF), don’t use the correct style for our references, etc.</p><p>The flip side of this is the time and money spent at the journal to format your accepted manuscript into something that can be turned into a journal article published online or in print.</p><p>Some of these problems wouldn’t exist if we used a common document format for manuscript writing, manuscript revisions and manuscript printing and online viewing. That common document format does exist and is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">NLM Journal Publishing DTD</a> (and no, it’s not LaTex). This document format is used in the workflow of many journals, but until now has rarely been used by authors. Last November <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/07/interview-with-pablo-fernicola">I talked with Pablo Fermicola</a> about a free tool that allows Microsoft Word to save manuscripts in that format (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.microsoft.com/DOWNLOADS/details.aspx?FamilyID=09c55527-0759-4d6d-ae02-51e90131997e&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft Word Authoring Add-In</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.inera.com/extylesinfo.shtml#NLM">eXtyles NLM</a> is another tool for Microsoft Word with similar functionality.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8">Lemon8-XML</a> takes a different approach in helping academic authors convert their manuscripts into the NLM DTD format. Version 1.0 of the software <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/node/1891">was released today</a>, so this was a great opportunity to talk with the lead developer <em><em>MJ Suhonos</em></em> about Lemon8-XML.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-lemon8-xml-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what Lemon8-XML is and does?</h3><p>Lemon8-XML is a freely-available, open source web application that aims to help academic authors and editors convert scholarly articles from layout formats like Microsoft Word to structured XML formats without requiring a great deal of knowledge of XML or the schema that they’re working with. It’s based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://opendocument.xml.org/overview">OpenDocument</a> format internally, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">NLM Journal Publishing DTD</a> as the default export format.</p><p>Originally, Lemon8-XML came from a bunch of scripts that performed a series of tasks:</p><ul><li>convert an author’s article from a myriad of document formats to OpenDocument,</li><li>parse the article and try to extract metadata, determine section structure based on layout information, and parse citations into their disparate elements,</li><li>export this semantic data as XML.</li></ul><p>The work to date on Lemon8-XML has been building these functions into an easy-to-use web UI that also provides some editing facilities; for example, to fix problems from incomplete or incorrect parsing. One of the most promising features of Lemon8-XML is its ability to parse citations in a wide range of formats, and automatically try to correct or enhance them by searching for their complete records in, eg. PubMed, CrossRef, and WorldCat.</p><h3 id="2-what-are-the-advantages-of-using-lemon8-xml-over-traditional-word-processors-such-as-microsoft-word">2. What are the advantages of using Lemon8-XML over traditional word processors such as Microsoft Word?</h3><p>I should start by clarifying that Lemon8-XML wasn’t really intended to be used as a word processor, but rather a conversion tool to be used after the writing was done. This was to fit in with existing practices, where authors upload papers to a journal and the editing is done afterwards. Of course, the advent of online word processors challenges this notion, and has caused us to think differently about the editing aspects of Lemon8-XML. Cross-platform deployment and online collaboration are things that obviously the web is great for. An author could, for example, upload a paper to Lemon8-XML, and work together with an editor on that same copy, regardless of what desktop tools they have. One advantage of this idea is that the burden of work is shared between more people, whether that’s an author and a copyeditor, or multiple editors. This is a big deal for small journals who don’t have funds for dedicated staff.</p><p>Within PKP in general, we also try to keep the requirements for our software as low as possible, both technically and financially. So, for journals like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.openmedicine.ca/">Open Medicine</a>, who are entirely volunteer-run, paying $230 per copy for Microsoft Word on each computer actually represents a significant cost. Using OpenOffice on the desktop and a single copy of Lemon8-XML on a server — both of which are free — lets them spend this out-of-pocket expense on other things to keep their journal alive and growing. Microsoft Word also has an unfortunate history of being variable and inconsistent across platforms and versions. We wanted to help people escape that, which is one of the reasons for converting everything to OpenDocument as early as possible. In addition, stewarding documents through an online workflow can be a laborious and frustrating process, so the possibility for journals to make the editing process more centralized and interactive by integrating Lemon8-XML is a compelling one.</p><h3 id="3-how-does-lemon8-xml-compare-to-the-microsoft-word-article-authoring-add-in-that-also-produces-nlm-journal-publishing-dtd-output">3. How does Lemon8-XML compare to the Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-In, that also produces NLM Journal Publishing DTD output?</h3><p>In many ways, we’re working in parallel with Pablo Fermicola’s group at Microsoft — <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://perspectives.on10.net/blogs/jonudell/Word-for-scientific-publishing/">they’re basically building an editor</a> for placing a structured NLM schema on top of the Microsoft WordML (DOCX) XML format, while Lemon8-XML places the NLM schema on top of the OpenDocument (ODT) XML format. Of course, there’s nothing saying that Lemon8-XML couldn’t be modified to read DOCX files generated with the Article Authoring Add-In or vice-versa. This difference is really a reflection of the two competing standards, and the tools they use, with the same ultimate goal: to allow users to generate semantically-structured documents from layout-based ones. In addition, the Article Authoring Add-In is built on Microsoft Word 2007 as a platform, which I think has some limitations; for example, most of the PKP team don’t use Windows, so the Article Authoring Add-In is basically inaccessible to us. But overall, our goals appear to be very similar.</p><p>To my mind, the main difference between the projects is in how they approach the user: the Article Authoring Add-In presents new tools for adding semantic mark-up in a (somewhat) familiar interface; many authors are already familiar with Microsoft Word and are comfortable working in that environment. My concern with this approach is that it still has strong ties to the layout paradigm, so, for example, marking text as “article title” may not be sufficiently different in authors’ minds from marking text as “16 point bold”. I also think the idea of presenting an entire document in a single free-form editor reinforces the layout paradigm, as opposed to identifying the distinct elements which comprise a scholarly article. Lemon8-XML, on the other hand, builds from these individual elements, and assembles them within the user interface based on their structural relations. You can see this reflected in the tabs in the current interface: “Metadata, Sections, Citations” — these are the front, body, back matter of an article.</p><p>This places restrictions on how a user can edit their article, which is sometimes frustrating, but it forces them to think about what they’re doing and the meaning of their content: why do I have to place it here, what content is valid in this element, etc. In a future version, this will all be on the same web page, similar to how it would appear in Microsoft Word, but again with the semantic structure visually enforced instead of being totally free-form.</p><h3 id="4-what-is-the-difference-between-lemon8-xml-and-online-word-processors-such-as-google-docs">4. What is the difference between Lemon8-XML and online word processors such as Google Docs?</h3><p>Unlike most word processor software, Lemon8-XML is built around the semantic notion of a document, not its appearance. We wanted to help people begin to think about the meaning and structure of their articles, not just whether they look good on the screen or as a PDF. It turns out this is a tough challenge, though — people have a hard time with WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) editors, and there’s often a lot of complex structure to present visually for editing. One thing people seem to be comfortable with, or at least used to, is entering metadata and information in web forms, so much of the Lemon8-XML user interface is built that way.</p><p>Lemon8-XML is also specifically aimed at modeling and editing scholarly articles, which have a long history of practice and some very rigid conventions that aren’t applicable more broadly. This means it’s not a general-purpose editor like most word processors, but that also means we can focus on the specific things it should do, and refine them rather than trying to please everyone and falling victim to feature-creep.</p><h3 id="5-why-did-you-pick-the-nlm-journal-publishing-dtd-as-document-format">5. Why did you pick the NLM Journal Publishing DTD as document format?</h3><p>I did a survey in 2003 of available DTDs to represent scholarly journal articles, looking for something I could use as a common source for generating HTML and PDF. I selected the NLM DTD above the others (eg. BioMed Central, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.docbook.org/whatis">DocBook</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.erudit.org/apropos/info.html">Erudit</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">Text Encoding Initiative</a>) since it seemed to strike a good balance between comprehensiveness and granularity; it can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be. It also had a very thorough citation model and a modular design, so extensibility wasn’t a concern — I liked the “journal articles plus” concept that it was built with. And, of course, being stewarded by the National Library of Medicine meant it would likely be well-maintained and remain open. The fact that it became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/about/faq.html#q21">the central XML standard for PubMed Central as an archival format</a> was just icing on the cake.</p><p>Another reason is that, among the STM journals at least, a lot of established practice has developed around generating HTML and PDF from NLM XML specifically, and we want to support that. Actually, we want to expand adoption of the NLM DTD by making it accessible to humanities and social science journals, as well. The information contained in the XML is essentially identical regardless of subject, which means we just need to develop discipline-specific rendering; for example, for different citation styles. I think there’s an incredible amount of room for growth and improvement in this area in particular.</p><h3 id="6-does-lemon8-xml-integrate-with-manuscript-submission-systems-such-as-open-journal-systems">6. Does Lemon8-XML integrate with manuscript submission systems such as Open Journal Systems?</h3><p>Not yet, but that’s the next major area of development immediately following the 1.0 release. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">OJS</a> has been so successful, one of our biggest challenges has been keeping it flexible enough to support a wide range of workflows, and we want to continue with that by taking as much of the technology from Lemon8-XML as possible and folding it into OJS. I don’t know if we’ll see a side-by-side kind of integration immediately, but rather strategic enhancements of certain aspects of OJS: automatic document conversion, annotation directly within articles, extraction and stripping of metadata to improve blindedness, automatically parsing and linking citations, etc. By going this way, we give users the ability to choose specific features that are useful for them, and at the same time build upon the huge community that already exists for OJS in terms of development, testing, and feedback.</p><p>There’s definitely still value in a stand-alone Lemon8-XML for cases where people don’t want journal workflow, or where they’re integrating with a different kind of system. So, we will be working on a Lemon8-XML 2.0 that’s built on the same modular, reliable framework as the rest of the PKP suite, and back-porting code from OJS.</p><h3 id="7-what-is-the-public-knowledge-project">7. What is the Public Knowledge Project?</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/node/1410">PKP</a> is a small research group distributed between Simon Fraser University, University of British Columbia, Stanford University and Arizona State University that has been quietly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/276">developing open source software for online publishing and knowledge sharing</a> for the past 10 years, under the direction of Dr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://ed.stanford.edu/suse/faculty/displayRecord.php?suid=willinsk">John Willinsky</a> at Stanford. Our major aim is to provide tools for improving access to academic research, as well as helping improve the quality and efficiency of its production. Our philosophy is also to create partnerships between researchers, librarians, publishers, to help them build sustainable and globally accessible scholarly infrastructure. In my mind, it’s also about giving people options and choices aside from what’s being offered commercially, especially to those who can’t afford them, like a lot of developing-world journals.</p><p>We have four applications in addition to Lemon8-XML: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">Open Journal Systems</a>, our most popular, is being used by over 2500 journals in over 50 countries. We also produce a conference management system (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ocs">Open Conference Systems</a>), an OAI metadata indexing system (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=harvester">Open Archives Harvester</a>), and a monograph publishing system (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp">Open Monograph Press</a>), currently under development. All of our software is freely available under the GPL open source license, and we have an active community of over 1500 users. We’ve worked with small, volunteer-run humanities journals, to major international society conferences, to high-profile, ISI-ranked medical journals.</p><h3 id="8-what-are-your-responsibilities-within-the-lemon8-xml-project">8. What are your responsibilities within the Lemon8-XML project?</h3><p>Because our group’s so small, we all share responsibilities — there are only a handful of people to do almost all of the development, and that’s in addition to handling the support, correspondence, and software maintenance of the rest of the PKP suite, not to mention providing various international workshops. So, we often divvy roles based on expertise or interest. Since bringing Lemon8-XML to PKP, I do the vast majority of Lemon8-XML development, but I also manage collaborations with our development and research partners, and write white papers on the software design we use to share our ideas, on top of contributing to the daily stuff above.</p><p>Probably the biggest struggle in developing Lemon8-XML has been that it’s one person, about half-time, doing all of the coding, testing, etc. We already have a number of very exciting partnerships with groups who will be testing and providing feedback, and have contributed a talented developer who’s recently started half-time as well. Of course, we can always use more help with the coding side of things. Our team is quite spread-out geographically, so we have a lot of experience with working across time zones and with distributed development practices. I’m hoping that after the 1.0 release, more people will become interested and will want to help get involved. Whether contributing plugins for citation processing, or helping us improve the UI — really, anything that helps the software grow will benefit more authors and editors, which is the main goal.</p><h3 id="9-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-on-lemon8-xml">9. What did you do before starting to work on Lemon8-XML?</h3><p>I worked for a two-person medical informatics journal that was publishing around 50 articles a year using Microsoft FrontPage and managed entirely via email. My job was to transition it to an online manuscript management system (naturally, I chose OJS), convert around 300 back articles from FrontPage HTML into valid NLM XML, develop a custom rendering system that would create HTML and PDF galleys from that XML, get the journal accepted into PubMed Central, and establish an impact factor from ISI (which is now 3.0) — oh, and continue publishing 50 articles a year. The journal also ran an international medical conference during that time (using OCS). Three years later, I left to do my Masters degree in Library/Information Studies, during which time I joined PKP and started working on Lemon8-XML, based on a lot of the things I’d learned from my time at the journal.</p><h3 id="10-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-lemon8-xml">10. Do you want to talk about future plans for Lemon8-XML?</h3><p>The most common question I’m asked is, “when will it be ready?”, which for many people really means, “when will it be a one-click magic bullet for getting my journal into PubMed Central?”. I’m proud of the Lemon8-XML 1.0 release, and I feel that it represents a significant milestone given how far we’ve come — but there’s still a long way to go before we get to that point. I hope people will view the 1.0 version as a stable tool that’s already being used in production by at least one journal, and a strong indicator of PKP‘s commitment to developing research and software in this area.</p><p>I mentioned the Open Journal Systems integration, which is both a strategic and pragmatic move; this will be our main focus, as well as integration with OMP from its earliest inception. We also want to improve the editing aspect of Lemon8-XML — there is some great work being done in the area of using style templates for providing structural mark-up in traditional word processors; we will be working more closely with Peter Sefton’s group on the ICE project, who have a lot of experience. I’d also like to re-visit the idea of using web-based WYSIWYM editors like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.wymeditor.org/">WYMeditor</a> or an enhanced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a> as part of a user interface overhaul, and possibly integrating more closely with Google Docs if that’s an option. Certainly, there’s room for adding more citation lookup plugins: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.oaister.org/about.html">OAIster</a>, Amazon.com, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/citeseer.html">CiteSeer</a>, etc. as well as improving the existing ones. Finally, we want to try applying the approach we’ve used with citation parsing and lookup with other scholarly article elements; for example, checking quotations for correctness and plagiarism, extracting and linking author/contributor identifiers, and so on. We also have some ideas around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may06/apps/05apps.html">OpenURL</a> that may or may not come into Lemon8-XML development.</p><p>We’re also starting a major side-project based entirely around the NLM DTD in two parts: 1) building mappings from various other XML schemas to NLM; and 2) building a standard set of rendering tools for generating HTML and PDF from NLM XML, in a way that can be easily customized for an individual journal. There are already a lot of groups out there using NLM but currently the practice is quite fragmented — we’d like to see these journals and publishers become more connected and share their work as a community. As I say, we want to help increase adoption as a way to raise the bar on journal quality and improve options for publishing and archiving.</p><p>One of the most important things we’ve learned during the development of Lemon8-XML has been the value of user feedback early and often, and remaining aware of related work that’s going on, so we can remain efficient by building partnerships instead of working in parallel. We’ll continue pursuing this approach, and I’d encourage anyone who is interested in any of these areas or has ideas of their own to contribute to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091211/http://pkp.sfu.ca/contact">get in touch with us</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly two years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.crossref.org/"><strong>CrossRef</strong></a> invited a number of people to discuss unique identifiers for researchers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2007/02/crossref_author_id_meeting.html"><strong>CrossRef Author ID meeting</strong></a>). One year ago Thomson Reuters launched <strong>ResearcherID</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/01/21/thomson-scientific-launches-researcherid-to-uniquely-identify-authors"><strong>Thomson Scientific launches ResearcherID to uniquely identify authors</strong></a>). And two months ago Phil Bourne and Lynn Fink wrote about this topic in a  <strong>PLoS Computational Biology</strong> paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000247"><strong>I Am Not a Scientist, I Am a Number</strong></a>).</p><p>So it comes as no surprise that we also talked about author identifiers at the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/"><strong>ScienceOnline09</strong></a> meeting in North Carolina (both in the session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Reputation_authority_and_incentives/"><strong>Impact Factors and researcher incentives</strong></a> and over drinks afterwards). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile"><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></a> wrote down his thoughts after the meeting in a blog post (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/01/20/a-specialist-openid-service-to-provide-unique-researcher-ids/"><strong>A specialist OpenID service to provide unique researcher IDs?</strong></a>), and this resulted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://friendfeed.com/e/c1fd00ec-15f9-d894-4ea9-4ffeaac5ae28/A-specialist-OpenID-service-to-provide-unique"><strong>a very interesting</strong></a> discussion on <strong>FriendFeed</strong>. And at about the same time both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://network.nature.com/people/jandot/profile"><strong>Jan Aerts</strong></a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://saaientist.blogspot.com/2009/01/who-o-o-are-you-who-who-who-who.html"><strong>Who-o-o are you?

This week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile"><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></a> summarized the discussion in another blog post (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/02/15/contributor-ids-an-attempt-to-aggregate-and-integrate/"><strong>Contributor IDs – an attempt to aggregate and integrate</strong></a>).</p><p>Science bloggers have put a lot of thought into the idea of a unique author identifier and I’ve collected more reading material about author ID at <strong>Connotea</strong> using the tag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.connotea.org/tag/authorid"><strong>authorid</strong></a>. But I was also very curious to learn more about the work that has already been done. That’s why I asked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://network.nature.com/people/gbilder/profile"><strong>Geoffrey Bilder</strong></a> from <strong>CrossRef</strong> a few questions. In the end Geoffrey talked not only about author identifiers, but also about CrossRef, DOIs and many other aspects of scholarly publishing.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-crossref-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what CrossRef is and does?</h3><p>Let me start with what it does because this is a little less likely to make your eyes glaze-over.</p><p>CrossRef was originally founded by scholarly publishers to fight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot"><strong>link-rot</strong></a>.</p><p>Web links have a half-life of about six years. That is, after six years a link is likely to break because the content that it pointed to has been moved. To a lay-audience this might be a mere annoyance, but to scholarly and professional publishers broken links are anathema. The scholarly record is built on a foundation of links in the form of citations. If these online citation links break, the online scholarly citation record breaks.<br><br>But surely fighting link-rot should be simple, right? After all, the glory of the web is its decentralized architecture, one in which the domain name that you own can be used as a namespace for identifiers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong></a> has said that “cool URIs never die”. Aren’t “persistent URIs” merely a matter of being disciplined in the way that you mint URIs and in being conscientious about sensibly redirecting URIs when things change location on your web server?</p><p>Well, certainly the majority of broken links on the web are the result of careless web administrators not taking the time to structure and redirect their web site’s URIs properly, but there are a significant percentage of links that will break despite the best efforts of webmasters. This is because in some cases the domain name in the link will change, and in these cases the whole “domain name as URI minting name-space” starts to crumble. When otherwise sensible technorati refer to “owning” a domain name, it makes me want to stick forks in my eyeballs. We do not “own” domain names. At best, we only lease them and there are manifold ways in which we could lose control of a domain name – through litigation, through forgetfulness, through poverty, through voluntary transfer, etc. Once you don’t control a domain name anymore, then you can’t control your domain-name-based persistent identifiers either.</p><p>Incidentally, another technorati meme that makes me want to self-harm with cutlery is the notion that “persistent identifiers don’t matter in the age of the search engine. If a link breaks, we can just find the content again wherever it has moved.” This, naturally, is the self-serving argument often used by Google and it’s starry-eyed acolytes. Even just few minutes’ reflection reveals the gaping hole in this approach.</p><p>The hole is this – how do you cite a specific copy of something if there are multiple <strong>almost identical</strong> copies of it located in different places? For instance, lets say there are 2 copies (X and Y) of an article which only differ in a few paragraphs, but those few paragraphs are crucial and likely to change the reader’s interpretation of the work. How, in a world where persistent linking is maintained by search engines, do you create a citation link to article X instead of article Y? To create a search-based link that is more likely to resolve to article X, you would essentially have to encode the entire article in the search URI! Even this wouldn’t guarantee you that the link directed a future reader to article X first; it is still possible that article Y might end up getting a higher ranking because more people have linked to it and it therefore has a higher page-rank (or equivalent). Believe me, even variations of the search engine scenario (using document hashes for citations, pingbacks, etc.) quickly unravel after a little reflection.</p><p>This is all a long-winded and ranty way of saying that the issue of persistent identifiers on the web is just a wee bit more complex than most people think. So how does CrossRef address the persistent identifier issue?</p><p>From our perspective, the persistent identifier problem is much more a social problem than a technical one.</p><p>In fact, the technical part of our service is relatively straightforward. CrossRef provides a level of indirection (i.e. a pointer) between an identifier and a URL. When publishers put something online, they assign a CrossRef <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.doi.org/"><strong>Digital Object Identifier</strong></a> (DOI) to it and submit a record for that item with CrossRef. The record includes the CrossRef DOI, basic bibliographic metadata for the content and a URL that points to the current location of the content. People citing the publisher’s content are encouraged to use the CrossRef DOI for the citation instead of the publisher’s URL. When a researcher clicks on a CrossRef DOI, the CrossRef service redirects the URL to whatever URL the publisher has currently registered for that CrossRef DOI. This means that the publisher can update their CrossRef DOI record to point to a completely new URI (including a new domain name) and any CrossRef DOI citations will continue to work. We provide a few other services based on this infrastructure too. So, for instance, we can resolve an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/openurl/default.htm"><strong>OpenURL</strong></a> to a CrossRef DOI (by querying the publisher-submitted bibliographic metadata), resolve a free-text query to a CrossRef DOI and we can also return bibliographic metadata instead of redirecting if that is what the user wants.</p><p>So-far, so good, but this isn’t anything that couldn’t be accomplished using other redirection tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.purl.org/"><strong>PURLs</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.handle.net/"><strong>CNRI Handles</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xri"><strong>XRIs</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://numly.com/numly/default.asp"><strong>NUmly Numbers</strong></a>, etc.? The crucial question to ask of any such service is, “what guarantees that the publisher will actually update their URL pointers?” If the publisher doesn’t update these pointers, then the links will break anyway. It isn’t enough that a publisher decides to use PURLs, if they then don’t update their PURLs- in perpetuity.</p><p>This is where it is important to explain the organizational structure and the social effect that this has on the service.</p><p>CrossRef was founded as a non-profit, membership organization for publishers. Note that we are entirely catholic in our definition of what a publisher is, so our membership includes commercial publishers, non-profit publishers, open access publishers, institutional repositories, NGOs and IGOs, Video publishers, Wiki-based publishers, etc. We are also open to publishers of all disciplines (humanities, social sciences, sciences, professional), geographies and content types (journals, books, database records, videos, etc.)</p><p>In practice, what unites our membership is a concern that their content should be considered worthy of trust by professional researchers. One way in which researchers assess the trustworthiness of content is by determining how it sits within the scholarly record. Does it provide evidence for its assertions in citations? Do other people cite it?</p><p>When a publisher joins CrossRef, they agree to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/59pub_rules.html"><strong>set of enforceable terms and conditions</strong></a> that govern the way in which they use CrossRef’s persistent citation infrastructure. Specifically, they agree to:</p><ul><li>Register DOIs within a week of something being published online</li><li>Update the URLs associated with a DOI when said URLs change</li><li>Link citations in their content via the DOI</li></ul><p>In joining CrossRef they also agree that CrossRef can fine them or throw them out of the service if they do not meet the terms and conditions of the service. Note that the penalty of being thrown out can be quite severe as it effectively means that the publisher would become invisible in the online scholarly citation record. In short, the system has a built-in social feedback loop that strongly enforces good citizenship.</p><p>As I said, the technical infrastructure of CrossRef is pretty mundane, and it is the social aspect of the service that does the most to guarantee the persistency of CrossRef citation links.</p><h3 id="2-what-are-your-responsibilities-within-crossref">2. What are your responsibilities within CrossRef?</h3><p>Thinking of, gathering the requirements for, designing and (most importantly) launching new services.</p><p>Last year we launched a plagiarism detection service called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.crossref.org/crosscheck.html"><strong>CrossCheck</strong></a>. This year I am working on Contributor ID, another project tentatively named CrossMark and a bunch of smaller projects designed to encourage the use of DOIs in citations.</p><h3 id="3-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-for-crossref">3. What did you do before starting to work for CrossRef?</h3><p>In the early nineties Allen Renear and I co-founded Brown University’s Scholarly Technology Group, where we were charged with providing advanced consulting and support to Brown’s research community. In the mid-nineties I grew tired of the politics, resource constraints and institutional paralysis that seems to grip so many universities and I decided to do something as far away from the academic sphere as possible. In short, I worked at a management consultancy doing R&amp;D for their IT group. In 2000 I was lured into managing the web development efforts for an Information Architecture firm called Dynamic Diagrams. In 2001 we were bought by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/"><strong>Ingenta</strong></a> in the UK. I became Ingenta’s CTO and I moved to Oxford in 2002. I left Ingenta in 2005, did a brief spell of consulting for publishers in 2006 and joined CrossRef in 2007.</p><h3 id="4-what-are-your-thoughts-on-how-an-author-identifier-should-look-like">4. What are your thoughts on how an author identifier should look like? </h3><p>First of all, I think we need to stop talking about “author” identifiers. One of the first requirements we found when interviewing publishers, researchers and librarians is that we would ideally like to be able to identify any party who contributes to the scholarly literature in any way. That is, we would also like to be able to identify reviewers, editors, correspondents, bloggers, commenters, etc. This is why we have taken to calling our project the “CrossRef Contributor ID” project. This isn’t just playing with words either. For instance, as soon as you start thinking about things like “how do you accommodate reviewers” in this system you need to think of things like pseudo-anonymity. That is, you want somebody to be able to get credit for doing reviews in a way that doesn’t necessarily reveal who reviewed what. In turn, the pay-off for designing a system whereby anonymous reviewers might be credited with reviews could be profound. It might ultimately result in researchers having much more incentive to review if reviewing were something that could be counted and rated in the same way that authorship is.</p><p>Second, I think that people conflate a lot of issues when they talk about “author identifiers” [sic]. Are they talking about the simple token used (e.g. a unique string or a number assigned to an individual like a social security number), are they talking about an authentication mechanism (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://openid.net/what/"><strong>OpenID</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/"><strong>Shibboleth</strong></a>) or are they talking about the profile information associated with an identifier (e.g. publications, affiliation, contact info, etc.)? Obviously, these all overlap in some ways, but how they relate and what you choose to focus on depends largely on your use cases.</p><p>Third, speaking of use cases, our requirements gathering has identified two broad categories of use cases that, though related, have profoundly different implementation implications. One category of use cases identified revolves around “knowledge discovery” and the other category of cases revolves around “authentication.”</p><p>The “knowledge discovery” use cases are probably the most obvious things that people would like to be able to do with a contributor ID such as:</p><ul><li>Determine what IDs authored/edited/reviewed document X</li><li>What documents where authored/edited/reviewed by ID Y</li><li>What IDs are related to ID Z and what is the nature of that relationship (e.g. co-authored, edited, reviewed)</li><li>What (subject to privacy settings) is the profile information for ID Z (e.g. institutional affiliation, email address, etc.)</li><li>All the author IDs and their respective publications where the institutional affiliation recorded by the author is X</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>At this point I feel obliged to point out that the bulk of our requirements gathering has been focused on trying to understand the needs of our member publishers. The reason I mention this here is that the bulk of the “authentication” use cases that we identified are all focused around making publisher back-office systems less cumbersome. So, for instance, publishers are interested in using a “contributor id” for:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on"><strong>single sign-on</strong></a> (SSO) for manuscript tracking systems</li><li>Disambiguating contact information for use by editorial offices, royalty payments systems, copyright clearances, etc.</li><li>Automatic updating of email addresses for table of contents (TOC) alerts and other automated email communications</li><li>Automated tools for detecting potential reviewers, including tools for detecting potential conflicts of interest</li><li>Synchronization with publisher web site user profiles and granting researchers customized, privileged access to content based on profiles</li><li>Understanding all of the manifold ways in which an individual “contributes” to a publisher or a field (e.g. As an editor, reviewer, letter writer, conference chair, etc.).</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>As I said, these are very publisher-focused use cases, but this is not to say that we are not interested in the use cases posed by librarians, researchers and funding agencies. We have actively been talking to people from each of these constituencies and we are trying to understand if there are ways in which we can help them. For instance, we have recently been speaking to a group of researchers who are interested in using some sort of authenticated contributor ID as a mechanism for controlling who gets trusted access to sensitive genome-wide aggregate genotype data.</p><p>The interesting thing to note about these “authentication” use cases is that they have far more stringent requirements than the “knowledge discovery” use cases. In other words if you are only trying to address the knowledge discovery problem, it might be fine to use automated techniques to disambiguate authors and assign IDs to them. State-of-the-art mechanisms for automatic disambiguation of authors from a defined corpus can be 96-97% accurate, which sounds pretty good. At least until you realize that CrossRef has ~200K new article DOIs deposited each month, each of which on average has about 3 authors. This could potentially leave you with upwards of 20K in mis/un-identified authors. This error rate might be an acceptable tradeoff for knowledge discovery type applications, but it certainly isn’t suitable for authentication type applications.</p><p>Speaking of authentication, I think the fourth thing to note is that, though I think <strong>OpenID</strong> will probably play an important role in any service we provide, by itself it makes a pretty bad identity token and would provide little utility on its own. This all gets back to some of the issues that I raised above when discussing persistent identifiers: URI-based identifiers are fragile because they depend on the domain name. What happens if your OpenID is tied to a domain that you don’t control (e.g. a company, an institution a country)? How can you guarantee that, should you leave that company/institution/country that they will do the right thing and let you maintain or redirect that identifying credential?</p><p>The traditional geeky response to this scenario is “don’t get yourself into that situation. Only tie your <strong>OpenID </strong>to a domain that you own.” (Insert forks in eyeballs). Again, you do not “own” a domain name. You lease it. What happens if you lose control of it due to litigation, forgetfulness, poverty, divorce, death? Death? Yes, what happens when somebody dies? When I die does the not-yet-born Georgia Bilder get to buy “my” domain “gbilder.com” and make it the basis of her identity? Mmm… Gets kind of complicated doesn’t it?</p><p>Of course, lots of the same issues can be raised with CrossRef, right? What guarantees that CrossRef won’t become evil and co-opt all of our identities? This, of course is the big fear underlining the knee-jerk reaction against “centralized systems” in favor of “distributed systems”. The problem with this, as I mentioned in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/https://friendfeed.com/e/c1fd00ec-15f9-d894-4ea9-4ffeaac5ae28/A-specialist-OpenID-service-to-provide-unique/"><strong>FriendFeed thread</strong></a> is that my personal and unfashionable observation is that “distributed” begets “centralized.” For every distributed service created, we’ve then had to create a centralized service to make it useable again (ICANN, Google, Pirate Bay, CrossRef, DOAJ, ticTocs, WorldCat, etc.). This gets us back to square one and makes me think the real issue is- how do you make the centralized system that eventually emerges accountable? This is, of course, a social issue more than a technical issue and involves making sure that whatever entity emerges has clearly defined data portability policies and a “living will” that attempts to guarantee that the service can be run in perpetuity- even if by another organization. For the record, I don’t think adopting the slogan “don’t be evil” is enough ;).</p><p>Anyway- I could go on talking about what the contributor ID “should look like” for a very, very long time, but I think that the above probably addresses some of the major points that are raised when the topic is discussed.</p><h3 id="5-what-are-the-benefits-and-maybe-disadvantages-if-crossref-manages-the-author-identifier">5. What are the benefits (and maybe disadvantages) if CrossRef manages the author identifier?</h3><p>I think the biggest potential disadvantage that CrossRef has is that it is a consensus-based organization that is governed by sometimes fierce competitors. This aspect of the organization can sometimes slow things down. On the other hand, this can also be a huge strength for us. Once a consensus is agreed, we can move very quickly and push uptake across the industry.</p><p>Research increasingly transcends institutional, geographic and discipline boundaries, so I think another advantage that we have is that we are well positioned to provide a service that is similarly unconstrained.</p><p>Finally, I think that we have a very interesting advantage by virtue of the fact that our infrastructure is already integrated upstream in the publication process. There is a useful property of the system that we are designing in that, as researchers used the CrossRef identifier in their interactions with publishers and this data is fed back into our system via DOI deposits, you could start to develop a trust-metric based on the types of claims attached to an author’s profile. For instance, an author profile that consisted of nothing but self-claims (e.g. I claim I wrote paper X) might not be very worthy of trust whereas an author profile that consisted of publications that had been verified by the publisher (by virtue of those publications having been processed along with the CrossRef contributor ID) would have far more credibility. You can start to see an interesting hierarchy of publication claims emerging such as:</p><ul><li>Proxy claims (Leigh claims Geoffrey wrote article X)</li><li>Self Claims (Geoffrey claims Geoffrey wrote article X)</li><li>Verified claims (Geoffrey claims Geoffrey wrote article X <strong>and</strong> the “Journal of Psychoceramics” confirms this claim)</li><li>Verified Proxy Claims (Geoffrey (who has already been verified as an author of article X) claims that Kirsty was also an author of article X)</li></ul><h3 id="6-how-does-your-author-identifier-relate-to-other-identifiers-e-g-researcherid-scopus-author-idor-openid">6. How does your author identifier relate to other identifiers, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://help.scopus.com/robo/projects/schelp/h_autsrch_intro.htm">Scopus Author ID</a>or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://openid.net/what/">OpenID</a>?</h3><p>OpenID is a different kettle of fish, and I discussed it already above. As for the others (I’d add <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.authorresolver.com/"><strong>Author Resolver</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://repec.org/"><strong>RePEC</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.scilink.com/start.action"><strong>SciLink</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://bibserver.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/mathweb/index.py"><strong>MathPeople</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://network.nature.com/"><strong>Nature Network</strong></a>, etc.), we’ve actually been talking to some of these parties in order to understand how they might relate to a CrossRef Contributor ID. One obvious difference is in the use-cases being addressed. All of the above are focused on “knowledge discovery” use-cases. None of them pretends to provide any sort of authentication services. It is also interesting to note that in a lot of the above cases, the parties see their author identification functionality as a means to an end. For instance, their primary application is “creating better metrics” or “running a social network” or “expert identification” for recruiting purposes. In these cases they don’t necessarily see a CrossRef system as being competitive and, in fact, they think that such a service might even improve their primary application.</p><h3 id="7-can-you-talk-about-the-current-status-and-next-planned-steps-of-the-contributorid-project">7. Can you talk about the current status and next planned steps of the ContributorID project?</h3><p>We just ended lengthy period of investigation and requirements gathering. In the process we went down a few blind alleys. Now we are working on a prototype that we will test with a few publishers. It is hard to say how long this will take as we are just in the process of planning this phase.</p><h3 id="8-satisfying-many-different-interests-is-one-of-the-biggest-challenges-in-creating-an-author-identifier-what-are-the-lessons-learned-from-implementing-the-digital-object-identifier-doi-">8. Satisfying many different interests is one of the biggest challenges in creating an author identifier. What are the lessons learned from implementing the digital object identifier (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090221213233/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>)?</h3><p>I’ll give you one tactical lesson and one strategic lesson.</p><p>The tactical lesson is foremost in my mind because I have recently been trying to build tools to encourage researchers to use DOIs in their citations. The problem arrises when a researcher occasionally encounters a DOI that is 80 characters long. There is just no way that a researcher is going to insert <strong>that</strong> in a citation. The tactical lesson here is that it is sometimes better to make an identifier opaque and short. This is also a tremendously unfashionable position to take, but I think that one of Clay Shirky’s observations about hierarchical categorization systems also applies to identifiers. If you make the identifier human-interpretable and add semantics, then people will be extremely tempted to start hard-coding ontologies into their identifiers. This makes said identifiers both long and inherently brittle. The ontologies will inevitably evolve, and then people will want to change the identifiers- at which point they will either break or you have a giant identifier mapping subsystem to create.</p><p>We see a manifestation of this syndrome already with the DOI. Each DOI has a four-digit “prefix” which is effectively a namespace for the assigning publisher. Note that I said the “assigning” publisher- this is not necessarily the publisher who currently “owns” the DOI with that prefix. What this often means is that, when publisher A acquires publisher B, publisher A will ask CrossRef if we can create new DOIs for all of publisher B’s backfiles so that they all have the same prefix! The answer to their request is “no”, but you wouldn’t believe how stroppy publishers can get about this. They somehow imbue this ridiculous four-digit prefix with branding significance. This, of course, is absolutely mental, but it is a predictable form of mental. The French went mad when they had to replace their region-encoded license plates with opaque EU ones. People in the US go mad when they are given new area codes. In short, when people associate semantic significance in identifiers, you will face problems.</p><p>The strategic lesson is basically a recapitulation of the "technical vs “social” theme I’ve been banging on about. I think that, at first, even our membership thought of the CrossRef DOI as being a technical solution to a problem, not a social one. It has become much clearer to us over the years that CrossRef DOIs are only as persistent as CrossRef staff. That is, we sometimes have to bang on lots of heads and threaten members with fines and worse in order to make sure that they are meeting their terms &amp; conditions. The good news is that CrossRef has become essential infrastructure for a wide variety of publishers who are often at each other’s throats in any other circumstances. In many ways these “different interests” are our strength. Everybody wants it to work better, nobody wants to see it die and nobody wants it to be co-opted. We are working hard to put the social structures into place that will guarantee its longevity. Part of this is making sure that we are fiscally sound (which we are) and part of this is making sure that, even if we do disappear, other stakeholders can run the system if need be.</p><h3 id="9-what-can-researchers-interested-in-author-identifiers-do-to-help">9. What can researchers interested in author identifiers do to help?</h3><ul><li>Feed CrossRef more use cases.</li><li>Let CrossRef know what you think will/won’t work.</li><li>Make sure you let your publishers know if you think this is a good idea. Naturally, I expect you will also let them know if you think it is a bad idea ;-)</li></ul><p>I can be reached at <strong>gbilder at crossref dot org</strong>.</p>]]></content>

One well-known example is hereditary colon cancer. Patients with mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes <em><em>MLH1</em></em> or <em><em>MSH2</em></em> develop colon cancer because of an increased rate of mutations. And tumors in patients with familial polyposis coli have a growth advantage because of a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene APC. Mutations and selection also help to explain the process of metastasis, the formation of secondary tumor foci at distant sites in the body. Understanding metastasis is important, because it is often this spread of the tumor that makes a previously localized cancer an incurable disease.</p><p>In 1977 a landmark paper in <em><em>Science</em></em> by Isaiah Fidler and Margaret Kripke (Fidler 1977) described a mouse model of lung metastasis using the syngeneic B16 mouse melanoma cell line. This melanoma cell line originated spontaneously in a C57BL/6 mouse in 1954 and is known to metastasize to the lung. They produced several clones of the B16 cells, each clone originating from a single cell and therefore genetically identical. Cells from these clones were then injected into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice. The number of lung metastases in these mice varied dramatically between clones and was also different from the parental cell line. Fidler and Kripke concluded that a subpopulation of highly metastatic cells preexists in the parent population and is selected during the metastatic process.</p><p>In 1994 I started to work on a research project that tried to identify molecules responsible for the selection process in this B16 lung metastasis model. This was before microarrays and the sequencing of the mouse genome, and we used a technique called differential display to identify differentially expressed genes in two variant B16 cell lines that created low and high numbers of lung metastases. We identified a novel gene that turned out to be a transcriptional regulator (Shioda 1996) but probably is not that critical for the metastatic process.</p><p>In 2009 we have learned a lot more about the metastatic process, but we still know much more about genes involved in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, etc. than the genes critical for the metastatic process. And we still have not come up with a clever way to specifically treat that malignant subpopulation of tumor cells that will later produce metastatic disease.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Fidler, I., &amp; Kripke, M.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One interesting session at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://scienceonline09.com/">ScienceOnline09</a> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Social_networking_for_scientists/">Social networking for scientists</a>, moderated by Cameron Neylon and Deepak Singh. We now have so many of these social networking sites, that it becomes difficult to differentiate between them and to see how they can interact with each other. One important category is social bookmarking sites for scientists. I spoke with Kevin Emamy from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a> to find out more.</p><p><em><em>Most of the CiteULike team. Kevin is the second person from the right.</em></em></p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-citeulike-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what CiteULike is and does?</h3><p>CiteULike is social bookmarking for research papers. It enables you to easily store references online, share them in groups and discover new ones.</p><p>It's run as a web service, so everything is always stored online. You can access it from any computer (most of us use more than one these days) and if you're lazy and stupid like me you're much less likely to lose anything. Sharing and discovery obviously work better this way too.</p><p>The social side of it is simply that by default everyones posts are public and you can see who has bookmarked the same papers as you, what tags they are giving them and from there you can go on to browse what else they are bookmarking.</p><p>And then we have groups which are shared libraries of posts, newsfeeds for every user action, RSS feeds, watchlists, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://www.citeulike.org/citegeist">CiteGeist</a> (which is a hotlist of posts) and obviously search as ways to encourage this social discovery.</p><h3 id="2-do-your-users-basically-just-store-their-own-bookmarks-or-do-you-also-see-a-lot-of-use-of-the-social-networking-features">2. Do your users basically just store their own bookmarks or do you also see a lot of use of the social networking features?</h3><p>In the 30 days up to the Christmas Holidays 08, CiteULike received 116,477 posts and 6,189 of those were copies made directly from other user's librarys, which is the successful end result of the social stuff. That doesn't count people who find an article, go to the original source to read it, and then post it.</p><p>The other social stuff is hard to quantify without diving into the weblogs. Also, once you get into the realms of counting pageviews and linkouts etc. it becomes easy to mislead yourself about what is really going on, which is why we use “posts” as a genuine metric (assuming you are on top of the spam).</p><p>But the social discovery stuff is certainly used. Groups for example; well over 50% are active, by which I mean people have posted to them in the last 90 days. Watchlists (following another user's posts) and RSS are very active. Many people search the site, either directly or through RSS feeds.</p><p>One thing that is definitely true is that many more people browse the site than actually register and post, by a factor of say 5:1, and I'm discounting the random Google traffic that just bounces on and off.</p><p>Of course, the service would never have got off the ground if it didn't provide individual value to a user without any social features, so yes, many people use it just like that and always will.</p><h3 id="3-how-is-citeulike-different-from-other-social-bookmarking-tools-e-g-connotea-2collab-or-delicious">3. How is CiteULike different from other social bookmarking tools, e.g. Connotea, 2collab or delicious?</h3><p>It differs from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://delicious.com/">delicious</a> because we extract and bookmark citation metadata along with the URL, so it's aimed at professional researchers and scientists. We have over 50 sites where we do this, covering most of the online sources of journal papers. Because of this specialization our userbase is very different and therefore much more relevant when you look at the community features. The tags, as one example, are very specialized.</p><p>There are lots of differences in detail with the other two 'scholarly' services but it seems that the users have voted with their feet (or should I say mice); CiteULike is far and away the most popular service. If you count the number of papers posted we estimate that CiteULike is currently 3-5 times the size of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a> both in total posts and posts on a daily basis (2 million+ posts and very little spam for CiteULike vs. 650k posts including a significant proportion of spam for connotea, 3k-5k daily posts for CiteULike vs. 1k to 1.5k claimed for Connotea).</p><h3 id="4-does-citeulike-integrate-with-other-social-networking-sites-and-services-for-scientists-e-g-connotea-mendeley-or-friendfeed-does-it-integrate-with-desktop-reference-managers">4. Does CiteULike integrate with other social networking sites and services for scientists, e.g. Connotea, Mendeley or FriendFeed? Does it integrate with desktop reference managers?</h3><p>You can export and import files to and from pretty much all these services.</p><p>In the case of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> I have seen many people using RSS feeds to display their CiteULike posts there, which is great, it's a really good service.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> are based in London like us and we have begun to discuss ways where we can integrate more tightly, the point being to make the workflow better for users of both services.</p><h3 id="5-what-is-your-policy-regarding-personal-pdf-files-uploaded-to-citeulike">5. What is your policy regarding personal PDF files uploaded to CiteULike?</h3><p>Only the person who uploaded a PDF can download it, so CiteULike is acting as an online storage drive.</p><p>We have also allowed uploads to “private groups” which are invite only and otherwise invisible. In this case the user will commit that they have a right to distribute the document to the people in the group,<br>who they already know.</p><h3 id="6-what-are-your-responsibilities-within-citeulike">6. What are your responsibilities within CiteULike?</h3><p>There are only five of us, so we don't really have roles. Unlike the rest of the team, I can't write code or design applications, so I have to leave that to my esteemed colleagues.</p><p>One of the things I try and do is to promote CiteULike and increase our userbase and traffic, which is a bit of a capricious art, but one way that has worked for us is to try to engage with, dare I say it,<br>the publishers.</p><p>Springer, who we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://www.springer.com/company/citeulike?SGWID=0-164102-0-0-0">recently agreed a sponsorship with</a>, have been invaluable to us in this regard. They are one of the few major publishers who are really progressive and actually understand this stuff.</p><h3 id="7-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-for-citeulike">7. What did you do before starting to work for CiteULike?</h3><p>We all worked in the software industry, sometimes together. Richard wrote CiteULike as a tool for his own use when he was back doing research at university.</p><h3 id="8-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-citeulike">8. Do you want to talk about future plans for CiteULike?</h3><p>Well the team are continuously improving the service, making it perform better, fixing things that break etc. I wish I could count the number of improvements that have been made over the last 18 months. That is part of the secret to it's growth, the users can tell when the developers are making an effort. We have a very active newsgroup where users make feature and functionality requests or report problems. I have regularly seen my colleagues put stuff live in a matter of hours following a user request, which is one of the advantages of a service that is run by it's developers.</p><p>We have wanted to do some kind of recommendation system for a long time; automated collaborative filtering or whatever. We certainly have the data to do it. But it is, I'm told, a hard problem if you want to get useful results. It's possible we'll work with someone else on this.</p><p>It was really interesting to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174120/http://www.plos.org/">PLoS</a> announcing the variety of impact metrics they want to publish about their articles, a small part of which is going to be social bookmarking posts. We are currently giving them this data on request, it would be nice to allow anyone to get this sort of data out of CiteULike themselves (we do already make the whole CiteULike dataset freely available for download).</p><p>Another example of that is that a lot of other sites want to display CiteULike tag data along with the relevant articles; there are 6.7 million user created tags on CiteULike now (that's total not distinct)<br>and those tags have been given by people who know the subjects. I suppose I am talking about some kind of API, which would also allow reference managers etc. to integrate with CiteULike more easily, as you asked about above.</p><p>Having said that, there is a great temptation to continually add more features or try to make it into something different to what it really is and I'm not sure if that is the right approach (though we have been guilty of it).</p><p>For example, one of the biggest issues we have is that CiteULike is good at matching articles that have been posted by hand but not articles imported by file upload. By “match” I mean identify that two articles from different sources are in fact the same, which is the basis of the social stuff; seeing who is reading what you're reading etc. Seeing as 40% or so of our posts come via file upload, it would be great to fix. Matching is done by DOI and PMID; however we ran some tests that showed only 5% of file uploaded articles contain these, so maybe we'll try a different approach.</p><p>So what we try to focus on is to make it better and more efficient at what it does well: social bookmarking for research papers. There is plenty of work to do in that regard.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://scienceonline09.com/">ScienceOnline09</a> meeting last weekend not only had a number of interesting presentations and discussions, but even more importantly, was a great opportunity to personally interact with a great number of people that share your ideas and interests. It was the first time I personally met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://network.nature.com/people/U06343707/profile">Moshe Pritsker</a>, the CEO, Editor-in-Chief and co-founder of the Journal of Visualized Experiments (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://www.jove.com/">JoVE</a>), <em><em>a peer-reviewed, free access, online journal devoted to the publication of biological research in a video format</em></em> (taken from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://www.jove.com/index.stt">About JoVE</a>). As I like to write about new technologies that help scientists publish their research, I asked Moshe a few questions after the meeting.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-jove-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what JoVE is and does?</h3><p><em><em>JoVE</em></em> is the first video journal for biological and biomedical research. We publish articles that include step-by-step video demonstrations of experimental techniques and procedures. For example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://www.jove.com/index/details.stp?ID=923">A Behavioral Assay to Measure Responsiveness of Zebrafish to Changes in Light Intensities</a> by the group of John Dowling at Harvard or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://www.jove.com/index/details.stp?ID=1067">Calcium Imaging of Cortical Neurons using Fura-2 AM</a> by the group of Ricardo Dolmetsch at Stanford. We call these articles video-articles or video-protocols. They also include a text part which is similar to traditional scientific articles (abstract, introduction, experiment, materials and references).</p><p>This novel video-based approach to scientific publishing is applied to increase reproducibility and transparency of experimental studies, which is the <em><em>bottleneck</em></em> problem in the life sciences today. As every bench scientist knows, it is very difficult to repeat biological experiments based on their text description in traditional scientific journals. This is because the text format presents a requirement for scientists to understand the complex reality and numerous <em><em>small</em></em> details of the experiment from reading. It is very difficult. Visualization through video provides a solution to this problem by clear unambiguous demonstration of experimental techniques and procedures. Using this new approach will enable increase efficiency and productivity across all the areas of biological research and drug discovery.</p><p>Being a scientific journal, <em><em>JoVE</em></em> is indexed in PubMed and MEDLINE, and has an editorial board of 22 distinguished professors from Harvard, Princeton, NIH and other leading institutions in US, Europe and Japan. After two years, since its foundation in October 2006, <em><em>JoVE</em></em> has published nearly 300 articles across all the areas of experimental biology including neuroscience, cell biology, developmental biology, stem cell research, immunology, bioengineering and plant biology. Most of the articles are produced at the laboratories in the leading academic research institutions including Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, UCSF, Yale and others.</p><h3 id="2-what-kind-of-research-is-well-suited-to-be-published-in-jove-and-what-kind-of-research-doesn-t-work-well">2. What kind of research is well-suited to be published in JOVE? And what kind of research doesn't work well?</h3><p>The <em><em>JoVE</em></em> video-based format of publication is very effective for description of experimental techniques in all the areas of biological and clinical research. We have accumulated a lot of experience in production and publication of video-articles in these areas. This format can be also applied for experiments in chemistry and physics. For example, we have recently published a video-article on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://www.jove.com/index/details.stp?ID=942">creation of chemical libraries using Ugi reaction</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://network.nature.com/people/jcbradley/profile&amp;#39;s">Jean-Claude Bradley</a> group at Drexel University.</p><p>We have less experience with video-publication on theoretical and computational research, e.g. bioinformatics. We currently explore developing different formats for these non-experimental areas of science.</p><h3 id="3-how-do-you-help-authors-with-video-production">3. How do you help authors with video production?</h3><p>We know that most scientists do not have experience in video-production, and therefore cannot make good quality videos on their own experiments. Therefore, we take complete responsibility for this part. Specifically, we send video-professionals to film at the laboratories that want to publish their experiments in <em><em>JoVE</em></em>.</p><p>The entire <em><em>JoVE</em></em> publication process works as following:</p><ul><li>authors submits a text description (protocol) of their experiment to <em><em>JoVE</em></em></li><li><em><em>JoVE</em></em> sends one of its video-professionals to film the experiment in the authorsâ€™ laboratory</li><li><em><em>JoVE</em></em> editors edit the video</li><li>the video is submitted to the approval by authors and reviewers</li></ul><p>To facilitate integration of video into scientific publishing, <em><em>JoVE</em></em> has developed a network of video-professionals to conduct production of scientific videos in research labs across 30 cities in USA, Canada, UK, Germany and Japan including such centers of academic research as Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver, London, Berlin and others. These video-professionals are selected, interviewed and trained by <em><em>JoVE</em></em> before they are sent to film in the laboratories. This infrastructure enables production and publication of video-articles from university laboratories around the world.</p><h3 id="4-can-you-talk-a-little-bit-about-the-peer-review-process">4. Can you talk a little bit about the peer review process?</h3><p>The video-articles are sent to reviewers in a regular fashion: 2-3 anonymous reviewers at different universities. The reviewers provide their comments according to the timeline in videos, e.g. "introduce changes at 2 minutes 35 seconds". They also provide comments on the text part, e.g. "introduce changes in paragraph 4".</p><p>We are more interested in the applicability and technical clarity rather than novelty of the methods published. To achieve our goal, to increase transparency and efficiency in biological research, we need to visualize all the experimental techniques applied today. It is less important whether they are <em><em>old</em></em> or <em><em>new</em></em>. For example, purification and transplantation of hematopoetic stem cells are used for more than 40 years. Yet, it is very difficult, even impossible, to learn these techniques based on text descriptions. So, it should be published on video.</p><h3 id="5-what-are-your-responsibilities-within-jove">5. What are your responsibilities within JoVE?</h3><p>As every CEO of a start-up, I wear multiple hats. I oversee and coordinate the work of different parts of <em><em>JoVE</em></em> including editorial, publishing, IT, video-production, business development, marketing and sales. My personal responsibilities as Editor-in-Chief include management of the editorial and publishing processes, marketing in academia and publishing industry, and PR.</p><p>I consider myself <em><em>EXTREMELY</em></em> lucky to meet very smart and hard-working people working with me on <em><em>JoVE</em></em>, including my two partners and <em><em>JoVE</em></em> co-founders, Nikita Bernstein and Klaus Korak (M.D.). Among others are Aaron Kolski-Andreaco (Ph.D.), Nandita Singh (Ph.D.), Mark Shalinsky (Ph.D.), Alvin Liang and Lori Chesla. A large fraction of doctorate-holders in the team enables us to adapt our innovative product to the high demands of the scientific community.</p><h3 id="6-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-for-jove">6. What did you do before starting to work for JoVE?</h3><p>I was doing my Ph.D. in Molecular Biology at Princeton, working on embryonic stem cells and bioinformatics. This is where the <em><em>JoVE</em></em> idea was born since I, like any other scientists around, was suffering from low reproducibility of experiments. Then I was working as a post-doc at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, for one year. Then I met my partners, Nikita Bernstein and Klaus Korak, and <em><em>JoVE</em></em> was started.</p><h3 id="7-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-jove">7. Do you want to talk about future plans for JoVE?</h3><p>My dream is to build a large comprehensive online video-library that will include a video-protocol for every possible experimental technique in biological and medical research. This will tremendously increase productivity of research in academia and biotech industry, accelerating development of new technologies and drug discovery. This will also have a strong impact on scientific education and science policy at all levels.</p><p>Being initially focused on basic biological research, we received numerous requests to expand our approach into clinical medicine, psychology and other fields. We are doing our first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://www.jove.com/index/details.stp?ID=992">steps</a> in these directions too.</p><p><em><em>Further Reading</em></em></p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://jove-blog.blogspot.com/">Official JoVE blog</a> with posts from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/profile">Anna Kushnir</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/blog/2008/01/07/blogging-can-help-you-get-a-job-continued">Blogging Can Help You Get a Job, Continued</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://network.nature.com/people/steelgraham/profile">Graham Steel</a>.</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053056/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/02/visualize_this_interview_with.php">Visualize This!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Sunday I will moderate a session called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Public_health_and_medical_information/">Providing public health and medical information to all</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki">ScienceOnline09</a>. I didn't pick the title, but it is a topic I care a lot about. Because the session is intended as an open discussion, I thought that a blog post would be good way to organize my thoughts and ideas that I have for this session<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/01/16/scienceonline09_providing_public_health_and_medical_information_to_all/#fn1">1</a></sup>. And even though there are only two days left, I might even get some valuable feedback.</p><p>We science bloggers have many recurring themes, and this session is again about access to information and filtering out the important information.</p><h3 id="access">Access</h3><p>The traditional format to provide important medical information is the peer-reviewed journal article. Unless you work at a large research institution or university hospital, only part of these papers will be available as full-text articles. Notable examples of journals with immediate open access to peer reviewed research are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.bmj.com/channels/research.dtl">British Medical Journal</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://medicine.plosjournals.org/">PLoS Medicine</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed/">BMC Medicine</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.openmedicine.ca/">Open Medicine</a>. Many other medical journals provide free fulltext access 6-12 months after publication, and this is now a requirement for research funded by many funding agencies, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">NIH</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/Policy/index.htm">Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.hhmi.org/about/research/journals/main?action=search">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>.</p><p>Clinical trials are essential to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of many medical conditions. Since 2005 all clinical trials have to registered in one of several central databases (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</a>) before the first patient is treated. The information in these publicly accessible databases includes the trial design and participating centers. Since September 2008, clinicaltrials.gov started to also report key results, as required by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">Federal Drug Administration Amendment Act</a>. It is important to remember that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/01/10/what-science-is-worth-shouting-about">not all clinical trials eventually will be published</a>, so that looking just at the published literature will not give a complete picture.</p><h3 id="filtering">Filtering</h3><p>Access to important medical information is only the first step. The filtering of this information is at least as important. With filtering I mean both finding the important research papers and evaluating them in a larger context. A meta-analysis is a systematic review that follows a standard set of rules for finding and evaluating research papers, a format championed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Collaboration</a>. A meta-analysis can not only summarize published research papers, but sometimes also uses the raw data of the published research (the so-called individual patient data meta-analysis). I would wish that the meta-analysis receives the same kind of attention in the blogosphere as the open access to research papers.</p><p>Whereas a positive outcome in a good meta-analysis is the best evidence for the usefulness of a healthcare intervention, most filtering of biomedical research papers comes to us in different ways:</p><ul><li>Review articles</li><li>Journal editorials</li><li>Science blogging</li><li>Articles by science journalists</li><li> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/12/05/open-access-is-not-enough-the-source-is-also-important">Direct to consumer advertising</a> (United States and New Zealand only)</li><li>Social networking sites such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a></li></ul><p>I would argue that science articles in traditional media (e.g. newspapers) and direct to consumer advertising may work in drawing your attention to a research paper, but they are usually useless in evaluating biomedical research. And obviously I believe that science blogging has great potential to help in both the finding and evaluation of important biomedical research. Meta-analyses take a very long time and review articles take a long time. A thoughtful blog post on a recently published paper can provide an important service. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://researchblogging.org/">Research Blogging</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature Blogs</a> are two services to help find these blog posts. Social networking sites for scientists are a great tool to find interesting research papers, but I don't know how they can help evaluate a research paper. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.f1000medicine.com/">Faculty of 1000 Medicine</a> is a very interesting approach to the filtering problem, but I haven't used the service enough to comment on it here.</p><p><em><em>Addendum (01/18/09)</em></em><br>It can be a good thing to have your presentation on the second day of a conference. You come up with new ideas. I changed the title to better convey what I would like to talk about in this session: <em><em>Reporting medical research:</em></em> <em><em>specific problems and specific solutions</em></em>. And I've added another topic besides access and filtering:</p><h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3><p>There are many reasons why people are interested in reporting or learning about medical research. But betroffenheit and financial interests are two very strong reasons that should always be kept in mind. Betroffenheit is a German word that means something that is directly affecting your life. If you are a patient with a serious medical condition, or have a sick friend or relative, you obviously have very different needs than someone who just wants to catch up on the latest research on the release of calcium from intracellular stores. Betroffenheit is not confined to medical research, climate change is another example.<br>Obviously there are often important financial interests behind the outcome of medical research. And this not only means the interests of drug companies or device manufacturers. Most presentations of medical research in larger meetings now begin with a financial disclosure slide.</p><p>I've updated the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.slideshare.net/mfenner/providing-public-health-and-medical-information-to-all-presentation-924116">Slideshare Presentation</a> that I want to give as an introduction to the session. And the conference Wiki page for the session is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022812/http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Public_health_and_medical_information/">here</a>.</p><p>fn1. Yet another argument for the usefulness of science blogging.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2009-01-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I wrote about the different ways results of a clinical trial can be reported (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/23/what-are-the-right-numbers-for-jupiter">What are the right numbers for JUPITER</a>). Inspired by blog posts by <em><em>Eva Amsen</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog/2008/12/29/failure">Failure</a>) and <em><em>Sally Church</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://www.pharmastrategyblog.com/2009/01/over-hyped-cancer-drugs-or-sensational-journalism.html">Over hyped cancer drugs or sensational journalism?</a>), I thought more about what makes scientific findings worth talking about outside of your immediate research community. I will look at cancer research, and it is obvious that some research findings are more exciting than others. But it less obvious that it is as important who is communicating the research and what is the intended audience. This is especially true for translational research<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/01/10/what_science_is_worth_shouting_about/#fn1"> </a></sup>(Translational Research 2008), where research findings can change the way we treat patients and drug companies (and others) can potentially earn a lot of money.</p><h3 id="the-academic-researcher">The academic researcher</h3><p>Academic researchers involved in basic or clinical cancer research are interested in publications and grant money. As Eva <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog/2008/12/29/failure">said</a>: the unit of success is the publication record. Basic cancer research can be very exciting and touches many related fields from signal transduction to epigenetics. But what confuses me is when basic research findings are related to the treatment of human cancer, which is a completely different story. Cell lines are not living organisms, mice are not men and very few basic research findings make it into a clinical trial.<br>Unfortunately less than one in five studies in cancer (they all have to be registered with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</a> since 2005) have been published in peer-reviewed journals (Ramsey 2008). Negative results will usually not be published, and this so-called publication bias creates many problems. Just imagine 5 clinical trials with a new drug where one trial will show an advantage for the new treatment. This trial will be published in a nice journal, probably one negative trial will be published in a small journal and the remaining 3 trials will remain unpublished. Just looking at the published literature will of course give the wrong impression, but these are the only data that are available to most people.</p><h3 id="the-drug-company">The drug company</h3><p>A drug company is interested in marketing approval of a drug. This approval is obtained from the <em><em>Food and Drug Administration</em></em> (FDA) in the United States and from the <em><em>European Medicines Agency</em></em> EMEA for most of Europe. Approval of a cancer drug usually requires one or more large randomized trials (so-called phase III trials) that shows that the drug improves survival. And up to 50% of these phase III trials fail to show the desired effect, even when earlier (so-called phase II) trials were positive<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/01/10/what_science_is_worth_shouting_about/#fn3"> </a></sup>(Chan 2008). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://www.gpc-biotech.com/en/anticancer_programs/satraplatin/clinical_trials/index.html">Satraplatin</a> is one recent example of a drug that showed promising results in the treatment of prostate cancer but failed to prolong survival – and therefore was not approved by the FDA.</p><h3 id="the-insurance-company-or-whoever-pays-for-medical-care-">The insurance company (or whoever pays for medical care)</h3><p>The drug erlotinib was approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but the median benefit in overall survival was less than 2 weeks<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/01/10/what_science_is_worth_shouting_about/#fn4"> </a></sup>(Moore 2007). Insurance companies are interested in treatments that are not only effective, but also cost-effective. For cancer treatments one can calculate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Adding erlotinib to gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer would cost about $410,000 per year of life saved<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/01/10/what_science_is_worth_shouting_about/#fn5"> </a></sup>(Miksad 2007). Costs over $100.000 per year of life saved are considered high and the high cost is the reason that the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) decided to not recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/579628">4 new drugs for the treatment of renal cancer</a> in August 2008. NICE doesn't question the effectiveness of these drugs, but wants these drugs to become cheaper.</p><h3 id="the-media">The media</h3><p>Cancer research sells. Cancer is very common and many people can tell sad stories of friends or relatives that died because of cancer. And we want to hear encouraging stories. But the media often confuse promising findings in basic research or early clinical trials with a new cure for cancer. One of the more famous examples is the statement <em><em>Judah is going to cure cancer in two years</em></em> by James Watson in a 1998 <em><em>New York Times</em></em> story on angiogenesis research (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E6D6113EF930A35756C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">A Cautious Awe Greets Drugs That Eradicate Tumors in Mice</a>). Another example is this recent article (cited by <em><em>Sally Church</em></em> in her blog post mentioned above) in the <em><em>Times</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/men/article4375429.ece">Cancer drug could save the lives of 10,000 a year</a>). <em><em>Ben Goldacre</em></em> has written more than one critical blog post about how traditional media report cancer research (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/19/cancer.foodtech">Still no cure for cancer hysteria</a>).</p><h3 id="the-patient">The patient</h3><p>A patient with cancer needs a drug treatment that either cures his cancer or prolongs survival. The new treatment should either be better or have fewer side effects than the current standard of care. But many cancer patients can't wait until a new cancer drug is approved and available for prescription. So whenever possible, patients should participate in a clinical trial. Clinical trial participation by adult cancer patients is unfortunately low (less than 5% compared to more than 50% for children with cancer<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003033024/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/01/10/what_science_is_worth_shouting_about/#fn6"> </a></sup>(Sateren 2002)), but this is the best way to receive a promising new drug as early as possible (and to stop receiving it when the drug has been shown to be ineffective or toxic).</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>We should be careful how we report research findings outside of specialist journals or research meetings, especially if these findings could have important consequences outside our immediate research community.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The end of the year is always a time to think about the past and the future. Even more so if you also have your birthday (FemaleScienceProfessor calls it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://science-professor.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-time-birthdays.html">Christmas Time Birthdays</a>). Below are some of my plans for the next year. The general theme: more overlap of science blogging with my daytime job as physician treating cancer patients and doing cancer research.</p><h3 id="meet-fellow-science-bloggers">Meet fellow science bloggers</h3><p>I'm looking forward to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://www.scienceonline09.com/">ScienceOnline'09</a> in January. Please contact me by email if you have an interesting idea for the session Providing public health and medical information to all. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://www.chiswick.demon.co.uk/CISB09.html">Cromer is so Bracing</a> in February will be very different, maybe something like conversations at the fireplace? And I hope we repeat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html">Science Blogging 2008: London</a>.</p><h3 id="start-a-new-job">Start a new job</h3><p>If everything works out as expected, I will start a new job next year. It will still be at my institution and will in fact be very similar, but will present new challenges and opportunities. One of these new opportunities is science communication, or how to communicate our efforts in cancer research and treating cancer patients both within our institution and to the public.</p><h3 id="blog-more-about-research">Blog more about research</h3><p>Science blogging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/08/31/science-blogging-is-the-new-email">means many different things to different people</a>. Blogging about research (your own or that of other people) is one important part of it. In 2008 I have written only a few blog posts about research (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/23/what-are-the-right-numbers-for-jupiter">this one</a>), but I want to do more of it in 2009. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature.com Blogs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://www.researchblogging.org/">Research Blogging</a> are great tools to find blogging about research, and I hope the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://researchblogging.org/news/?p=109">broken integration</a> of Nature Network blog posts with Research Blogging will soon be fixed.</p><h3 id="start-a-new-blog">Start a new blog</h3><p>Related to the last two topics, I might start a new blog. This would be a German-language blog and would be an official blog of our institution. But first I have to convince a few people that such a blog is a good idea. I might ask <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://network.nature.com/people/edyong/profile">Ed Yong</a> for advice, as he writes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/">Cancer Research UK</a>.</p><h3 id="find-good-papers">Find good papers</h3><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://network.nature.com/groups/goodpaper/forum/topics">Good Paper Journal Club</a> is a Nature Network Forum to promote good scientific writing. It is a good idea and the forum has over 200 members and some very interesting discussions, but it is very time-consuming to find good examples of well-written papers. The best approach would be regular contributions by a large number of people, but the incentives for doing so are probably not there. But it is possible to pick well-written papers from a journal I read anyway, so I will try to do that for <em><em>Nature</em></em> in regular intervals in 2009. And in January I will give my first seminar on science writing.</p><h3 id="collaborate-with-fellow-science-bloggers">Collaborate with fellow science bloggers</h3><p>We constantly have many interesting and (sometimes) important discussions. Why shouldn't more of these discussions turn into formal projects, e.g. a paper or a presentation at a science conference? Science bloggers are a very diverse mix of people, and this could lead to some very interesting approaches.</p><h3 id="spend-more-time-cooking">Spend more time cooking</h3><p>I think it is important to also do stuff not related to science. Some fellow Nature Network bloggers write books (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2008/11/15/in-which-books-are-judged-by-covers">Jennifer Rohn</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://stores.lulu.com/siegeofstars">Henry Gee</a>), write about books (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://petrona.typepad.com/">Maxine Clarke</a>), write about music (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://scientistmusicians.wordpress.com/">Eva Amsen</a>), write about food (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://sunday-night-dinner.blogspot.com/">Anna Kushnir</a>) or write about their favorite city (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://network.nature.com/hubs/london/blog/2008/12/09/going-solo">Matt Brown</a>). I like cooking. I don't write about it, but I hope to do more cooking in 2009. Preparing good food is not only tasty and fun, but also a good distraction from the daytime work. And reading a good cookbook (for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923121708/http://www.becomingachef.com/culinary_artistry.php">Culinary Artistry</a>) can be as entertaining as reading a good novel.</p><h3 id="go-to-a-warm-place-in-the-summer">Go to a warm place in the summer</h3><p>This year's summer vacation was basically a trip to London for a long weekend.

XMP was created by Adobe (with XMP support in PDF files since 2001), but is an open standard with backing by others, including Creative Commons<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn3">3</a></sup>. The Digital Object Identifier (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>) is the most important piece of information in the metadata, as the DOI provides a link to the journal publisher website where more metadata can be retrieved. XMP support in scientific PDFs is unfortunately still very uncommon and probably hasn't changed much since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://network.nature.com/people/lindenb/profile">Pierre Lindenbaum</a> checked last year<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn4">4</a></sup>.</p><p>Adding metadata to PDFs seems to be a no-brainer. We have done the same with music (mp3 ID) and photos (IPTC and EXIF) for years and it has been a tremendous help in organizing these files stored on our computers. Unfortunately there aren't too many tools that can extract the DOI or other metadata from the XMP in article PDFs. But I expect more desktop software to support XMP, once XMP support in scientific articles is more widespread. We will then be able to add a journal PDF to our reference manager of choice and have the relevant metadata (including authors, title, journal and issue) automatically filled in. As well as many other creative uses. Until then we need tools like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> that can extract metadata from PDF files without this XMP information.</p><p>For a more technical discussion of XMP in scientific articles, please read the set of blog posts by Tony Hammond<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn5">5</a></sup>,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn6">6</a></sup>,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn7">7</a></sup>.</p><p>fn1. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP Labelling for Nature</a></p><p>fn2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/">Adding intelligence to media</a></p><p>fn3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://wiki.creativecommons.org/XMP">XMP</a></p><p>fn4. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/2007/05/is-there-any-xmp-in-scientific-pdf-no.html">Is there any XMP in scientific pdf?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Direct to consumer advertising (DTCA) – advertising for prescription drugs – is only allowed in the United States (since 1997, when restrictions were loosened) and New Zealand. Drug companies pay for direct to consumer advertising (more than $4 billion in 2005 (Donohue 2007)) because they believe that it increases prescription rates. In a clever study published in the <em><em>British Medical Journal</em></em> in September<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174115/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/05/open_access_is_not_enough_the_source_is_also_important/#fn2"> </a></sup>(Law 2008) Michael Law and colleagues looked at the prescription rates of the drugs etanercept, mometasone, and tegaserod in Canada. DTCA is not allowed in Canada, but English-speaking Canadians see these ads in US magazines and US TV commercials. The study authors found that prescriptions were higher compared to French-speaking Canada (supposedly not using the US media) for one of the three drugs studied (tegaserod). The study authors explain:</p><p>The European Union is considering changes in legislation that would allow direct to consumer advertising (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174115/http://www.pharmalot.com/2008/10/eu-plan-gives-pharma-direct-access-to-patients/">EU Plan Gives Pharma Direct Access To Patients</a>). Not a good idea. Direct to consumer advertising not only means easily identified ads, but also information campaigns about diseases and treatments that are biased towards prescribing a particular drug.</p><p>The problems surrounding direct to consumer advertising are a reminder that open access to scientific and medical information is not enough. Similar conflicts of interest exist when car manufacturers would talk about climate change or crop producers about genetically engineered crops. We need not access to as much information as possible, but rather access to independent and objective information of high quality. Scientific journals and learned societies have traditionally played an important role in this. Once they've built up more reputation, science bloggers could have a bigger role in this in the future.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>Donohue, J. M., Cevasco, M., &amp; Rosenthal, M. B.

Most people also avoid to talk religious beliefs or politics. Confidential information, including unreleased papers, was mentioned several times.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Results of clinical trials can sometimes not only change our understanding of the condition studied, but may also affect the way we practice medicine. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (<em><em>JUPITER</em></em>) is such a study.</p><p>JUPITER was investigating the prevention of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, arterial revascularization, death from cardiovascular causes) by treatment with rosuvastatin compared to placebo. Many clinical trials before have looked at the reduction of cardiovascular events by statin treatment in people with elevated cholesterol levels. But in the JUPITER trial, 17,802 apparently healthy men and women with normal levels of LDL cholesterol (&lt; 130 mg/dl) were included based on age (&gt; 50 years for men, &gt; 60 years for women) and elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (&gt; 2,0 mg/l), a marker for inflammation. The trial was stopped early in March of this year (after a median follow-up of 1.9 years instead of the planned 4 years) because treatment with rosuvastatin significantly reduced the number of cardiovascular events: 0.77 per 100 person-years compared to 1.36 per 100 person-years for placebo. In other words, treating 120 people for 1.9 years with rosuvastatin (at a cost of about $287.000) would prevent one cardiovascular event.</p><p>The JUPITER trial is important not only because it shows that a statin can have a beneficial effect in people with normal LDL cholesterol. Which complicates our understanding on how statins work. More importantly, we now have to reconsider who should be treated with statins. What do we do with a small but significant effect in a large group of apparently healthy people? The treatment is expensive (cardiovascular events can probably be prevented for less than $287.000 by other means, e.g. changes in diet and exercise) and can have side effects (e.g. an increase in newly diagnosed diabetes in the JUPITER trial). And, like most important studies, the JUPITER trial raises a number of important new questions. But instead of discussing some of these questions I rather want to look at how we can obtain information about the JUPITER trial.</p><h3 id="clinical-trial-databases">Clinical Trial Databases</h3><p>Since 2005 all clinical trials have to be registered in publicly available databases, and information about JUPITER is available.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn1">1</a></sup> Since September 2008, newly registered trials also have to report their main outcomes.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn2">2</a></sup> This will become important in the future, as the main outcomes of unpublished trials (most likely trials with negative results) will become publicly available no later than 12 months after data for the last subject were received.</p><h3 id="press-releases">Press Releases</h3><p>JUPITER was stopped early in March 2008 and AstraZeneca (the sponsor of the trial and manufacturer of rosuvastatin) issued a press release.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn3">3</a></sup> Another press release was issued on November 9 when the JUPITER results were first presented publicly.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn4">4</a></sup> As can be expected from press releases, there is selective reporting of the trial results. No absolute numbers for risk reductions were reported, and emphasis was put on relative risk reductions. Instead of the actual number needed to treat (NNT, 120 patients treated for 1.9 years), a projected NNT (25 patients treated for 5 years) was reported. And a significant increase in newly diagnosed diabetes (3.0% vs. 2.4%, p=0.01) was reported as <em><em>“there was a small increase in physician reported diabetes consistent with data from other large placebo controlled statin trials.”</em></em></p><h3 id="presentation-at-a-meeting">Presentation at a Meeting</h3><p>The JUPITER results were presented on November 9 at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association (AHA) in New Orleans. More than 6,000 people were listening to this presentation according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://network.nature.com/people/UD280A82C/profile">James Butcher</a> on the Nature in the Field blog<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn5">5</a>. The abstract of the presentation is available here.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn6">6</a> The abstract also lists the potential conflicts of interest of the study authors (the senior author Paul Ridger Ridker is co-inventor of patents on CRP testing in cardiovascular disease). The AHA issued a press release on that day<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn7">7</a> and commented primarily on the role of CRP testing in the trial.</p><h3 id="journal-paper">Journal Paper</h3><p>The JUPITER study was published in the <em><em>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</em></em> on November 20<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn8">8</a></sup>, but the paper was preleased on the day of the presentation at the AHA meeting. The full-text PDF of the paper is available without subscription. The full paper is of course the best source to all the primary data. As is typical for many medical journals, it contains a structured abstract, which is a nice summary of the paper. Interestingly, the <em><em>NEJM</em></em> is conducting a poll and asks the readers two questions on how the JUPITER results changed their clinical practice.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn9">9</a></sup> And there are over 400 reader comments as of today.</p><h3 id="editorials">Editorials</h3><p>The full paper is discussed in an editorial in the same issue<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn10">10</a></sup>, and is also discussed in an editorial in the British Medical Journal<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn11">11</a></sup>. Only the editorial in the <em><em>NEJM</em></em> is available without subscription, but both critically discuss the paper and put it in perspective.</p><h3 id="traditional-news">Traditional News</h3><p>The JUPITER trial was of course discussed in many traditional news media such as newspapers, radio and television. The <em><em>New York Times</em></em> had a long article<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn12">12</a></sup> where the author had interviewed not only the study authors but also several experts in the field. The article discusses several issues surrounding the study, but failed to report the absolute risk reduction or the number needed to treat (important numbers for the reasons discussed above). National Public Radio discussed the story with two cardiologists, including the author of the editorial in the <em><em>NEJM</em></em> (available as transcript and audio file).<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn13">13</a></sup> The interview is again short on actual numbers, but puts JUPITER in perspective for the typical radio listener. The Nature News article<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn14">14</a></sup> also didn't mention the number needed to treat. Stopping a trial early can be controversial, because the numbers for risks and benefits might look different at the planned end of the trial. Nature News should have talked to someone that was not involved in that decision in the JUPITER trial.</p><h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3><p>Scintilla has aggregated the blog posts on this study<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn15">15</a></sup>. Harriet Hall on the Science-Based Medicine Blog not only has the story with the best title (<em><em>Statins Are Better on JUPITER</em></em>), but gives a detailed analysis of the study results. Ben Goldacre on Bad Science has a shorter blog post that is more of a discussion of absolute risk, relative risk and number needed to treat (as the title of the blog post suggests).<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053051/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/23/what_are_the_right_numbers_for_jupiter/#fn16">16</a></sup></p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>There are many ways we can learn more about the JUPITER trial, and most of this information is freely available, including the full-text of the paper. It is not the access to the primary data that is the problem, but rather the many different ways the results can be put into perspective. And for that we need not only a basic understanding of cardiovascular risks, but also clinical trials. And we should not forget the financial and other interests that are always connected to large trial like this. I didn't do a systematic analysis of the newspaper articles and blog posts about the study, but it is clear to me that science blogs can add an important perspective.</p><p>fn1.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Article Authoring Tag Set of the National Library of Medicine (NLM DTD for short) <em><em>creates a standardized format for new journal articles that can be used by authors to submit publications to journals and to archives such as PubMed Central.</em></em>[1] The Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-in that was released earlier this year reads and writes this format. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://network.nature.com/people/pablofe/profile">Pablo Fernicola</a> from Microsoft first explains the Add-in in a video and then answers a few questions.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-the-microsoft-word-article-authoring-add-in-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what the Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-in is and does?</h3><p>There is an already ongoing transition to digital workflows for journals, as well as a nascent transition to digital distribution and consumption. Generating content that is best suited for digital distribution, as well as for archival, search, and semantic analysis in the future, is going to be essential. As a community, today we are not taking full advantage of the potential that the tools and formats currently in use present to us, and trying to bolt these capabilities to existing print centric processes is costly, inefficient, and does not allow for exercising the benefits afforded by the digital medium. Authoring for print delivery still dominates many of the processes, and constrains the final outcome, even if print distribution is discontinued.</p><p>It is important to realize that the content we generate today is what we will be accessing, and relying on as reference material, in the future. It is imperative that we generate content that is best suited for the way it will be consumed. Also, it would be ideal if this transition could be done in a non intrusive and low cost approach as possible.</p><p>The Article Authoring Add-in for Word 2007<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/#fn2">2</a></sup> is a free download, which provides new capabilities to the Word application, focused on Scholarly Publishing. The overall goal for the Authoring Add-in project is to help improve the scholarly publishing process for workflows that rely on Microsoft Word or Word generated content, covering the authoring experience, editorial workflow, and archiving of STM articles, with an eye towards generating content that is best suited for preservation, digital consumption, and search. A core capability provided by the add-in is the ability to open and save files in the NLM XML format.</p><h3 id="2-how-is-the-authoring-add-in-different-from-commercial-tools-such-asextyles-from-inera">2. How is the Authoring Add-in different from commercial tools such as<br>eXtyles from Inera?</h3><p>The add-in differs in at least the following ways:</p><ul><li>It is targeted at both authors and editorial staff audiences</li><li>It focuses on enhancing the experience within Word, both for authors and editorial staff, and not just for content but also for metadata</li><li>Enables providing a consistent experience for authors, in relation to templates and the entering of metadata, across journals</li><li>Enables two way interaction with the NLM formats (article and book formats), saving and opening NLM files within Word</li><li>Provides a platform for software vendors to build on top of</li><li>Builds on the transition to XML as the underlying native format in Word 2007</li></ul><h3 id="3-what-advantages-do-you-see-for-authors-that-submit-their-manuscripts-in-the-nlm-journal-publishing-xml-format">3. What advantages do you see for authors that submit their manuscripts in the NLM Journal Publishing XML format?</h3><p>The add-in doesn't force authors to submit their articles in the NLM format, but makes the conversion to that format a lot easier as part of the workflow. The add-in provides a way for authors to enter information in their articles so that this content (semantics and metadata) is preserved through the publishing workflow, in a way that is ready to save as a valid NLM document, while still using the Word user interface. I would expect that the more common scenario will be that of journals providing templates and authors submitting docx files, augmented with NLM data through the add-in, and that the journals or repository staff will be the ones doing the conversion to the NLM format.</p><h3 id="4-how-do-you-think-the-author-submission-process-will-change-in-relation-to-formats">4. How do you think the author submission process will change in relation to formats?</h3><p>Many journals already use the NLM format as part of their publishing workflow, as well as for their archival format. Some publishers are moving to the format now. And, certainly for NIH funded research, all articles eventually end up in the NLM format as part of the submission to PubMed Central. But I don't know of any journals that take in the NLM format directly from authors.</p><p>We have tried to take a very end user centric approach in the project. We would like for authors not to have to be aware of the underlying format. We don't want authors to think of XML, for example, as formats should be something that happens in the background, which the authoring tools handle for the authors, and just make the authors' work easier, and their content more easily searchable and relevant.</p><p>In our work with the journals, publishers, and repositories we focus a lot on interoperability based on formats and protocols commonly used in the community, not only in the form of the NLM format itself, but also by incorporating technologies such as SWORD<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/#fn4">4</a></sup> and OAI-ORE<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/#fn5">5</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="5-what-is-your-job-at-microsoft-what-did-you-do-before-working-on-the-authoring-add-in">5. What is your job at Microsoft? What did you do before working on the Authoring Add-in?</h3><p>I have always been involved in software development, working and managing both small and large teams. Currently I am a group manager at Microsoft, in charge of running this overall project, which also includes an online service focused on the peer review process. I drive the development, the technology direction and architecture, and community engagement as it relates to scholarly publishing<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/#fn6">6</a></sup>. Before starting this effort, I worked for many years on developer platform technologies related to text, reading, graphics, and multimedia, both at Microsoft and at Apple, as well as being the Program Manager in charge of the web developer platform in Internet Explorer for a couple of versions of the browser.</p><h3 id="6-do-you-plan-to-also-release-an-add-in-for-microsoft-word-2008-for-macintosh">6. Do you plan to also release an Add-in for Microsoft Word 2008 for Macintosh?</h3><p>We are investigating how we can best bring the authoring focused features to Word 2008 users. On Windows, Word 2007 is now in many ways a developer platform in its own right, there are even software development kits for it, and Word 2007 provides a lot of extensibility and programmability to developers. The equivalent developer support is not provided in Word 2008, with the Macintosh offering's strength being on providing a great end user experience to its end user audience.</p><h3 id="7-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-the-authoring-add-in">7. Do you want to talk about future plans for the Authoring Add-in?</h3><p>We got a lot of feedback on our version 1 of the add-in, which we made available this past July, from folks involved in the back-end of the publishing workflow, such as folks at journals, publishers, and repositories, as well as from companies that provide the software tools and services in support of this work (of note is the integration work we did with Design Science for their MathType package<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/#fn7">7</a>).</p><p>Development work on version 2 is currently underway and we expect to make available a Technology Preview soon, with the final release of version 2 in 2009. In version 1 we focused quite a bit on the architecture and getting the basic infrastructure in place to provide support for the NLM format. In version 2 there is a greater focus on the author experience, as well as on continuing to improve the support for the format.</p><p>Some of the driving questions that we would like to address are:</p><ul><li>in which ways can we make the submission/upload process easier for authors</li><li>Can we make the author and article metadata more reliable and consistent, thereby reducing the roundtrips between authors and the journals, as well as reducing the cost for cleaning up the data?</li></ul><p>And overall, the philosophy is to simplify, simplify, simplify. Especially for authors, help them get the content into the article, and keep the technology in the background. For the staff at journals and repositories, provide them with access to all the richness of the NLM format, and the flexibility that they will need to build their own solutions.</p><p>fn1. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/">Article Authoring Tag Set</a></p><p>fn2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=09c55527-0759-4d6d-ae02-51e90131997e&amp;displaylang=en">Article Authoring Add-in for Microsoft Office Word 2007</a></p><p>fn3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://www.inera.com/extylesinfo.shtml">eXtyles Product Information</a></p><p>fn4. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/reppres/tools/sword">SWORD</a></p><p>fn5. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange</a></p><p>fn6. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://blogs.msdn.com/exscientia/">ex Scientia</a></p><p>fn7. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053041/http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/">MathType</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working in science is as much about reading papers as it is about writing papers. There are usually two ways you can come across an interesting scientific paper:</p><ul><li><em><em>Active Searching</em></em>. Literature search on a particular topic</li><li><em><em>Passive Browsing</em></em>. Scanning the literature in regular intervals for papers of interest</li></ul><p>The focused active search is typically used when you collect information for a research project or write a paper or grant proposal. This is stuff for another blog post and can be better explained by a science librarian like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://network.nature.com/people/obst/profile">Oliver Obst</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://network.nature.com/people/U81B5C465/profile">Frank Norman</a>. Now I want to talk about different ways to keep track of the current literature in your field. I would assume that most if not all people involved in science do this in one way or another, and I also think that many people are struggling with the best strategy (see Richard's related post on this topic: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2008/10/27/too-many-fish-in-the-sea">Too many fish in the sea</a>).</p><p>The basic concept behind browsing is that it is a passive activity where the scientific papers come to you regularly in one way or another. A good strategy should be efficient (not involve too much of your time), cost-effective and should have a good signal to noise ratio (i.e. finds many interesting papers without going through too much uninteresting stuff).</p><h3 id="journal-subscriptions">Journal Subscriptions</h3><p>The old-fashioned way. You receive a print copy of journals of interest in regular intervals and flip through the journal. This strategy works for a few journals, but is usually too expensive and too unfocused as a general strategy. I currently have three personal journal subscriptions, but the main reasons are that I either can't get them in electronic form or have no institutional subscription. Departmental subscriptions that are circulated around help saving some costs. But I have to confess that I haven't been to a library to flip through a few journals for more than 10 years. I very much like the feeling of a printed journal in my hands, but browsing in electronic form is not only cheaper but also much faster (even more so with articles released early in electronic form). Many journals now exist only in electronic form or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/about-bmj/the-bmjs-publishing-model">publish articles continously</a> rather than in a weekly or monthly schedule.</p><h3 id="journal-tables-of-content-toc-by-email-or-rss">Journal tables of content (TOC) by email or RSS</h3><p>I would guess that this is currently the most popular browsing strategy. I prefer RSS to email because it means less clutter in my email inbox and because every journal article is a separate item that can be saved for later. I currently follow 8 journals. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> also uses this strategy, but this feature could be refined in future versions of the program. The TOC strategy probably works best for the leading journals in your field of research, but isn't very efficient for journals with only 1-2 interesting articles per issue, e.g. high volume general interest journals such as <em><em>PNAS</em></em>. Podcasts (e.g. the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/">Nature Podcast</a>) are basically extended TOCs in audio format.</p><h3 id="filtering-by-experts">Filtering by experts</h3><p>You let someone else do the filtering for you. The traditional approach is the review article. The major drawback is of course the delay between publication of the original research and the publication of the review. A different – and faster – approach is used by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://www.f1000biology.com/">Faculty of 1000 Biology</a> (they also have a similar service for medicine). The most interesting papers are highlighted and reviewed by leading researchers in the field. <em><em>Research Highlights</em></em> in <em><em>Nature</em></em> and similar features in other journals try to do the same on a much smaller scale.</p><p>Filtering by experts is a resource-intensive and subjective process, and it is very possible that very exciting research published in an obscure journal might be missed. Most will remember that internet search started out with expert filtering, exemplified by Yahoo. It didn't work.</p><h3 id="filtering-by-author-or-keyword">Filtering by author or keyword</h3><p>A good browsing strategy should consider the papers you have read already. In the approaches mentioned above this happens in your mind when you flip through the table of contents of a journal. A smarter approach is to regularly receive customized searches (again delivered via email or RSS). This is a popular strategy (explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/mj05/mj05_rss.html">here</a> for PubMed) and can involve keywords (e.g. the molecule or organism you work on) or authors (your colleagues and competitors).</p><h3 id="filtering-by-papers-you-read">Filtering by papers you read</h3><p>A more systematic approach would not just pick a few keywords, but would use the information from all the papers you've read already, particulary those that you liked. Social bookmarking tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a> have this information, but only if you give type in all those papers. It is more convenient to use that information directly from your reference manager where you have stored references or even fulltext PDFs to your most important papers anyway. Reference managers are usually used for writing papers and unfortunaly don't yet use this information to help you find interesting papers. One reason I like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/10/03/interview-with-alexander-griekspoor">Papers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123041/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley">Mendeley</a> is that they both have the potential to fill this gap.</p><h3 id="filtering-by-papers-others-read">Filtering by papers others read</h3><p>You probably have guessed that this blog post would somehow suggest a Web 2.0 solution to this problem. The papers stored in the reference manager of other scientists can of course be used to find papers that might also interest you. This process can of course be automated (rather than the personal recommendation from a colleague) and should be anonymous. But neither Connotea nor CiteULike do that, and I don't know of any other online tool currently available.</p><p>In 2010 I want to use a tool that scans Pubmed or other databases for papers of interest based on the papers stored in my reference manager. The tool would give me a weekly report that can also be printed out for reading and note taking.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Ben Goldacre: Bad Science. Published September 2008 by Fourth Estate Ltd. Paperback, 352 pages, ISBN 0007240198</em></em></p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://network.nature.com/people/UA495AB88/profile">Ben Goldacre</a>, blogger of the <em><em>Bad Science</em></em>[1] column in the Guardian newspaper, in September published a book based on material from his blog. Just like the newspaper column, the book is primarily intended for a general audience rather than the trained scientist or medical doctor. And it helps to live in Great Britain, where most of the examples of bad science given in the book happened.</p><p>But the book is not really a collection of scary and sometimes hilarious bad science stories. Ben Goldacre takes these examples and tries to teach the reader evidence-based medicine. Evidence-based medicine<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/24/book_review_bad_science_by_ben_goldacre/#fn2">2</a></sup> or EBM uses the scientific method to make decisions about the care of individual patients. It is funny how many people – including medical doctors – throw away all the research evidence that is available and instead rely on personal experiences. And evidence-based medicine helps to distinguish good research from bad research, e.g. by stressing the importance of randomized controlled trials. The book was very stimulating reading for me, including the chapter about the placebo effect<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/24/book_review_bad_science_by_ben_goldacre/#fn3">3</a></sup>. But I'm a medical doctor, and I don't know whether Ben Goldacre succeeded in every reader with this teaching mission. Even so, most readers will look much more carefully at science stories in the media after finishing the book. And that is a good thing.</p><p>More reviews of the book can be found in these fine publications:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2008%2F09%2F27%2Fbogol127.xml">Daily Telegraph</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg20026772.600-review-ibad-sciencei-by-ben-goldacre.html">TimeOut London</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.a1856">British Medical Journal</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg20026772.600-review-ibad-sciencei-by-ben-goldacre.html">New Scientist</a></li></ul><p>fn1. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://www.badscience.net/">Bad Science</a></p><p>fn2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">Evidence-based Medicine Wikipedia entry</a></p><p>fn3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/my-placebo-programme-on-bbc-radio-4/">Placebo programme on BBC Radio 4</a></p>]]></content>

I would guess that I have access to about 95% of the full-text papers I want to read.</p><h3 id="can-other-people-read-my-publications">Can other people read my publications?</h3><p>I've blogged about this before<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn8">8</a></sup>, and little has changed in the 6 months since that post. Looking at my last 5 papers, only one of them is freely available (because the journal allows free access after 12 months), and for one of them even my own institution doesn't have access. Good publications are still critical to advance my career, so publishing in “good” journals is more important to me than publishing in journals where as many people as possible can read my papers – and most people interested in my work probably also work in institutions with fulltext access. The citation advantage of Open Access papers would be an incentive to publish in Open Access journals, but to me that question still remains unanswered<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn9">9</a></sup>. I currently have limited research funding, so an Author-pays fee is a hurdle for me. I was coauthor of one paper this year that really should have been Open Access. It is a detailed guideline on how to treat patients with testicular cancer and should have been made freely available.</p><h3 id="where-do-i-need-more-open-access">Where do I need more Open Access?</h3><p>Most research never gets published and there are many good reasons why that is so. But the situation is different for clinical research involving the treatment of patients. A clinical trial not only costs a lot of money, but is also potentially harmful to a patient. For these reasons clinical trials need approval by institutional review boards and other institutions before they are even started, acting as a sort of peer review at the beginning. And the desired endpoint for a clinical trial is not necessarily a publication, but rather the approval of a new drug. A recent <em><em>PLoS Medicine</em></em> paper found that only 43% of the clinical trials used for approval of drugs by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were later published<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn10">10</a></sup>. And many other clinical trials with negative results not even appear in the documents submitted for drug approval, meaning that these data are lost forever. This so-called publication bias creates many problems, and is unfortunately encouraged my most journals. Fortunately this situation has recently changed. Clinical trials must be registered in public databases since 2005, and since last month the main results also have to be published in the public database once the trial has been completed<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn11">11</a></sup>.</p><p>fn1. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://openaccessday.org/">Open Access Day</a></p><p>fn2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/10/open_access_day_the_blog_posts.php">Open Access Day – the blog posts</a></p><p>fn3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://friendfeed.com/rooms/open-access-day">Open Access Day FriendFeed Room</a></p><p>fn4. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://www.sciam.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=open-access-publisher-biomed-centra-2008-10-07">Open access publisher BioMed Central sold to Springer</a></p><p>fn5. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://www.oaspa.org/">Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association</a></p><p>fn6. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://mcblawg.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-i-am-oa-advocate.html">Why I am an OA Advocate</a></p><p>fn7. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/10/03/interview-with-alexander-griekspoor">Interview with Alexander Griekspoor</a></p><p>fn8. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/04/11/public-access-week-who-could-read-my-papers">Public Access Week: Who could read my papers?</a></p><p>fn9. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/08/01/article-downloads-and-citations-of-open-access-papers">Article downloads and citations of open access papers</a></p><p>fn10. <em><em>PLoS Medicine</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050191">doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0050191</a></p><p>fn11. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">FDAAA: Push to open data in clinical medicine</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2008 Nobel Prizes will be announced next week, starting with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday. There will be a live webcast on Monday at 9:30 AM GMT for those interested<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn1">1</a></sup>. As every year just before the announcement, speculation about this year's winners is in full swing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://network.nature.com/people/U113B3294/profile">M. William Lensch</a>, here on Nature Network correctly predicted last year's winners<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn2">2</a></sup>, and this year he is trying it again<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn3">3</a></sup>. Thomson Reuters uses scientific methods for their predictions (including citation counts over 30 years and other awards), and they nominate<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn4">4</a></sup> these three discoveries:</p><ul><li>Toll-like receptors and innate immunity</li><li>the role of microRNAs in gene regulation</li><li>the development of meta-analysis and application to clinical medicine</li></ul><p>There will be of course many more blog posts about the Nobel Prizes this week, both on Nature Network<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn5">5</a></sup> and elsewhere. But in this blog post I want to talk about someone who will not win a Nobel Prize, but who would very much have deserved to do so. I am talking about <em><em>Judah Folkman</em></em> who invented the field of angiogenesis research and worked on it for more than 35 years. But the prize can only be awarded to living people, and Judah Folkman passed away this January. A <em><em>Nature</em></em> obiturary<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn6">6</a></sup> and recent <em><em>PNAS</em></em> article<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn7">7</a></sup> summarize his life and scientific achievements. Here I want to explain my personal reasons why I think he would have deserved a Nobel Prize.</p><h3 id="angiogenesis-reseach-is-hypothesis-driven">Angiogenesis reseach is hypothesis-driven</h3><p>Folkman first published his concept of tumor angiogenesis in 1971<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn8">8</a></sup>. He postulated that the recruitment of dedicated blood vessels is essential to tumor growth. It took 25 years of experimental work by Folkman and others until the concept of angiogenesis became widely accepted. Interestingly, another hypothesis that changed our understanding of cancer biology was also published that year: Knudson's two-hit hypothesis of tumor suppressor genes<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn9">9</a></sup>. Judah Folkman often said <em><em>Science goes where you imagine it.</em></em> A lot of today's research is not at all about proving an important hypothesis, and some people even mistakenly propose that concepts are no longer needed<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn10">10</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="angiogenesis-research-is-full-of-failures">Angiogenesis research is full of failures</h3><p>The story of angiogenesis research is a very complicated one. Not only took it Judah Folkman a long time and a lot of subbornness before his views became accepted, but there were many failures and setbacks along the way. Some scientific breakthroughs were an instant success, e.g. RNA interference awarded a Nobel Prize in 2006<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn11">11</a></sup>, but most research is just very complicated, including medical research. A September <em><em>Science</em></em> article about medical interventions found a median interval of 24 years between first description and earliest highly cited article<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn12">12</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="angiogenesis-research-has-had-an-impact">Angiogenesis research has had an impact</h3><p>The number of Pubmed citations is one good indicator for the research activity in a given field. Pubmed today lists 37,482 publications about angiogenesis, including 19985 publications from the last five years. This compares favorably to research about telomerase (8040 publications), and microRNA (3541 publications), two areas of research mentioned in the discussions about potential 2008 winners. Impact can be also measured in other ways, but it is clear that the concept of angiogenesis has not only profoundly changed cancer research, but is also important in many other diseases, summarized in a 2005 <em><em>Nature</em></em> article<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn13">13</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="angiogenesis-research-is-medical-research">Angiogenesis research is medical research</h3><p>As the name already suggests, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine is actually two prizes in one. It is a Nobel Prize in Biology, awarded for major achievements in our understanding of all aspects of biology. But is also a Nobel Prize in Medicine, where major advances in our understanding of human disease are awarded. The 2005 Nobel Prize to Barry Marshall and Robin Warren for the role of Helicobacter pylori in gastric disease<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn14">14</a></sup> is a good recent example of the latter category.<br>The research by Folkman and others has changed the way we think about cancer, but also the way we treat cancer. Each year, more than one million patients with colon, lung or breast cancer are treated with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab. Other drugs targeting angiogenesis are either already in clinical use (e.g. sunitinib for renal cancer) or in development. This makes angiogenesis research a prime example for translational research. I very much agree with the views expressed in a set of articles in <em><em>Nature</em></em> this June<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn15">15</a></sup>, that more has to be done to connect our much better understanding of fundamental biological processes to the way we diagnose, prevent and treat diseases. And a Nobel Prize would be a strong signal.</p><p>fn1. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://nobelprize.org/prize_announcements/medicine/index.html">Announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a></p><p>fn2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://network.nature.com/people/U113B3294/blog/2007/09/15/nobel-redux">Nobel Redux</a></p><p>fn3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://network.nature.com/people/U113B3294/blog/2008/10/03/nobels-2008">Nobels 2008</a></p><p>fn4. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://scientific.thomsonreuters.com/nobel/">2008 Nobel Predictions</a></p><p>fn5. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://network.nature.com/groups/nnbloggername/forum/topics/3062">Collective Blogging – Nobel Prize announcements</a></p><p>fn6. <em><em>Nature</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/451781a">doi:10.1038/451781a</a></p><p>fn7. <em><em>PNAS</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0806582105">doi:10.1073/pnas.0806582105</a></p><p>fn8. <em><em>N Engl J Med</em></em> 1971 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4938153?dopt=abstract">Tumor angiogenesis: therapeutic implications</a></p><p>fn9. <em><em>PNAS</em></em> 1971 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://www.pnas.org/content/68/4/820">Mutation and Cancer: Statistical Study of Retinoblastoma</a></p><p>fn10. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory">The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete</a></p><p>fn11. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2006/index.html">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2006</a></p><p>fn12. <em><em>Science</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1160622">doi:10.1126/science.1160622</a></p><p>fn13. <em><em>Nature</em></em> 2005 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/dx.doi/org/10.1038/nature04478">doi:10.1038/nature04478</a></p><p>fn14. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/index.html">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2005</a></p><p>fn15. <em><em>Nature</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://dx.doi/org/10.1038/453839a">doi:10.1038/453839a</a></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good software solves a problem. When one journal after another switched to PDF as electronic document format, and journals started to appear only in electronic form, storing papers as printouts in folders became impractical. But the PDF files will soon start to clutter the hard drive, despite efforts to organize them by topic, year or author. At least for Macintosh users, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053037/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> is one practical and elegant solution to this problem. I talked with Papers author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053037/http://network.nature.com/people/mekentosj/profile">Alexander Griekspoor</a> not only about Papers, but also about his career switch from cell biologist to software developer.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-describe-what-papers-is-and-does">1. Can you describe what Papers is and does?</h3><p>The tag-line we coined for Papers is “your personal library of science”, a play-of-words on the well-known PLoS acronym. And this program for the Mac provides exactly that, it helps you manage and organize your personal scientific literature library. It provides a complete workflow for finding new articles using built-in search engines, browsing the publisher’s website using the built-in Safari web browser, downloading, archiving and renaming the PDF files, and organizing and indexing these articles. Finally, it allows you to easily read the papers and share them with colleagues.</p><h3 id="2-how-is-papers-different-from-other-macintosh-bibliography-tools">2. How is Papers different from other Macintosh bibliography tools?</h3><p>Papers distinguishes itself from other bibliography tools in that it is not a typical reference manager to begin with. The Mac has had several good reference management applications for a long time already, but when I created Papers I wanted to make a different application, one that didn’t exist yet and one there was clearly a need for, one to manage all those PDF files that people were downloading. In the years before, the publishing industry had introduced PDFs as a replacement for sending articles by regular mail and it was a great success in that it made access to the literature much easier.</p><p>Still, their support of the researcher ended the moment you pressed the download button. Your web browser would save some cryptically named PDF file on your hard disk, which soon quickly filled up with dozens of these files. So whereas PDFs were introduced to save us from the messy file cabinets with hundreds of paper copies of your articles, we were now facing the digital equivalent of that on our desktop.</p><p>That was when it struck me that Apple had already solved this issue for MP3 files a few years earlier, iTunes had allowed us to stop bothering about managing MP3s and instead allowed us to focus on the songs. Papers was designed to do exactly the same when it comes to managing PDFs and instead lets us focus on the articles. Obviously, now the have seen how things can be different you notice that most reference managers on the Mac have started to play catch up, and are introducing PDF management features as well. Still, for us this has always been the key element and is just the start of many exciting things to come.</p><h3 id="3-what-recommendations-do-you-give-windows-and-linux-users">3. What recommendations do you give Windows and Linux users?</h3><p>The most obvious answer is to buy a Mac of course 😉 But more seriously, at the moment I’m not aware of a program on Windows or Linux that offers the same feature set and user experience that Papers offers. But like the other reference management tools on the Mac there’s a similar trend of adopting<br>these kind of features in bibliography tools on Linux and Windows as well.</p><h3 id="4-what-did-you-do-before-working-on-papers">4. What did you do before working on Papers?</h3><p>Perhaps surprisingly I’m a cell biologist of training and not a computer scientists or IT person. I studied medical biology at the Free University in Amsterdam and ended up doing my PhD at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam as well, where I studied the immune system using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053037/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2005.04.007">live-cell fluorescence microscopy</a>.</p><h3 id="5-how-did-you-get-involved-in-writing-macintosh-software">5. How did you get involved in writing Macintosh software?</h3><p>It all started out as a hobby driven by a long-time interest for both design and technology. I was introduced to the Mac when my dad brought home one of these “portable” classic Macs when I was about 14 years old, and almost immediately I started experimenting with Photoshop et al. During university I earned some money in my spare time by designing and building websites, but it wasn’t until about the time I started by PhD that Apple introduced Mac OS X and with it came the free set of developer tools that finally made it easy enough for someone without the classical IT background to start building his/her own Mac applications. Together with my best friend and fellow PhD student Tom Groothuis we started building a number of tools for molecular biologists (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053037/http://mekentosj.com/enzymex/">EnzymeX</a>), which we distributed for free under our “mek en tosj” monicker. It didn’t take long before the hobby started to get out of hand as the popularity of our programs started to soar.</p><h3 id="6-you-talked-about-your-postdoc-choice-in-a-2007-nature-jobs-article-what-made-you-decide-to-move-from-postdoc-to-company-founder">6. You talked about your postdoc choice in a 2007 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053037/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nj7130-948b">Nature Jobs article</a>. What made you decide to move from postdoc to company founder?</h3><p>When the time came to pick a postdoc I knew one thing for sure, the programming was something I was so passionate about that it should be part of the postdoc rather than a spare time project. That’s why I picked the text mining group at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053037/http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> in Cambridge UK, also driven by an interest in the changes that were/are ongoing in the scientific publishing industry. I applied for a two year EU Marie Curie fellowship which I was fortunate to get, however it would take a few months between the end of my PhD and all the bureaucracy before I could get started in Cambridge. This was when I decided to build Papers. I got the idea for this “iTunes for PDF files” already two years earlier, but never had the time to do it. I did tell everybody I knew about it, but no one had done it and now finally I had some spare time on my hands.</p><p>The first beta of the program was released right at the time I started my postdoc and it was a success right from the start. In fact it was so successful and offered so many opportunities that it was soon difficult to focus on my actual postdoc and after a year I realized that this was the thing I was really passionate about and was what I wanted to concentrate fully on. That was when I decided to quit my job and become the company founder of Mekentosj Inc. 😉</p><h3 id="7-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-papers">7. Do you want to talk about future plans for Papers?</h3><p>It’s still to early to talk in many details but like I said, for us the current version of Papers has always been the foundation on which we can build many exciting things we envision.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog post is about presentations. And this usually means PowerPoint presentations, although some people do well without it<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup>. Edward Tufte argues that PowerPoint can be a really bad tool to create slides<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn2"><strong>2</strong></a></sup>. But it is probably not the software, but rather the people that produce these slides that are responsible for the quality<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn3"><strong>3</strong></a></sup>. The Neurotic Physiology blog published a list of things you shouldn’t do during a Powerpoint presentation<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn4"><strong>4</strong></a></sup>. But there are also many tips to create better presentations. A May 2008 <em>Nature Methods</em> editorial<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn5"><strong>5</strong></a></sup> gives ten such suggestions. Links to some more Powerpoint tips were collected in a Nautilus blog post<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn6"><strong>6</strong></a></sup> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/maxine/profile"><strong>Maxine Clarke</strong></a>. One positive example is this presentation by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mza/profile"><strong>Matt Wood</strong></a><strong> </strong>from the Science Blogging London conference:</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://www.slideshare.net/mza/how-to-make-friendfeeds-and-influence-people-presentation?type=powerpoint">How to make Friendfeeds and influence people</a></p><p>View SlideShare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://www.slideshare.net/mza/how-to-make-friendfeeds-and-influence-people-presentation?type=powerpoint"><strong>presentation</strong></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://www.slideshare.net/upload?type=powerpoint"><strong>Upload</strong></a> your own.

Google Docs and Zoho Show have been around for a while now, but 280Slides<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn7"><strong>7</strong></a></sup> is a fairly new offering with a very slick interface. The advantages of these programs: slides can be created by several authors working together and slides can be easily shared. But presentations created with Powerpoint can also be shared online. Slideshare and Scribd are the most popular tools for this, and since last week these presentations can be embedded into Nature Network blog posts. By default, these presentations are public and can be seen by everybody. But they can also be uploaded as private presentations and only those that know the secret URL can see them. Presentations in the life sciences can also be uploaded to Nature Precedings<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn8"><strong>8</strong></a></sup>. This way the scientific presentation receives a DOI and becomes citable. But Nature Precedings has still a long way to go with currently only about 50 presentations available. Which is a bit surprising, since it looks like the perfect platform to host conference presentations.</p><p>YouTube videos or podcasts are probably the preferred format to share presentations that also include the recorded audio. Having the audio available is especially important for those presentations that have little text on their slides. Many presentations from the TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn9"><strong>9</strong></a></sup> have been made available as TEDTalks, including this one by Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor:</p><p>If you want to give a presentation remotely (i.e. to one or more people in a different location), you could use that feature in Google Docs<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn10"><strong>10</strong></a></sup>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>German Academic International Network (GAIN)</strong><sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup> informs German researchers working in North America about research opportunities in Germany. The implied intention is to lure German researchers back to Germany. GAIN project director Katja Simons explains:</p><p><em>Many german researchers abroad are highly interested in returning but they need support creating networks and receiving information on career opportunities in Germany. Germany has invested a great deal in their education and is in need of these bright minds and their experience they gained abroad.</em></p><p>GAIN is a joint initiative by the <strong>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AvH)</strong>, the <strong>German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)</strong> and the <strong>German Research Foundation (DFG)</strong>. Their 8th annual meeting took place two weeks ago in Boston<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn2"><strong>2</strong></a></sup>. More than 200 researchers working in North America participated, together with representatives from many German research organizations, including Matthias Kleiner, president of the German Research Foundation (DFG)<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn3"><strong>3</strong></a></sup> and Margeret Wintermantel, president of the <strong>German Recotors’ Conference</strong> (HRK, the association of all higher education institutions in Germany)<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn4"><strong>4</strong></a></sup>. Representatives from business and politics (members of the parliament) were also present.</p><p>To get a more personal perspective, I talked to two researchers that attented the meeting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/profile/avmaier"><strong>Alexander Maier</strong></a>, a research fellow at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/affiliations/735"><strong>NIH</strong></a>, thinks that the GAIN meeting was a success. Sceptical at the beginning of the conference, he acknowledges that things have changed and that doing reseach in Germany has become much more attractive. The <strong>excellence initiative</strong> by the German Government is one big reason for that change<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn5"><strong>5</strong></a></sup>. The most rewarding part of the program for him was the workshop on how to apply for professorhips.</p><p>Florian Jaeger, an assistant professor from the University of Rochester (his blog is here<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn6"><strong>6</strong></a></sup>) is on the GAIN advisory board. He also got the impression that the German reseach system is changing, and that</p><p><em>Many institutions in Germany seem to be inspired to learn from the positive aspects of the American system (and maybe even to improve on it).</em></p><p>But both Alexander and Florian felt that the research environment in Germany is still far from perfect, and the German research organizations should not think that all problems have been solved. Startup grants are often relatively low and junior research groups are usually not as independent as in the United States. And Florian thinks that the research atmosphere – the way people interact and approach problems – is still more stimulating in the United States.</p><p>Most reports about the GAIN meeting are in the German media, including the newspapers Hamburger Abendblatt<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn7"><strong>7</strong></a></sup> and Süddeutsche Zeitung<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn8"><strong>8</strong></a></sup>. I found one blog post from a German postdoc attending the meeting<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn9"><strong>9</strong></a></sup>. Nature Network is a good place to have a discussion not only about the research environment in different countries, but also to learn more about similar strategies carried out by other countries, e.g. France, Italy, Japan or China.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Conference 2.0</strong> – A scheduled meeting of people sharing a common interest that takes advantage of Web 2.0<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup> concepts.</em></p><p>Scientific conferences are essential both for the exchange of ideas and for networking. But they don’t have to be organized the same way as 10-20 years ago. Web 2.0 tools now allow much broader user participation before, during and after the conference. Technology conferences have seen this change already<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn2"><strong>2</strong></a></sup>. We also already have open source software to organize conferences<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn3"><strong>3</strong></a></sup>. I’ve collected a few of those ideas and concepts below.</p><p><strong>1. Keep the conference small</strong><br>Active user participation works better in smaller conferences, e.g. not more than maybe 150 participants (derived from Dunbar’s number<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn4"><strong>4</strong></a></sup> introduced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/profile/duncan"><strong>Duncan Hull</strong></a>). This will exclude large or very large conferences – the largest scientific conferences today have more than 10.000 participants. But those larger conferences can still adopt some of the principles discussed below.</p><p><strong>2. Allow for user input to the conference program</strong><br>Even though most scientific conferences ask for abstract submissions well before the conference, the conference schedule is ultimately decided my a small program committee. But conference organizers could well ask for user input about session topics. In the BarCamp or unconference format, the conference program is even decided on the first day of the conference<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn5"><strong>5</strong></a></sup>.</p><p><strong>3. Provide free WiFi</strong><br>This is essential for liveblogging about the conference. And free WiFi in combination with a good conference website with detailed schedule, message boards and practical information would greatly reduce the amount of printed material that needs to be handed out at the conference.</p><p><strong>4. Set aside time for networking</strong><br>There should be enough time (and space) between sessions to talk to the other conference participants. After all, this is one main reason for many people to attend a conference. And the conference organizers can facilitate networking in other ways. Poster sessions (see below) are one way, a very short introduction by every participant (either in person or on the conference website) is another idea.</p><p><strong>5. Pay attention to poster sessions and discussions</strong><br>Conferences can have other session formats than oral presentations. Poster sessions are an often neglected part of many conferences. But they are a great tool for networking, especially with younger scientists. The conference organizers should set aside enough time and avoid parallel oral sessions. Providing drinks and food also helps. Round-table discussions are another underused format with a lot of potential.</p><p><strong>6. Encourage blogging</strong><br>There should be a clear policy regarding blogging stated at the conference website. And this policy should make it easy for conference participants to blog. This means no preregistration and no required affiliation with a news service or journal. Conference organizers should provide a tag for the conference so that blog entries can be tracked.</p><p><em>Blogging about the conference is encouraged by the conference organizers. Please use the tag *conference</em>name* for all your blog posts. Please don’t blog about sessions marked <strong>non_public</strong> in the conference program. They contain information that should not become become public at this time, e.g. because they discuss unpublished results. For further questions regarding blogging at the conference, please contact …_</p><p>There are many different ways to blog about a conference, microblogging via FriendFeed is currently a very popular option<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn6"><strong>6</strong></a></sup>.</p><p><strong>7. Produce podcasts</strong><br>Podcasts with audio and video of the slides are a great way to capture oral sessions at a conference. They are espcially valuable for those unable to attend. This week’s <strong>Science in the 21st Century</strong> conference is a good example of how this can be done<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn7"><strong>7</strong></a></sup>.</p><p><strong>8. Organize parallel local conferences</strong><br>The costs and annoyances of traveling, combined with concerns about the carbon footprint<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn8"><strong>8</strong></a></sup> have led to new concepts. Instead of following the conference from the distance via live-streaming or live-blogging, why not organize several parallel local conferences<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn9"><strong>9</strong></a></sup>?

Good Web 2.0 tools for scientists primarily try to solve a problem. But by adding a social aspect, they will gain useful features that would otherwise not be possible. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/profile/U27CE62BB"><strong>Eva Amsen</strong></a> has recently written a great blog post about this<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup>. Many of these new services have overlapping functions, e.g. almost all of them allow the user to maintain a list of contacts. This raises two questions:</p><ol><li>Which of these sites has (or have) the features that I’m most interested in?</li><li>Do any of these sites work with the commonly used desktop tools and with each other, so that I don’t have to maintain duplicate information, e.g. the list of my publications?</li></ol><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/profile/U42E63119"><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></a> in August posted an open letter to the developers of these sites<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn2"><strong>2</strong></a></sup> and also started a comprehensive list<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn3"><strong>3</strong></a></sup>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/profile/http-network-nature-comprofilegerrymck"><strong>Gerry McKiernan</strong></a><strong> </strong>collects information about social networking sites for scientists on his SciTechNet blog<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn4"><strong>4</strong></a></sup>. Mendeley<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn5"><strong>5</strong></a></sup> is one of these new Web 2.0 sites for scientists (they launched in August), and I spoke with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/profile/U4C4A58A2[6"><strong>Victor Henning</strong></a>, one of the founders of Mendeley, about it.</p><p><strong>1. Can you describe what Mendeley is and does?</strong><br>Mendeley is actually two things: Mendeley Desktop and Mendeley Web. Mendeley Desktop is free academic software (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) for managing &amp; sharing research papers. Mendeley Web lets you back up your research papers online, shows you research trends in your academic discipline, and connects you to like-minded researchers.</p><p><strong>2. What is the connection to Last.fm?</strong><br>There is a conceptual as well as a personal connection. Conceptually, in the long run Mendeley aims to do for research what Last.fm did for music. For those of your readers who don’t know Last.fm, this is how it works: When you install Last.fm’s desktop software on your computer, it will monitor which music you listen to and automatically build a profile of your musical taste on the Last.fm website. The website then recommends you music that you might like, shows you statistics about the most popular songs and artists in your favourite genre, and lets you discover people with a similar taste in music. By aggregating the listening habits and tags of its 20 million users, Last.fm has managed to create the largest ontological classification (and the largest open database) of music in the world – it would be great if we could achieve the same for research papers.</p><p>So, if you install Mendeley Desktop on your computer, you can manage and share research papers on your machine, but you can also upload your papers to your private account on Mendeley Web to access them online. Mendeley Web anonymously aggregates the metadata of these papers to generate statistics about the most popular authors and papers in your research discipline, and – in the future – generates recommendations for papers which you might like. One thing that we handle very differently from Last.fm is privacy: The Last.fm website lets everyone know which music you listen to, whereas Mendeley Web keeps all your research data in your private account which can’t be accessed by anyone else. The conceptual parallels between Last.fm and Mendeley are outlined in more detail in a talk I gave both at the EuroScience Open Forum 2008 in Barcelona and at the Southampton Open Science Workshop<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn7"><strong>7</strong></a></sup>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317im_/http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/2822784112_f01ed9673b_o.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><p>Besides the conceptual similarities, the personal connection to Last.fm is Dr. Stefan Glänzer. He was Last.fm’s first investor and executive chairman, and now has the same role at Mendeley. My co-founder Jan and I first met him back in 2003, when he was a guest lecturer in Entrepreneurship at our university, the WHU Vallendar<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn8"><strong>8</strong></a></sup>, and we contributed a case study to the book he published together with our professors. So when we were looking for funding, we approached him again in June 2007, he was fascinated by the idea of Mendeley and luckily decided to join us. He also brought us in touch with the former founding engineers of Skype, who became investors as well.</p><p><strong>3. What are your responsibilities within Mendeley?</strong><br>I do most of the conceptual work behind Mendeley and write the specifications for our developers: What is the vision of Mendeley Desktop and Mendeley Web in the long term, which features should we develop next to get there, how does each feature work in detail, right down to questions like “where do we place this button and how do we label it?”. So you can blame me for all the usability problems you might encounter.</p><p>I’m also responsible for staying in touch with the academic community and incorporating its wishes into the Mendeley development roadmap, which has the enjoyable side effect that I get to travel to all these wonderful academic conferences. Next week, I’ll be at the Science in the 21st Century conference at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo/Ontario<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn9"><strong>9</strong></a></sup>.</p><p><strong>4. What did you do before starting to work for Mendeley?</strong><br>Until a little more than a year ago, I thought I’d pursue an academic career – I’m currently finishing my Ph.D. on decision-making and choice at the Bauhaus-University of Weimar. I’ve been saying “currently finishing” for almost a year now, but I’m hopeful that I’ll manage to submit my thesis by the end of this year :-) Prior to that, I’ve worked in film production and the music industry a lot, and I opened a café/bar<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn10"><strong>10</strong></a></sup> opposite the WHU in parallel to writing my master’s thesis. I actually left Vallendar the day after the opening night to pursue my Ph.D. in Weimar, so I had all of the work and little of the fun of owning a café/bar!</p><p><strong>5. What is your policy regarding users sharing their PDF files of publications with others?</strong><br>I think it’s important to point out that we’re not a “Napster for research papers” – i.e. no free-for-all peer-to-peer filesharing. Quite a lot of people are disappointed when I tell them that! Sharing is currently limited to “Shared Document Groups” of max. 10 people (e.g. a lab, or collaborators on a research paper), although you can create and join as many Shared Document Groups as you like. Also, as we state in our terms of use<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn11"><strong>11</strong></a></sup>, you may only share PDFs with the permission of the copyright owner – e.g. your own articles or working papers, articles from Open Access databases, articles under a Creative Commons/Scientific Commons license, or perhaps when you and the person you are sharing the PDF with both have licensed access to the database the PDF was taken from.</p><p>We also encourage users to post their own papers and working papers on their Mendeley profiles – depending on whether they have permission to do so from their publishers. As you can imagine, we’re big fans of Open Access!</p><p><strong>6. How is Mendeley different from other desktop reference managers such as Endnote?</strong><br>There are a number of things that make Mendeley Desktop unique, but I’d probably highlight the collaboration aspect, the “automatic metadata extraction”, the online back-up/multi-machine support, and the cross-platform support:</p><ul><li>As far as I know, Mendeley Desktop is the only desktop reference management software that lets you share and collaboratively annotate research papers. We’re also working on a “groups” feature in Mendeley Web which labs can use for discussions, sharing files, setting up a lab blog/wiki etc. – all of this will tie into the reference management seamlessly.</li><li>The “automatic metadata extraction” is quite unique as well: When you drop your PDFs into Mendeley Desktop, it will automatically extract the full-text to make it searchable, try to guess the correct metadata from the full-text (author, title, journal, volume, issue etc.) so you don’t have to type it in manually, and also parse each documents’ cited references, so you can add them to your library as well.</li><li>Due to the integration with Mendeley Web, you can back-up your entire library for online access through simple drag &amp; drop in Mendeley Desktop. Also, this means that you can install Mendeley Desktop on multiple computers and easily synchronize your PDF library across them via the Mendeley Online Library.</li><li>Last but not least, Mendeley Desktop is the only desktop reference manager that is available on all three major platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux).</li></ul><p>Not to mention that, in comparison to solutions such as EndNote, RefMan, RefWorks etc., which cost hundreds of Euros per license, Mendeley Desktop is completely free.</p><p><strong>7. How is Mendeley different from other social networking sites for scientists?</strong><br>While social networking is an aspect of Mendeley Web, we don’t see ourselves primarily as a social network. We don’t believe that social networking in itself is the killer feature that researchers are looking for – rather we’re using a social network to enable researchers to share their data. I think that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/profile/neilfws"><strong>Neil Saunders</strong></a>, who is also here on Nature Network, said it best: “Really, it’s our data that needs to be social, not ourselves”. So we’ve tried to develop a research tool which is useful without any network effects, and which uses networking as a means rather than an end.</p><p>To invoke the analogy to Last.fm again: Even though people have profiles on Last.fm and can connect to each other, Last.fm is not primarily a social network. Last.fm connects the music first, and networks of people form around the music as a second step.</p><p><strong>8. Does Mendeley integrate with other social networking sites and services for scientists, e.g. Connotea or CiteULike? Does it integrate with desktop reference managers?</strong><br>At the moment we’re focusing on increasing the speed and stability of Mendeley, as well as introducing more features which make Mendeley useful as a standalone software. However, compatibility with Connotea or CiteULike is something we’ll be working on in the near future.</p><p>Regarding integration with other desktop reference managers: At the Science Blogging Conference<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn11"><strong>11</strong></a></sup> I briefly spoke to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/profile/mekentosj"><strong>Alexander Griekspoor</strong></a>, the developer of the Mac software Papers<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080920001317/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/05/interview-with-victor-henning-from-mendeley#fn12"><strong>12</strong></a></sup>, whether we couldn’t make our software compatible so that Papers users and Mendeley Desktop users could share and synchronize their collections online. As for EndNote: It’s already possible to import/export data to/from Mendeley in the EndNote XML format – but, sadly, I don’t think that EndNote’s developers would be inclined to enable online sharing between EndNote and Mendeley.</p><p><strong>9. Do you want to talk about future plans for Mendeley?</strong><br>Sure! Besides speed and stability, which I already mentioned, we’ll be working on two main issues to better integrate Mendeley into the research workflow. First, there will be a “cite-while-you-write” plugin for Microsoft Word (or Open Office, if our users would prefer that), so that you can generate reference lists from your Mendeley library automatically. Similarly, we’ll improve the integration with LaTeX by automating the BibTeX file export from Mendeley Desktop. Second, we’ll introduce a “bookmarklet” like the ones CiteULike or Connotea have, which lets you import metadata/papers from websites into your Mendeley Online Library with a single click. This metadata will then be automatically synchronized with the Mendeley Desktop library on your computer.</p><p>The Microsoft Word/LaTeX integration and the online bookmarklet will be available very soon. Over the coming months, we’ll also introduce OCR to Mendeley Desktop, so that you can extract metadata, full-text and references from older scanned-image documents; we’ll integrate Mendeley Desktop with external databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science; we’ll implement the groups/lab management feature on Mendeley Web that I already mentioned; there will be much more detailed research trend statistics on Mendeley Web; we’ll introduce the recommendation engine for academic papers, and many more little goodies. For example, a frequent user request has been automatic PDF file renaming based on the metadata – so that’s going to be in one of the next versions.</p><p><strong>10.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The just finished conference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080125/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html">Science Blogging 2008: London</a> was a wonderful chance for real-life socialising networking. I started to upload some fotos to Flickr (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080125/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mfenner/2813527160/">Scott Keir explaining sign language</a>, see all fotos tagged <em><em>sciblog</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080125/http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/sciblog/">here</a>), some of them are too embarrassing and I will keep them for bribes reference later on.</p><p>The meeting was also a great opportunity to think about where we are today with scienceblogging. Having a conference is a good sign that the field is evolving<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080125/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/08/31/science_blogging_is_the_new_email/#fn1">1</a></sup>, and you can see several subdisciplines evolving:</p><ul><li>conference blogging (also includes event blogging)</li><li>edublogging</li><li>metablogging (blogging about blogging, by far the largest discipline)</li><li>research blogging (blogging about scientific experiments, the smallest discipline)</li><li>investigational blogging (the keynote lecture by Ben Goldacre described this very well)</li><li>evolution blogging (a large subdiscipline)</li><li>news blogging (blogging about science news)</li><li>watercooler blogging (small pieces of interesting or funny thoughts/pictures)</li><li>summary blogging (summarizing other blog posts and linking to them)</li><li>diary blogging (blogging as a personal diary of self-expression)</li><li>hoax blogging (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080125/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2008/04/confessions-of-april-fool-and-dope-on.html">this</a> example by Jonathan Eisen)</li></ul><p>There is no particular order to this list and there are certainly more disciplines and some of the names could be catchier. Most bloggers will blog in more than one category. But these categories can help to think about what you are doing in your own blogging. And it helps when you think about blogrolls or blogging networks such as Nature Network or scienceblogs.com. Could we for example see a conference blogging network in the future?</p><p>We ended the conference with a challenge to recruit more senior faculty for science blogging. Jonathan Eisen is a professor at U.C. Davis and might try an April Fools joke again next year, but faculty new to blogging will probably be more interested in conference blogging, edublogging and research blogging (the boundaries between the three can be blurry). I am all for this challenge, as it will move science blogging forward. And next week I will meet a department head that wants to start blogging. Maybe we can put up another challenge for the next science blogging conference: have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080125/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/07/12/nobel-blogging">blogging Nobel Prize winner</a> as keynote speaker.</p><p>I finally get to the title of this post. Henry Gee made some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080125/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/henrygee/2008/08/30/professor-steve-steve-to-claim-political-asylum-shock-horror-probe">very thoughtful comments</a> in the plenary session at the end. Blogging is much closer to the informal discussions you have in the hallway or via email than it is to peer-reviewed papers. We have to convince faculty members (and other people involved in science) that blogging is the new email. Just as email was either unknown or looked at in a funny way 20 years ago, blogging will become a tool of daily life for most scientists. We can wait until the current generation of children and young students is old enough to become faculty members themselves, or we can promote the use of science blogging to shorten this time.</p><p>fn1. Will we soon have a discussion about starting a journal?</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog entry is primarily intended for science educators that are interested in starting a blog for their teaching activities. Some of them will not be familiar with blogging and other web 2.0 tools. Not the typical audience of this blog, but I would greatly appreciate feedback, as I'm in the process of writing an article about this topic (in German).</p><h3 id="what-is-blogging-and-all-this-web-2-0-stuff">What is blogging and all this web 2.0 stuff?</h3><p>A good starting point is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://plcmclearning.blogspot.com/">Learning 2.0</a>, a self-learning program originally intended to teach librarians about blogs, wikis, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, RSS, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> tools.</p><h3 id="why-should-i-start-a-blog">Why should I start a blog?</h3><p>Because a blog could help with teaching students. A blog can serve as a simple noticeboard for lecture topics, homework assignments, etc. It is also a great place to post additional material. But more importantly, students can comment, ask questions or make suggestions. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://ncwcbio101.wordpress.com/">This class</a> by Bora Zivkovic is one example. Oliver Obst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.slideshare.net/obsto/science-blogs-and-online-forums-as-teaching-tools-the-library-view-presentation/">pointed out</a> that blogs (and other online tools) can save time (and money) compared to one-by-one interactions in person or via email. The motivation for students is nicely explained in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/2008/08/17/teaching-online-with-drupal/">this blog post</a> by Meredith Farkas: blogging or posting comments on blogs is a great way for students to reflect what they have learned and to discuss it with fellow students. Tony Griffith recently talked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.sciencebridge.net/uploads/akt-ver-attatchments/Griffiths_icg_08.pdf">why do students find genetics so difficult to learn?</a>. He emphasized that students typically are not taught the <em><em>research mode</em></em>, where thinking and problem-solving are more important than learning facts.</p><h3 id="where-do-i-host-the-blog">Where do I host the blog?</h3><p>Most teaching blogs will be hosted at a university server. The university IT department will probably offer a blogging platform such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. If the university IT department doesn't offer such a service, blogs can also be hosted somewhere else. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.edublogs.org/">Edublogs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.21classes.com/">21classes</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.classblogmeister.com/">Class Blogmeister</a> not only offer blog hosting, but offer additional features such as a central portal for all blogs, class blogs, access restricted to students, control of student entries.</p><h3 id="where-can-i-find-other-people-interested-in-edublogging">Where can I find other people interested in edublogging?</h3><p>Many science bloggers are also involved in edublogging, and you find interesting discussions about edublogging both here in Nature Network or in many other science blogs (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://search.technorati.com/edublog">here</a>). The Edublogs magazine (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://magazine.edublogs.org/2008/01/28/who-are-the-top-edubloggers/">this post</a> on popular edubloggers) is another good starting point.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most scientific papers are now published in English, and I believe that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040415/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/01/16/should-all-papers-be-published-in-english">this trend</a> is good for international collaboration. Therefore I believe that blogs intended for scientists should also be written in English. The topics and discussions in German language science blogs are often similar to what we discuss in English, and it makes the audience much smaller if we restrict ourselves to a particular language (the same could be said about French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese or Chinese blog posts).</p><p>But there are good reasons to write German language science blogs, and the German science blogosphere is indeed very active.

Textile is a markup language, and Andrew Sun has nicely put together the most important tags in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/andrewsun/2007/09/09/textism-a-better-guide-to-formatting-in-nature-network">this blog post</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, Textile doesn't much help with formatting that is specific to science blogging. Specifically, there is no standard way to link to journal articles. Should we use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>, should we link to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.pubmed.gov/">Pubmed</a>, or should we link to the journal homepage? If we do the latter, should we link to the fulltext (that might not be accessible to everybody) or the abstract? And why is there no standard markup for this?</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a>, the platform behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, uses a different markup language.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago today I wrote my first blog post on Nature Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research"><strong>Open access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research</strong></a>). This is blog post #84 one year later and a good time to reflect on the experience. In May of last year I started the science blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://blog.xartrials.com/"><strong>in a nutshell</strong></a>, hosted on my own server and written just for fun. I discovered Nature Network in July and started <strong>Publish or Perish 2.0</strong>. In November 2007 I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/11/11/a-case-for-goobledygook"><strong>changed the blog name</strong></a> to <strong>Gobbledygook</strong>.</p><p>I try to write about the paper writing process from the perspective of a researcher. I’m interested in the technical changes in paper writing thanks to Web 2.0. Open access is another important topic and the perspective of a researcher is obviously very different from a journal publisher, science library or the interested public. I am sometimes not comfortable to write about open access, as this is a very political topic and the discussion can move away from arguments and into something about doing the right thing. That’s why I would never write about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design or some of the other hotly debated topics in science blogging.</p><p>The blog post that received the most comments is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/06/14/my-paper-writing-dream-machine-1-0"><strong>My Paper Writing Dream Machine 1.0</strong></a>. That was also one of my favorite blog posts as I would love to see more of the potential of Web 2.0 technologies in our paper writing tools. I also enjoyed the dicussion on posters at scientific meetings (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/03/01/are-posters-worth-the-effort"><strong>Are posters worth the effort?</strong></a>) and on blogging from conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/05/17/scientific-meetings-need-more-bloggers"><strong>Scientific meetings need more bloggers</strong></a>).</p><p>I participated in a wonderful SynchroBlogging effort on April Fools Day (organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/"><strong>Jonathan Eisen</strong></a> and with “help” from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://homepage.mac.com/jonathan_eisen/Wabda/Wabda.html"><strong>World Anti-Brain Doping Authority</strong></a>) with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/01/what-can-erythopoetin-do-for-you"><strong>What can Erythopoetin do for you?</strong></a>. I think we should do more SynchroBlogging, and not just on April 1st. <strong>Public Access Week</strong> was another SynchroBlogging effort and I learned a lot about access to my own papers in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/11/public-access-week-who-could-read-my-papers"><strong>Public Access Week: Who could read my papers?</strong></a>.</p><p>Only two blog posts are about scientific research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/02/07/using-rna-interference-to-identify-genes-that-protect-from-cancer"><strong>Using RNAinterference to identify genes that protect from cancer</strong></a> was my contribution to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.justscience.net/2008/?page_id=1368"><strong>Just Science 2008</strong></a>. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/07/14/mouse-models-of-human-cancer-and-the-need-for-more-translational-research"><strong>Mouse models of human cancer and the need for more translational research</strong></a> I wrote about a presentation by Mario Capecchi at the International Genetics Conference. I would love to do more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.researchblogging.org/index.php"><strong>ResearchBlogging</strong></a>, but I think that we have to wait a few more years before science blogging has attracted enough people that read and comment on specific research findings.</p><p>Thanks to this blog I have met a number of very interesting and intelligent people with similar interests (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/eurotrip_08_berlin_part_iii_we.php"><strong>this blog entry</strong></a> by Bora Zivkovic and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/london/news/blog/matt/2008/07/12/dinner-with-the-nobel-prize-winners"><strong>this blog entry</strong></a> by Matt Brown). That’s why I’m very much looking forward to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html"><strong>Science Blogging 2008: London</strong></a> conference at the end of this month. My goal for the next year: help to make reading and writing science blogs part of the everyday life at more universities and reseach institutions.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2005 registration of clinical trials in publicly available databases before the first patient was entered became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611042509/http://www.icmje.org/clin_trial.pdf">mandatory</a> for papers submitted to the most important medical journals. In September of last year, U.S. President Bush signed the Federal Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA) into law. Starting September 2008, all clinical trials registered in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611042509/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</a> database (with the exception of phase I trials) have to report key results of the main outcomes no later than 12 months after data for the last subject were received.</p><p>This required reporting of results has so far largely gone unnoticed in the medical community, but will dramatically change the way research involving patients is conducted and reported. The 12 month deadline will probably lead to earlier reporting of many trial results, and not publishing negative results will be much more difficult. The required reporting in a standardized format will also facilitate the meta-analysis of several similar trials.</p><p>Reporting of trial results in this format <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611042509/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7605/1177">will not be considered previous publication</a> by member journals of The Internal Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <em><em>British Medical Journal</em></em> this week published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/jul31_1/a568">Open access publishing, article downloads, and citations: randomised controlled trial</a> by Phlip Davis et al. There are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040157">several publications</a> that looked at the full paper downloads and citations of open access papers compared to closed access papers. But this is the first prospectively randomized study, thus avoiding some of the typical problems of retrospective evaluations (e.g. that important papers are more likely to have free access).</p><p>Articles published in 11 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://www.the-aps.org/">American Physiological Society</a> journals between January and April 2007 were randomly (1 out of 7) made open access at the time of publication. Full text viewing, PDF downloads and citations were measured over a 12 month period. The authors found a significant increase in readership (full text HTML and PDF) but no difference in citation rates.</p><p>There are plausible arguments why citation rates weren't different between the two groups. Most researchers that cite APS papers in their own publications will have institutional access to these journals. But citation rates of open access papers are a political topic, that's why we already have a number of reactions from the blogosphere (e.g. from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2008/07/31/open-access-doesnt-drive-citations/">The Scholarly Kitchen</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?%2Farchives%2F441-Davis-et-als-1-year-Study-of-Self-Selection-Bias-No-Self-Archiving-Control%2C-No-OA-Effect%2C-No-Conclusion.html">Stevan Harnard</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.com/">Gunther Eysenbach</a>). There are also some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/337/jul31_1/a568">direct responses</a> to the paper at the BMJ website. The main criticism of the paper is the short time of 12 months to look at the citation rate. The citations will increase in the next few years, but because all papers from APS journals are made available as full text after 12 months, there will be no longer a difference in access to the two groups of papers.</p><p>What surprised me post about the paper is the journal. I would have expected that it would appear in an APS journal, but a medical journal? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040451/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/337/jul31_1/a1051">editorial</a> explains the reasoning behind it. Like many other journals, the BMJ is trying out new access models. All research papers (but not the other content, including the editorial) in the BMJ are open access. And as Fiona Godlee in the editorial puts it:</p><blockquote><em><em>Academic publishing is going through interesting times. We don</em>'<em>t know which model will prevail, or indeed whether there will ultimately be one or several coexisting models.</em></em></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The German medical journal <em><em>Deutsches </em>Ä<em>rzteblatt</em></em> did an analysis of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085236/http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/article.asp?id=60949">percentage of female first authors over the last 50 years</a>. The number was 0-4% as recently as 25 years ago, but there has been a yearly increase to 18% last year (see this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085236/http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/bild.asp?id=24380">figure</a>), both for submitted and accepted manuscripts. This number corresponds to the percentage of female senior faculty in Germany, but 64% of students starting to study medicine last year were women. A similar increase – although to higher numbers – has been seen in biology (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085236/http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.10160">this study</a>).</p><p>These numbers seem to indicate that women are neither less likely nor more likely to have a manuscript accepted. Unless you assume that women are more often denied first authorship than men. But I was surprised to learn how little progress had been made between 1957 and 1982. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085236/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/3/281">This study</a> of female first and senior authorship in American medical journals probably gives the explanation. The numbers of female medical students didn't start to rise until the 1970s, and they probably started to write their first papers about ten years later. Which would mean that in another 25 years female first and senior authors in medical journals should be as common as their male colleagues. Isn't that a bit long in the future?</p>]]></content>

I haven't seen anybody trying to create formal categories, but I see <em><em>research blogging</em></em>, <em><em>conference blogging</em></em>, <em><em>watercooler blogging</em></em>, <em><em>comic strip blogging</em></em> – and <em><em>edublogging</em></em>. Breakout session 5 of the conference is called <em><em>Science blogs and online forums as teaching tools</em></em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://medinfo.netbib.de/">Oliver Obst</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/jeffmarlow">Jeff Marlow</a> and myself will try to organize an interesting panel discussion on the topic. Edublogging covers a wide range of topics, as you can guess when looking at these (random) science education blogs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://sciencegeekgirl.wordpress.com/">Sciencegeekgirl</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://www.stevespangler.com/">Steve Spangler</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://blog.makezine.com/">MAKE: Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://micropopbio.org/">Microbial Population Biology</a></li></ul><p>The last blog is especially interesting. It is hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://edublogs.org/">Edublogs</a>. They not only provide a hosting platform for teacher and student blogs, but also offer special features that are especially useful for educational blogging, e.g. managing and aggregating student blogs and sharing material.</p><p>My interest in this topic started when we began the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/group/goodpaper">Good Paper Journal Club</a> here on Nature Network. Some questions I would like to address in the session include:</p><ul><li>How are educators (professors, teachers, etc.) using blogs?</li><li>How are students using blogs?</li><li>How are science libraries using blogs?</li><li>Are there special features required for edublogging, e.g. team blogs, restricted access, sharing of documents?</li><li>Do university administrators facilitate blogging on education?</li></ul><p>Please leave your comments either here or in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/forums/sciblog2008/2105">Science Blogging 2008: London</a> forum.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2008-07-19T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>James Evans, a sociologist from the University of Chicago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091345/http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1150473">reports</a> his research on the kind and frequency of citations over the last 60 years in the latest issue of <em><em>Science</em></em>. He found a change in citation behavior as more and more journals became electronically available: fewer journals and articles were cited and the cited articles were more recent.</p><p>These findings seem to contradict our expectations (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091345/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.321.5887.329a">research by other groups</a>). The greater availability of research papers in recent years thanks to electronic publication (and open access) should broaden and not narrow the papers that we read and ultimately cite in our own publications. But looking at my own behavior when reading papers or writing a publication, and thinking about many discussions we had on related topics, these findings make perfect sense.</p><p>Today's technology allows us to make the distribution of scientific papers in electronic form very efficient, and thanks to this technology we have new business models (author-pays) and an ever-increasing number of journals. Access to research articles is now easier, cheaper and for a broader audience than in ever was before. This is of course a wonderful development, but unfortunately creates a new problem: <em><em>information overflow</em></em> and how to filter out the relevant information.</p><p>Twenty years ago the typical researcher would use the personal or institutional journal subscription to regularly follow the important papers in his field. <em><em>Index Medicus</em></em> and <em><em>Current Contents</em></em> were used to find additional articles, but they were cumbersome to use. Today few researchers regularly read printed journals. Most papers are found by searches of online databases and by subscriptions of tables of content by email or RSS. There are many clever tools to facilitate this, but most people probably are overwhelmed by the information and stick to some very specific research interests and high-profile journals.</p><p>This is where the filtering of information becomes critical. Technology can help a great deal in finding the most relevant research papers, but I would argue that human intervention is still far more important. For most people including myself peer review is the first step in that filtering process. Connected to peer review is the editorial decision that something is not only scientifically sound but also interesting. This editorial decision is sometimes debatable but is a very effective filtering process. Post-publication filtering by human intervention in the form of comments, voting or paid services (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091345/http://www.f1000biology.com/">Faculty of 1000 Biology</a>) is still in its infancy.</p><p>I am hoping for better filtering tools in the future, both pre- and post-publication. I'm confident that technology can be a big help (especially when full-text searching takes off), but will never replace human editing. Until then, maybe we should kep at least some important print subscriptions so that we don't miss that fascinating research paper that for some reason wasn't picked up by that fancy electronic tool.</p><p>David Crotty (in his highly recommended blog <em><em>Bench Marks</em></em>) also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091345/http://www.cshblogs.org/cshprotocols/2008/07/18/scientific-citations-and-the-alleged-death-of-the-long-tail/">blogged about this topic</a>. Philip Davis also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091345/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2008/07/18/online-journal-paradox/">wrote about</a> the <em><em>Science</em></em> article on <em><em>the scholarly kitchen</em></em> blog.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Sunday morning at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/">International Congress of Genetics</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.botany.ubc.ca/people/griffith.htm">Tony Griffiths</a> gave an interesting presentation with the above title. He identified 12 possible reasons why students have problems learning genetics. His main argument: students should learn concepts and principles and apply them creatively in novel situations (the <em><em>research mode</em></em>). Instead, too many details are often crammed into seminars and textbooks. In other words, students often stay at the lowest level of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Bloom%27s_Taxonomy">Bloom's taxonomy</a>, the remembering of knowledge. The highest level, the creation of new knowledge, is seldom reached, although these skills are of course critical for a successful researcher.</p><p>Andrew Moore from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.embo.org/scisoc/index.html">EMBO</a> talked about the teaching of genetics in the classroom. He was concerned that a survey found that molecular evolution (or molecular phylogeny) was taught in not more than 30% of European classrooms. He gave some examples of how principles of genetics can be integrated into high school teaching.</p><p>Wolfgang Nellen explained his successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.siriuswork.de/sciencebridge.net/tmp/">Science Bridge</a> project of teaching genetics in the classroom, using biology students as teachers. Interestingly, they have not only taught high school students, but also journalists and – priests (German language link <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/artikel/770/134514/">here</a>). Politicians were the only group of people that weren't interested in his offer of a basic science course.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2008-07-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the opening lectures this Saturday of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091608/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/">International Congress of Genetics</a> was held by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091608/http://capecchi.genetics.utah.edu/">Mario Capecchi</a>. His talked was entitled <em><em>Modeling human disease in the mouse: from cancer to neuropsychiatric disorders</em></em>. In the first half he described his mouse model of synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive and often fatal soft tissue tumor. The pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood, but synovial sarcoma is characterized by a t(X;18) translocation that creates a fusion of the SYT and SSX (SSX1, SX2 or SSX4) genes.</p><p>Early and ubiquitous expression of a SYT-SSX transgene is lethal in the mouse embryo, so Mario Capecchi's group created a mouse that expresses the fusion gene only at specific timepoints and only in skeletal muscle. Practically all mice develop tumors that resemble synovial sarcoma in human. This mouse model provides an attractive preclinical platform for new treatment strategies. Those interested in the full story can read the Cancer Cell paper (Haldar 2007) that was published last year.</p><p>Everybody has a different reason to be interested in research. It can be the curiousity to better understand a fundamental process, It can be the wish to create a business opportunity. It can be the determination to do something about climate change or poverty. Or it can be the desire to better help a patient with a disease that is difficult or impossible to treat. I trained as a medical doctor and currently spend most of my time treating patients with cancer. Just last week I was seeing a young patient with synovial sarcoma and lung metastasis. Understanding the biology of cancer is essential to find better treatment strategies and we have witnessed many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091608/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib">positive examples</a> for this.</p><p>This so-called translational research is unfortunately a wonderful concept that more often than not doesn't work in practice. Basic science often is poorly connected to clinical medicine, both on a personal and institutional level. But change is apparently underway, if you believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091608/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7197/index.html">the cover story</a> of the June 12 issue of Nature.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>M HALDAR, J HANCOCK, C COFFIN, S LESSNICK, M CAPECCHI (2007).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 20th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091433/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/">International Congress of Genetics</a> started in Berlin yesterday. This is the first time that I attend a meeting as a science blogger. An interesting experience since you look at the talks from a different perspective and you have to try to cover topics that are of general interest but often not really your area of expertise.</p><p>The conference started yesterday afternoon with a press conference with Rudi Balling, Alfred Nordheim, Mario Capecchi, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, Oliver Smithies and Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker. The International Congress of Genetics takes place every 5 years, but wasn't held in Germany since 1927. The main reason for this is the horrible crimes that were done between 1933 and 1945 in the name of “Eugenics” [1]. This dark history of Genetics in Germany was also discussed at the press conference. On July 14 there will be a special announcement by the German Society for Human Genetics (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091433/http://www.gfhev.de/en/index.htm">GfH</a>), as this is the 75th anniversary of a German law that allowed the sterilization of people with “genetic” diseases against their will. The GfH will say that they deeply regret the behavior of German geneticists during that time. This is a topic that has special meaning to me, since one of the leading German geneticists involved was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091433/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otmar_Freiherr_von_Verschuer">Ottmar von Verschuer</a> who is a cousin of my great-grandmother. The German Research Foundation (DFG) did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091433/http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/KWG/guests_e.htm">extensive research</a> on the involvement of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Society (which became the DFG after 1945) in the crimes committed between 1933 and 1945 in the beginning of this century (see this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091433/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/full/425650b.html">Nature News</a> article).</p><p>Another topic debated in the press conference was the use of genetics to treat patients, more specifically gene therapy and stem cells. Mario Capecchi and others stressed that ethical decisions on these issues should be done by society and that the scientists would only provide the tools. Oliver Smithies pointed out that we should make the clear distinction between somatic gene therapy and gene therapy targeting the germline, and that the latter approach would be not only risky but in most cases uneccessary.</p><p>The expectations for the conference were nicely summarized by Oliver Smithies, who said that science happens in unexpected jumps, and that these jumps are often produced by people from whom you don't expect it.</p><p>fn1. I previously blogged about how the journal Nature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091433/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/10/23/nature-in-nazi-germany-70-years-ago-no-open-access">was banned</a> in Germany 70 years ago.</p>]]></content>

It was a very entertaining evening, not least because of our special guests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091423/http://www.pathology.unc.edu/common/smithies.htm">Oliver Smithies</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091423/http://capecchi.genetics.utah.edu/">Mario Capecchi</a> (both 2007 Nobel laureates) and Matt Brown (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091423/http://network.nature.com/london/news/blog/matt/2008/07/10/medley-of-medals-for-london-scientists">Nature Network London Editor of the Year</a>). Just one of the many stories was by Oliver Smithies, who told us how he constructed a PCR machine after listening to a talk by G. Mullis – way before commercial Taq polymerase and PCR machines. And that machine is still running.</p><p>You could argue that surprisingly few people showed up for this event, including only four PhD students. But I don't worry too much about this, because increasing the awareness for these events takes time. But I wonder whether we could do better to disseminate the knowledge and life experience of these accomplished scientists. Time and travel costs allow only relatively few people to listen to keynote lectures or take part in a networking dinner.</p><p>The solution is obvious: we have to convince our Nobel laureates to become science bloggers. In many ways they are the perfect bloggers. Most of them probably don't know yet about science blogging, and some of them will need help with the technology. And perhaps only a few will be interested. But with a little help this could turn out very well.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/06/14/my-paper-writing-dream-machine-1-0">Paper Writing Dream Machine</a> I obviously need a reference manager. My list of required features includes:</p><ul><li>Easy addition of references by integration with Pubmed, Google Scholar and other online databases. A special bookmarklet would be a bonus.</li><li>Commenting on references, e.g. custom tags or free-form text</li><li>Creation of reference lists, e.g. by tags</li><li>Sharing of reference lists to user-defined groups or to everybody</li><li>Integration of the references into your word processor of choice. An export function into a common format such as .ris is a minimum. A better solution would be an open programming interface (API).</li></ul><p>For obvious reasons (sharing references with your coauthors) an online reference manager is the easiest way to accomplish these feature requests.</p><h3 id="connotea"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://www.connotea.com/">Connotea</a></h3><p>You import references into Connotea via bookmarklet or by entering the DOI. A direct query of Pubmed is not possible. References can be tagged and commented on. Unfortunately it is not possible to create a reference list for a particular paper that is only seen by your coauthors (Connotea groups are all or nothing). References can be exported into common formats, but no direct word processor integration. A Connotea Web API is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://www.connotea.org/wiki/WebAPI">available</a>.</p><h3 id="citeulike"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a></h3><p>CiteULike is very similar in features to Connotea. The same limitations (no private group for reference list, no word processor integration) also apply.</p><h3 id="2collab"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://www.2collab.com/">2collab</a></h3><p>A newer service created by Elsevier. Again similar in features to CiteULike and Connotea. Private groups for your coauthors to share a reference list are supported. No direct word processor integration. 2collab has a public API.</p><h3 id="refworks"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a></h3><p>In contrast to Connotea and CiteULike this is a commercial product (our university has a subscription). Again no direct integration with Pubmed (only copy and paste), but a bookmarklet. And again difficulties to create a list of references that is visible just to your coauthors. Write-n-Cite is a RefWorks plugin for Microsoft Word. No API.</p><h3 id="endnote-web"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://www.endnoteweb.com/enwebinfo.asp">EndNote Web</a></h3><p>EndNote Web is promoted as a sort of Endnote Lite, i.e. a web-based tool with just the basic features of the commercial desktop application. Again no direct Pubmed Search, but integration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://isiknowledge.com/">Web of Science</a> (just like Endnote a product from Thomson Scientific). Sharing of reference lists to just your coauthors is possible. Endnote Web comes with a Microsoft Word plugin for ease paper writing.</p><p>With the exception of Connotea and 2collab, all the systems mentioned above allow you to store the full-text PDF. This is a handy feature, but online storing of creates copyright issues for papers that are not public access.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092952/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, a Firefox extension, is not on this list, because references are stored locally and cannot easily be shared with others.</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the tools supports all my requirements. Endnote Web comes closest, but is far from perfect (e.g. sometimes slow, also needs Web of Science). Is it so difficult to build a Pubmed query function and group reference list into the tools?</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2008-06-14T14:41:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written a similar post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/03/31/pubmed-and-other-annoyances-in-the-paper-writing-process"><strong>before</strong></a>, put I would like to talk about some of the features that I would like to see in an ideal paper writing application.</p><p><strong>Intelligent Formatting</strong><br>Content and formatting should be separated from each other. A manuscript should require as little formatting as possible, and that formatting (including the format of references) should be defined in a Journal style that is automatically applied to the manuscript. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.wolfram.com/products/publicon/index.html"><strong>Publicon</strong></a> by Wolfram Research tried to achieve this, but unfortunately appears to be a dead product.</p><p><strong>References</strong><br>A reference database should be integrated into the paper writing application. Ideally this would be a web-based database such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.connotea.org/"><strong>Connotea</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.citeulike.org/"><strong>CiteULike</strong></a>. Both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.refworks.com/"><strong>Refworks</strong></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.endnoteweb.com/enwebinfo.asp"><strong>EndNote Web</strong></a> already offer some level of integration.</p><p><strong>Versioning</strong><br>Storing all versions of a manuscript is very important for obvious reasons: backup, keeping track of revisions and coordinating the input from more than one author. Version control is standard practice in software development, using tools like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://subversion.tigris.org/"><strong>Subversion</strong></a> or the newer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://git.or.cz/index.html"><strong>Git</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Integration with Online Submission Systems</strong><br>Submitting a manuscript to an online manuscript submission system such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/home.htm"><strong>EditorialManager</strong></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.topazproject.org/trac/"><strong>Topaz</strong></a> is too complicated. This process could and should be automated.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong><br>My Paper Writing Dream Machine will in all likelihood turn out to be a web-based application, using on one of the more advanced platforms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://gears.google.com/"><strong>Google Gears</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://silverlight.net/"><strong>Microsoft Silverlight</strong></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.adobe.com/de/products/flex/"><strong>Adobe Flex</strong></a>. And the data will be in XML using a standard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition"><strong>DTD</strong></a>. Some of the pieces of the puzzle already exist, but nobody has yet put them together in a way that it creates a compelling alternative to the currently used systems.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/are-posters-worth-the-effort">said before</a> on this blog, I do like poster sessions. The poster sessions at the just finished <a href="http://www.asco.org/">American Society of Clinical Oncology</a> meeting didn't offer food and drink, but were otherwise very enjoyable. The meeting is probably special because a lot of high quality research will be presented as poster, as there is just not enough time for enough oral sessions. Many of the poster presenters were senior faculty. I also like the printouts that were available from most posters – but there still was a lot of picture taking with digital cameras. A very good feature was the oral summary of some of the poster sessions: 15 minute presentations of 5-10 posters, summarized and commented on by an expert in the field.</p><p>I had some very informative discussions with a number of poster presenters. When you are familiar with the research topic it is often possible to go straight to the interesting issues, the nonlinear and interactive format of a poster is then often better than an oral presentation. The downside of a poster presentation is obviously that the format is good for presenting to a small audience only. But the poster presenter will usually get much more feedback than from an oral presentation.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/how-technology-can-help-you-to-survive-a-meeting"/>
        <updated>2008-06-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm currently in Chicago at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092305/http://www.asco.org/ASCO/Meetings/ASCO+Annual+Meeting">annual meeting</a> of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). This is a large meeting on clinical cancer research with about 30.000 people attending. Rather than writing about the specific research presented and discussed at the meeting, I would like to talk about how (web) technology can help in having a better conference. I will focus on two (obvious) issues:</p><ul><li>How do I find the relevant information out of thousands of abstracts and sessions?</li><li>How can I benefit from the meeting even if not physically present?</li></ul><p>ASCO has done a number of things to help. All <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092305/http://www.abstract.asco.org/">meeting abstracts</a> where made available a few weeks before the meeting. The meeting program is available online, and you can create your person schedule that you can print out or export to you calendar software. The schedule is also available for Palm users. At the meeting, you find free WiFi throughout the conference. Most talks are made available as videocasts (for a fee now, made publicly available October 1) or podcasts. ASCO also even has an educational session with three talks titled <em><em>Using the Internet to Keep Current: From Podcasts to Virtual Meetings to RSS</em></em>.</p><p>Information about the meeting is difficult to find. With the exception of blogs and websites that cover the meeting form a business perspective – results from clinical trials presented at the meeting can have a profound impact on the stock performance – there isn't a lot of blogging about the meeting (as discussed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092305/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/05/17/scientific-meetings-need-more-bloggers">here before</a>). This means that the filtering out of the interesting information still has to be done the traditional way, basically going through the 5000+ abstracts.</p><p>Conclusion: The meeting organizers provide a number of wonderful tools, but they haven't yet discovered Web 2.0. More blogging or online discussion would make the meting much more interesting. And the function to create a personal schedule could be greatly enhanced by using user input, e.g. listing the most popular talks or allowing you to share your schedule with a colleague. You can get a lot out of the meeting even if you are not physically present, but the information filtering has still a way to go.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2008-05-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week Matt Brown announced important changes to the Nature Network software: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://network.nature.com/london/news/blog/matt/2008/05/21/the-first-step-towards-new-local-hubs">The first step towards new local hubs</a>. Most importantly, it is now possible to set your location and hub. The hub can be the same as the location, or a city or region nearby (as in my case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://network.nature.com/hubs/berlin">Berlin</a>). Later this year, Nature Network will add new hubs to the existing London and Boston. Hubs that are now picked by many people are more likely to become full-fledged hubs. Some of the early popular hubs include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://network.nature.com/groups/nyc/notice/2008/05/20/join-the-new-york-hub">New York</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://network.nature.com/forums/scibarcamp/1597">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://network.nature.com/forums/berlin/1596">Berlin</a> (there are certainly more, but there is no way for me to see them listed).</p><p>As we know from the London and Boston hubs, local hubs have local events listings, local meetups, local news and jobs information. We had several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/maxine/2008/05/08/web-2-0-and-biology-8-may-2008">discussions</a> here on Nature Network of what Web 2.0 can bring to scientists and that only those tools and increase the productivity or add something new will become popular. Local event and job listings for scientists are two services that I see as extremely valuable, basically I don't see any way other than as Web services to do them properly.</p><p>Location information is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of the Web and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://en.oreilly.com/where2008/public/content/home">Where 2.0</a> conference on the topic just finished earlier this month. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</a>, a tool to assign a unique identifier to every researcher, is one example where scientific information is mapped to locations. You can see a map of my paper coauthors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://labs.researcherid.com/mashlets/rid/mashletsServer.jsp?rid=A-7225-2008&amp;mid=CollaborationNetwork&amp;cat=Map">here</a>.</p><p>Scientific research and communication is not bound to locations, but local networks are at least as important as virtual networks. We of course all do this already for many years, but we are just starting to figure out how social networks such as Nature Network can enhance our physical networks and connect them to the larger virtual network. Philipp Selenko has a clear vision, he sees this as a great opportunity for PhD students to do the same kind of networking that is usually restricted to seasoned faculty (and often happens behind closed doors). Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102855/http://network.nature.com/forums/berlin/1332">his post</a> on the Berlin forum for more details.</p><p>And please join the Berlin hub if you work in that region.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2008-05-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In one of my first blog posts (before I joined Nature Network) about a year ago I wrote about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102648/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/6/6/asco_2007_meeting">American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2007 Meeting</a>. I was surprised that only a handful of blogs reported about the event, one of the largest and most important meetings for clinical cancer research.</p><p>One would think that blogging and scientific meetings would be a natural combination. Those that can't go to a meeting need a filtered summary, and a blogging scientist would be a perfect person for the job. The experience with blog posts about technology meetings also says that this should work. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102648/http://blogs.nature.com/news/blog/">In the Field</a> is Nature's blog about conferences and events and there is the occasional blog post about a meeting.</p><p>So why are there not more bloggers at science meetings? I think that this is simply a problem of critical mass. 1) there are still not enough science bloggers around and 2) most science blogs (including this one) don't write about research results, but rather about other aspects of science. This could well change in a few years and I expect to see an increasing number of science blogs reporting from meetings. And I will try to blog about the most interesting sessions in the fields of leukemia and lymphoma when I go to ASCO 2008 in Chicago at the end of the month.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last issue of Nature, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080514/full/453275a.html">news feature</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7193/full/453260a.html">research highlight</a> look at two recent high-profile paper retractions. The two papers by biochemist Homme Hellinga delt with rational enzyme design. A second group couldn't reproduce the results, ultimately leading to the paper retractions. Then a third group was able to demonstrate that rational enzyme design is indeed possible.</p><p>The research highlight looks at the troubles of the second reseach group led by John Richard. He wasted a lot of time and money trying to reproduce Hellinga's findings and in the end did not gain anything.</p><p>Non-reproducible work is a common problem in research, and papers containing this questionable work are rarely retracted. I would guess that most of the time this is unintentional. John P. A. Ioannidis explains this in an PLoS Medicine essay: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why most published research findings are false</a>.</p><p>Sometimes the reasons behind non-reproducible results can be calculated, and this includes drug trials in clinical medicine. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/23/3482">Statistical Power of Negative Randomized Controlled Trials Presented at American Society for Clinical Oncology Annual Meetings</a> found that more than half of these randomized controlled trials that showed no benefit for a new treatment did not have enough patients to detect even a medium-sized treatment effect.</p><p>What should we do about this? The first step is to accept the fact that a significant number of research findings you read in a paper are not reproducible. We have to be careful to start a PhD thesis or other research project based on a few exciting papers, especially when this work was done by someone else. Thinking about this, I should have taken that advice myself before starting a particular project 5 years ago.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://www.cshblogs.org/cshprotocols/2008/02/14/why-web-20-is-failing-in-biology/">success or failure</a> of Web 2.0 efforts for scientists depends to a large extend on the availability of cool applications that make the everyday life of a scientist easier. Many of these applications of course already exist, but I would argue that there is a lot of room for improvement. And I would also argue that in a lot of cases we just have to take the example of the Web 2.0 world and adapt it to the needs of scientists – Nature Network itself would be an example of this approach.</p><h3 id="meetings-and-seminars">Meetings and Seminars</h3><p>Scientific meetings and seminars are one example were we can do better. Web 2.0 is an ideal approach for this, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://upcoming.yahoo.com/">Upcoming</a> is the classic application. There are of course a number of websites that list meetings and seminars for scientists, but they either focus on the big meetings or list just the seminars of a particular institution. Look at the discussion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://network.nature.com/forums/berlin/1360">How to find a science event in Berlin</a> in the Nature Network Berlin Forum to see what I mean.</p><h3 id="what-can-we-do-to-improve-the-situation">What can we do to improve the situation?</h3><p>We can wait that either one of the big players or a clever startup has a great idea. But one of the attractive features of Web 2.0 is user participation. We need more discussions between scientists and software developers on what is needed and what can be done. These discussions are of course already taking place, but science bloggers can do more to collect interesting ideas and articulate them. We want the integration of reference managers in online writing tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://www.buzzword.com/">Buzzword</a>, but how do we make our voice heard?</p><p>Secondly, we can write applications ourselves. The barriers of entry have become really low, and one reason are the APIs (application programming interfaces) of both science applications or conventional Web 2.0 apps:</p><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/eutils_help.html">Pubmed</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://www.scopus.com/scsearchapi/">Scopus</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/ianmulvany/2007/08/14/java-wrapper-for-the-connotea-api-now-available">Connotea</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://code.google.com/apis/documents/overview.html">Google Docs</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://technorati.com/developers/api/">Technorati</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://developer.ebay.com/common/api/">eBay</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361">Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://developer.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a></li></ul><p>And there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://www.ghastlyfop.com/blog/2007/10/facebook-code-on-bebo.html">hints</a> of a Nature Network API.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I received email invitations from three different journals to submit a research article. I should have felt flattered, but it is unclear why it is me that received invitations to the journals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://la-press.com/journal.php?journal_id=4"><em>Biomarker Insights</em></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://la-press.com/journal.php?journal_id=103"><em>Genomics Insights</em></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://www.medsci.org/"><em>International Journal of Medical Sciences</em></a>. All three journals already exist for a few years, and I wouldn't say that the focus of my research is biomarkers or genomics.</p><p>Then I thought about a recent blog post by Gunther Eysenbach: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.com/2008/03/black-sheep-among-open-access-journals.html">Black sheep among Open Access Journals and Publishers</a>. In this post he calls the sending of unsolicited emails simply spamming and argues that <em><em>there are also throw-away journals out there from shady publishers trying to cash in on the current surge of interest in open access publishing.</em></em></p><p>And this is what all three journals mentioned above have in common: they are open access journals and the author pays for the (accepted) article. It is obvious that any journal that gets paid by the author is interested in soliciting articles whereas a subscriber-pays journal would be interested in attracting new readers. There is nothing wrong with this, but there are two potential problems. (1) Like most people I don't like spam. (2) Journals with an author-pays business model have to be extremely careful about the quality of their papers.</p><p>Potential authors should first check whether the journal (if it is a biomedical journal) is indexed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=journals">Medline</a> (Genomics Insights is not) and either has a reasonable impact factor or (for new journals) receives enough citations.</p>]]></content>

The results aren't pretty.</p><h3 id="most-journals-allow-posting-post-prints-on-a-university-website">Most journals allow posting post-prints on a university website</h3><p>The copyright agreement with the journal is the easy part. Most publishers allow posting of post-prints (after peer-review, but not the journal PDF) in a non-commercial repository, usually the repository of your institution. Below are the policies of three prominent publishers.</p><h3 id="elsevier"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/supportfaq.cws_home/rightsasanauthor">Elsevier</a></h3><blockquote><em><em>As an author, you retain rights for a large number of author uses, including use by your employing institute or company. These rights are retained and permitted without the need to obtain specific permission from Elsevier. These include (…) the right to post a revised personal version of the text of the final article (to reflect changes made in the peer review process) on the author's personal or institutional web site or server, with a link to the journal home page</em></em></blockquote><h3 id="springer"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.springer.com/authors/journal+contributors?SGWID=0-154202-12-467999-0">Springer</a></h3><blockquote><em><em>An author may self-archive an author-created version of his/her article on his/her own website. He/she may also deposit this version on his/her institution's and funder's (funder-designated) repository at the funderâ€™s request or as a result of a legal obligation, including his/her final version, provided it is not made publicly available until after 12 months of official publication. He/she may not use the publisher's PDF version which is posted on www.springerlink.com for the purpose of self-archiving or deposit. Furthermore, the author may only post his/her version provided acknowledgement is given to the original source of publication and a link is inserted to the published article on Springer's website. The link must be accompanied by the following text: “The original publication is available at www.springerlink.com”.</em></em></blockquote><h3 id="nature-publishing-group"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html">Nature Publishing Group</a></h3><blockquote><em><em>When a manuscript is accepted for publication in an NPG journal, authors are encouraged to submit the author's version of the accepted paper (the unedited manuscript) to PubMedCentral or other appropriate funding body's archive, for public release six months after publication. In addition, authors are encouraged to archive this version of the manuscript in their institution's repositories and, if they wish, on their personal websites, also six months after the original publication. In all these cases, authors should cite the publication reference and DOI number on any deposited version, and provide a link from it to the URL of the published article on the journal's website.</em></em></blockquote><p>The policies of some of the smaller publishers can be more difficult to find. Sometimes an email exchange with the publisher will be necessary.</p><h3 id="many-universities-have-institutional-repositories">Many universities have institutional repositories</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.opendoar.org/">OpenDOAR</a> is a directory of open access repositories. My university doesn't yet have an institutional repository. After a short email exchange they offered to host my post-prints on a public webserver. I currently have no details on the software platform used or how many people in my university use this service.</p><h3 id="post-prints-may-no-longer-be-available">Post-prints may no longer be available</h3><p>Most publishers don't allow posting of the journal PDF. You have to post the final manuscript after per-review (post-print). The problem: I no longer have these manuscripts for papers published more than a few years ago – thinking that the PDF would be enough.</p><h3 id="your-post-prints-are-hard-to-find">Your post-prints are hard to find</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.opendoar.org/search.php">OpenDOAR</a> has a search function, but searching several institutional repositories at once is complicated. Your best bet is probably to find a paper in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.pubmed.gov/">Pubmed</a> and then try to find the institutional repository for that author. But maybe you have to check several institutional repositories if the authors are not all from the same institution.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>Posting your paper in an institutional repository can be a challenging project. It is therefore advisable to think about this before paper submission. What is your publication strategy? Do you need open access? Does the journal offer free content after an embargo period of 6 or 12 months? What is the journal policy regarding post-prints? And most importantly, keep the manuscript version right after peer-review. A central repository such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">Pubmed Central</a> doesn't have most of these shortcomings.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The legal disputes following the withdrawal from the market of two drugs for the treatment of pain (the COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and valdecoxib) have led to another critical examination of the paper publishing process. I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/02/23/should-peer-review-be-confidential">written</a> in February about the drug company Pfizer trying to obtain confidential peer review documents from the journals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://jama.ama-assn.org/">JAMA</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://www.nejm.org/">NEJM</a>. Courts in Chicago and Boston have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/401/1">denied</a> such requests.</p><p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/15/1800">article</a> and accompanying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/15/1833">editorial</a> in this week's JAMA look at guest authorship and ghostwriting in publications related to rofecoxib (better known as Vioxx, produced by Merck). Guest authorship was defined as an author that does not meet authorship criteria. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://www.icmje.org/">Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts to Biomedical Journals</a> from the International Commitee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) define authorship as follows:</p><blockquote><em><em>Authorship credit should be based on </em></em><br><em><em>1) substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; </em></em><br><em><em>2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and </em></em><br><em><em>3) final approval of the version to be published. </em></em><br><em><em>Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.</em></em></blockquote><p>Ghostwriting was defined as the failure to designate an individual that made significant contributions to the research or writing of a manuscript.</p><p>The JAMA <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.299.15.1800">article</a> did a systematic analysis of the court documents obtained during litigation related to rofecoxib. Guest authorship was identified in 16% of research articles and 26% of review articles; ghostwriting was identified in 13% of research articles and 10% of review articles. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/15/1833">editorial</a> in the same issue is called <em><em>Impugning the Integrity of Medical Science: The Adverse Effects of Industry Influence</em></em> and dicusses this article as well an another article called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/15/1813">Reporting Mortality Findings in Trials of Rofecoxib for Alzheimer Disease or Cognitive Impairment</a> in the same issue. The editorial proposes that drastic action is necessary and includes a list of 11 measures.</p><p>Criteria for authorship and disclosure of financial interests are clearly defined not only by the ICMJE, but also by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.41015.x">World Association of Medical Editors</a> (WAME) and by most journals. And the European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) has published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://www.emwa.org/Mum/EMWAguidelines.pdf">guidelines</a> on the role of medical writers in peer-reviewed publications. As medical writers usually don't fulfill the authorship criteria defined above (with the possible exception of review articles), they should rather be acknowledged. The EMWA guidelines propose the following wording:</p><blockquote><em><em>We thank Dr Jane Doe who provided medical writing services on behalf of XYZ Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</em></em></blockquote><p>The rules are clear and it is also clear that there will be violations of these rules. Guest authorship and ghostwriting are probably common practices, not only in publications supported by drug companies. Typical examples would be the inclusion of the department head that did little more than to provide financial support or the exclusion of the technician that did critical experiments but is not acknowledged. Cases of suspected guest authorship or ghostwriting should be taken seriously and the papers in JAMA will ignite a renewed discussion on these topics.</p><p>For different views on this topic, look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://blogs.nature.com/nm/spoonful/2008/04/exit_ghost.html">Exit ghost</a> by Juan Carlos Lopez over at <em><em>Spoonful of Medicine</em></em> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111125/http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2008/04/18/cut_it_out_cut_it_out_now.php">Cut it out.

I would like to highlight some of the discussions we had here on Nature Network.</p><p>Bob O'Hara wonders about the cost of publishing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110656/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/boboh/2008/04/09/open-access-show-us-the-money">Open Access: Show us the Money!</a>. He argues that shifting the costs from reader to author can create problems. Most authors, especially those with limited resources, would be reluctant to pay submision fees if they can also submit to a journal without those fees. But the reader-pays model could give authors more bargaining power with journals.

Open Access and this new policy are complicated topics that simply can't be covered in a single blog post. This week will certainly see a lot of discussion on this topic, both on Nature Network and elsewhere.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Erythropoietin is an effective drug to increase your number of red blood cells. It is primarily used in anemic patients with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/132">cancer</a> and on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/anemia/">dialysis</a>, but it is also popular with athletes that want to (illegally) increase their endurance performance, most notably cyclists and cross country skiers.</p><p>Although the typical work of a scientist is a very different from a cyclist performing in the Tour de France, a first case of erythropoietin use(or rather misuse) has now been reported in Germany. A neurobiology postdoc working on the role of erythropoietin in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17483696">Alzheimer disease</a> has apparently had the idea to do a little self-experimenting – probably thinking of the famous experiment by Barry Marshall that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-lecture.pdf">won him</a> a Nobel Price. Or he was pictured – during his long experiments lasting well into the night – the famous German cross country skier Johann Mühlegg who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/winter02/xcountry/news?id=1339831">tried to win</a> an Olympic Gold medal in Salt Lake City with the help of darbepoetin. What he didn't think of was the price of erythropoietin. After burning some 20.000 Euro, the technician and then the principal investigator became suspicious. The case is now under investigation by the university and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://www.dfg.de/">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a>. What the authorities don't know is how to handle this case. Is this simply misappropriation of the research funds, is this brain doping, or is this a misunderstood brilliant scientist? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://www.wabda.org/">World Anti-Brain Doping Authority</a> now got involved to help clear the issues.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anna's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090300/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/U2929A0EA/2008/03/22/i-am-not-yelling-not-out-loud">recent post</a> about her struggles with Pubmed searches reminded me that there is still a lot that could and should be done to improve the paper (or thesis) writing process. This is my personal list of major annoyances:</p><ul><li><strong>Pubmed</strong>. This topic has been extensively covered in Anna's post.</li><li><strong>Bibliographies</strong>. The process from finding a paper in Pubmed to storing it into your bibliographic software to downloading and storing the PDF to creating a bibliography in a paper is extremely complicated. In my case this process involves a web browser, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090300/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090300/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a>, a PDF viewer and Microsoft Word.</li><li><strong>Writing a paper</strong>. The idiosyncrasies of Microsoft Word (the tool probably used by most people for paper writing) would make for a different blog post. Microsoft Word can do many things that are never needed in a scientific manuscript, but lacks features that are important. And it likes to crash on long texts.</li><li><strong>Collective Writing</strong>. The process of having several people working on a manuscript and managing different versions is overly complicated.</li><li><strong>Paper submission</strong>. The online tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090300/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/home.htm">Editorial Manager</a> are nice, but there is still too much formatting work required (in a format that is probably different depending on the journal).</li></ul><p>Interestingly, the way we do paper writing and paper submission has changed a lot between ca. 1985 and 1995. Basically the transition from analog to digital. Who still remembers Index Medicus, Current Contents, copying papers in the library, Letraset for figure numbering, mailing hard copies of manuscripts around, etc.?</p><p>But what has changed in the last 10-15 years? Probably not that much. Web 2.0 is an overused term, but there is so much potential for improvement in the area of manuscript writing. We should <em><em>not</em></em> be satisfied with what Pubmed, Endnote, Microsoft Word, etc. offer today. That is why I don't understand some of the discussion surrounding Anna's blog post, basically advising her to just sit down and learn her Pubmed stuff.</p><p>If that is not enough for you, some people have already taken the next step: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090300/http://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/jchla/jchla29/c07-035.pdf">Web 3.0 and health librarians: an introduction</a>.</p>]]></content>

Thanks to the O'Reilly Group on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> (that other social network), I received a review copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515164/index.html">Wikipedia: The Missing Manual</a>. But why would a scientist want to know how to write and edit articles on Wikipedia?</p><p>Wikipedia has become a respectable source of information that rivals the more traditional encylopedias such as the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Remember the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html">December 2005 Nature study</a> that compared the two? Wikipedia has accurate information even on such obscure topics as dwarf <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mammuthus_primigenius">woolly mammoths</a> from Wrangel Island.</p><p>But we all know that Wikipedia is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7111/full/443493a.html">not perfect</a>. If we want to improve the information on topics we care about – and probably have spent years working on – we could become a Wikipedia editor. Especially if we are interested in an audience that includes not only fellow scientists, but also people from other scientific disciplines, journalists or students.</p><p>Writing and editing content on Wikipedia is a complicated process. Because anyone can edit content, a great number of rules exist to make sure that the articles have correct information, don't violate privacy, aren't misused as marketing opportunity, etc. All these rules, as well as many practical tips and other tools are of course available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents">online</a>. But <em><em>Wikipedia: The Missing Manual</em></em> is a very good text for the aspiring new Wikipedia editor that wants a more systematic introduction.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>David Crotty, the Executive Editor from CSH Protocols, last month wrote a provocative blog post called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.cshblogs.org/cshprotocols/2008/02/14/why-web-20-is-failing-in-biology/">Why Web 2.0 is failing in Biology</a>. He did an informal poll among scientists and found that none of them read science blogs or use social networking sites for scientists. His arguments why that is so?</p><ul><li><em><em>Time</em></em>. Scientists have little time, and rather spend this time in the laboratory or reading papers</li><li><em><em>Trust</em></em>. Web 2.0 sites for scientists haven't (yet) build a reputation. For important decisions (e.g. a critical protocol for an experiment), they rather ask a colleague they know.</li><li><em><em>Inappropriate Tools</em></em>. The requirements for scientists are very different from the typical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> user.</li></ul><p>I believe that David is right in his analysis that the big majority of scientists (at least in the life sciences) don't read science blogs or participate in social networking sites like <em><em>Nature Network</em></em>. This could mean two things: a) Web 2.0 is not working for biologists or b) we are just at the beginning and need to be patient. As a science blogger I like to believe in b). Fortunately or unfortunately, the success of any Web 2.0 project depends on a large number of users.</p><p>As of 2008, I think that Science 2.0 (or whatever you want to call it) has had a good start. But it is very important that we stay focused on where we want to go and not get distracted by the possibilities that the technology offers. One goal I've set for myself and have written about in this blog: Web 2.0 should make the process of paper writing much easier. This includes easy access to papers needed for your manuscript (including open access), online writing tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.buzzword.com/">Buzzword</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>, online tools for managing or sharing your references (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.refworks.com/">Refworks</a>) and tools for collaboration and coordination (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>). Right now, the different pieces don't quite fit together, but the potential is there for tremendous savings of time and money. And that is attractive.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have finished all the experiments and are in the middle of writing that wonderful manuscript that will change not only the field you are working in but also your personal career. But then you encounter all these complicated issues related to paper writing, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/maxine/2008/02/08/duplicate-publication-7-february-2008">duplicate publications</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://network.nature.com/forums/askthenatureeditor/788">joint first authors</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/rafaerts/2008/02/25/multi-authored-papers-i-thought-20-authors-was-a-lot">multi-authored papers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://network.nature.com/forums/neuroscience/1170">paper rejections</a>.</p><p>You understand that these are sensitive ethical issues and you want to do the right thing. When is joint first authorship a problem, can I publish a paper a second time if it is written in another language, should my department head be a coauthor, etc. You will of course discuss these questions with your coauthors, but where else can you look for advice?</p><ul><li><em><em>Journal author guidelines.</em></em> The first and most useful place to look for advice, both for technical aspects, but also for ethical issues surrounding your manuscript. Author guidelines probably often are read too late (days before submission) and not carefully enough. The Editorial policies of <em><em>Nature</em></em> are found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/index.html">here</a>.</li><li><em><em>ICMJE (International Commitee of Medical Journal Editors)</em></em>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.icmje.org/index.html">Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals</a> could be the next place for advice. The text contains a lot of useful information for both authors and editors, including special reporting guidelines such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.consort-statement.org/index.aspx?o=1011">CONSORT</a> for randomized controlled trials.</li><li><em><em>COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics)</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/">COPE</a> is another useful resource that I recently discovered. I especially like the Case section, where real-life examples such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/cases/zeroseventwo">ghost authorship</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/cases/onethreetwo">reviewer competing interests</a> are discussed.</li></ul><p>If there are still open questions after reading these guidelines, join the regular discussion in the Nature Network blogs and forums on these topics, most recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://network.nature.com/forums/neuroscience/1170">Nobel prize-winning lab retracts paper from Nature</a> in th</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612091432/http://www.worldbookday.com/">World Book Day</a>, at least in the United Kingdom. So I wanted to join my fellow NN Bloggers in our newest <em><em>SynchroBlogging</em></em> effort and wrote this post about science and books. I decided to write about the last book I bought – which was yesterday.</p><p>The book is in German and is called <em><em>Italien – Kurzes Reisehandbuch von Karl Baedeker</em></em>. The Baedeker series of travel guides (this one is about Italy) is still popular, but was started around 150 years ago. My book is the third edition and was printed in 1895. I will be traveling to the Amalfi Coast near Naples for my Easter holiday and I thought this would be a good opportunity to do some experimental tourism.</p><p><a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/experimentaltravel/">Experimental Travel</a> is a playful new way of traveling that I learned about exactly one year ago on March 6 (another good reason for this post) when I bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612091432/http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/product_detail.cfm?productID=2738">this</a> book in a bookstore in Auckland on my first vacation day in New Zealand. The books describes many travel experiments and laboratory results, including</p><ul><li><em><em>Airport tourism</em></em>. Spend 24 hours in an airport without getting on a plane</li><li><em><em>Confluence seeking</em></em>. Visit ordered points such as exactly 35° S / 117° E using a GPS device</li><li><em><em>Mascot travel</em></em>. Take pictures of your mascot outside famous landmarks, made famous by the French movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612091432/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/244109/Am-lie/overview">Amelie</a>.</li></ul><p>The experiment I wanted to do since reading this book was historic travel, i.e. traveling with the help of a guidebook from a different time. Italy is perfect for that, because my 1895 guidebook can still be very useful for many places I will be visiting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612091432/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompei">Pompei</a> is a good example. I will try to write lab notes and report on the outcome of the experiment.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2008-03-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Posters are an important tool to communicate your research findings to a larger audience. The format is different from oral presentations or full papers, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094621/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030102">special rules</a> for a good poster apply. Posters can be an important step before a full publication, although many posters will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094621/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;uid=17296415">never</a> be peer-reviewed and published.</p><p>The problem with posters is that they are second class citizens to oral presentations in most meetings. My personal experience with posters, both my own work and posters from others, has been mixed. In some meetings the poster presentation was a relaxed event (including beer and brezels in the last meeting) with good discussions in front of the poster, but often the poster presentation is not much more than a trick to increase conference attendance.</p><p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094621/http://www.aerzteblatt-international.de/int/article.asp?src=search&amp;id=58801">recent paper</a> (link to english version) in the German journal <em><em>Deutsches </em>Ä<em>rzteblatt</em></em> systematically interviewed poster authors and attendees at a German meeting. This meeting used the format of a moderated poster presentation. The attendance in the poster presentations was very low, but was valued by younger scientists and by the moderators. One third of the posters had already been presented at another meeting, an issues that touches the problem of duplicate papers that we recently discussed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094621/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/954">here</a> on Nature Network. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094621/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;uid=17296415">another study</a>, 12% of the posters had already been published as full paper at the time of the meeting.</p><p>In my opinion poster presentations are an important part of every scientific meeting. They should be taken seriously by using a competitive peer review process, including the rejection of abstracts that have already been presented or published. And they should be allowed enough space and time in the meeting schedule. Maybe we could also come up with new formats (e.g. this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094621/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18246386">video in poster</a>) that make the poster presentation both fun and scientifically engaging.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Donald Kennedy, the edior-in-chief of Science, yesterday wrote an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110359/http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/319/5866/1009">editorial</a> about a legal dispute between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110359/http://www.nejm.org/">New England Journal of Medicine</a> and the drug company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110359/http://www.pfizer.com/">Pfizer</a>. Pfizer wants the NEJM to provide the reviewer comments on submitted papers about the two Pfizer products celecoxib (Celebrex) and valdecoxib (Bextra). Both drugs are used to treat pain and belong to the COX-2 inhibitor class of drugs. Rofecoxib (Vioxx) is another COX-2 inhibitor produced by Merck. Rofecoxib and valdecoxib, but not celecoxib were withdrawn from the market about three years ago because of an increased risk of cardiovascular side effects, including heart attacks.</p><p>Research findings about cardiovascular side effects of COX-2 inhibitors are at the center of the dispute and Pfizer is now seeking arguments for their case not just from published papers but also in confidential peer reviews and manuscripts that were rejected. This legal dispute is important because it touches central aspects of the peer review process.</p><p>The findings of scientific papers can have consequences not only to the scientific community involved, but also for the personal fortunes of their authors (e.g. new jobs or grants), the treatment of patients, our policies towards climate change – or the profit of a drug company. With that much at stake, the temptation to move the scientific argument from the editorial office to the courtroom is there. We should resist this temptation, or the peer review process and the way we communicate science will never be the same again.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons to list all your publications online. Maybe you are looking for a new job or want to attract students to start their PhD in your lab. Usually you find this information on the home page of your laboratory or department, but several tools can automate this process.</p><h3 id="nature-network">Nature Network</h3><p>You can list your publications in your Nature Network profile. Simply add the DOI or Pubmed ID in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://network.nature.com/publications/new">form</a> provided. (Some of) my publications are listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://network.nature.com/profile/mfenner/publications">here</a>.</p><h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> has a similar feature for those unfortunate souls not yet on Nature Network. Use the Facebook application <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://apps.facebook.com/medlinepublications/">Medline Publications</a>.</p><h3 id="google-scholar">Google Scholar</h3><p>Only Facebook members can see your Medline publications. But everybody can use Google Scholar. My publications are listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;q=autor%3A%22mh+fenner%22">here</a>.</p><h3 id="pubmed">Pubmed</h3><p>Why not use the original? Use the search term “Fenner MH”[Author]. My publications are listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Search&amp;Term=%22Fenner%20MH%22%5BAuthor%5D">here</a>.</p><h3 id="scopus">Scopus</h3><p>Searches in Google Scholar and Pubmed search by name. This means that the links above don't work if your name is not unique. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a> uses a unique author ID to overcome these problems. My author ID: 7006600833 and 7006600825. If you have more than one author ID (as in my case), you can ask Scopus to merge them together into one author ID. Scopus also provides an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://searchapidocs.scopus.com/">API</a> to create mashups with other data. One example is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://info.scopus.com/scsearchapi/geoCitations/index.html">this</a> mashup with Google Maps that shows a map of the most highly cited papers by subject area. The problem with Scopus? You have to sign up for a user account to use Scopus.</p><h3 id="researcherid">ResearcherID</h3><p>The new kid on the block. ResearcherID is currently only available to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://isiwebofknowledge.com/">ISI Web of Knowledge</a> users, for all others it is invitation only. But everybody can access your publications. My researcherID is A-7225-2008 and the list of my publications can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.researcherid.com:80/rid/A-7225-2008">here</a>.</p><p>The problem with ResearcherID? ResearcherID is tightly integrated with other Thomson Scientific products. You need a ISI Web of Knowledge account to add papers, Or you can import your citations from a RIS file, a file format from the Thomson Scientific <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.refman.com/">Reference Manager</a>.</p><p>As you can see, all these tools have their shortcomings. Pubmed and Google Scholar fall short, because searching by name just doesn't work. Scopus and ResearcherID are nice and provide additional features, e.g. the Hirsch number or citations of your papers. But the commercial interests of Elsevier and Thomson Scientific have introduced important limitations.</p><p>So for the time being, the best tool is <em><em>Nature Network</em></em>. And there is great potential for improvements, e.g. integration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a> or linking to coauthors that are also Nature Network members.</p><p>In related news, Ian Mulvany today announced on his Nature Network blog that Connotea is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/U3DF456C6/2008/02/22/connotea-is-now-openid-enabled">OpenID enabled</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2008-02-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Nature News article last week talked about the confusion that happens if a number of authors have the same or similar names (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080213/full/451766a.html">Scientific publishing: Identity crisis</a>). This is apparently a special issue in China because of the difficulties transliterating Chinese characters into English and the use of only a limited number of surnames. The Nature Nanotechnology – Asia Pacific and Beyond Forum has a discussion about this topic (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://network.nature.com/forums/nnano/939">What's in an Asian name?</a>).</p><p>The difficulties for German authors are much smaller, and this is probably true for other European languages. We do have a fair number of surnames, but umlauts in our names (e.g. in the very popular last name Müller) are frequently lost. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://network.nature.com/profile/cesarsanchez">Cesar Sanchez</a> pointed out in the Nature Nanotechnology discussion mentioned above, Pubmed started using diacritics, including umlauts, last year (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/nd07/nd07_diacritics.html">Diacritics in PubMed Displays and Searching</a>). And the American Physical Society started to allow Chinese, Japanese and Korean authors to use names in their own language (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://pra.aps.org/PhysRevLett.99.230001">Editorial: Which Wei Wang?</a>).</p><p>But the problem is the same. There are at least 6 different <em><em>M. Fenner</em></em> in the MEDLINE database, one of them my cousin. Using the middle initial can help. I try to publish as <em><em>MH Fenner</em></em>, and very smart people will figure out that papers written by <em><em>H Fenner</em></em> are from my father. And what happens when you marry? My wife and I have different last names (which is uncommon in Germany) and one small reason was the scientific track record (including publications) connected to this name. Some of the other issues are nicely summarized in a PLOS post by Richard Cave (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://www.plos.org/cms/node/133">Unique Author Identification</a>, thanks Cesar Sanchez).</p><p>The solution? We need unique identifiers for authors. I recently wrote about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/01/21/thomson-scientific-launches-researcherid-to-uniquely-identify-authors">ResearcherID</a>, one such effort announced this January by Thomson Scientific. The problem with ResearcherID is that author identity is a very sensitive issue and many people will be reluctant to rely on a private company for that. Elsevier is doing something similar in their Scopus database (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://info.scopus.com/etc/authoridentifier/">The Scopus Author Identifier</a>).</p><p>Author identifiers should really come from a neutral organization such as CrossRef (a publishing organization that brought us the DOI to uniquely identify a scientific paper). They held a meeting with various interested parties in February 2007 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2007/02/crossref_author_id_meeting.html">CrossRef Author ID meeting</a>). Because of the number of parties involved and the different issues, this is a very slow process. And what is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110744/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/">U.S. Library of Medicine</a> doing on this issue? After all, they publish MEDLINE, the most important database of biomedical research.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nature Network turns one year old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2008/02/happy_birthday_nature_network.html">today</a> and it's time to celebrate. We already have a number of interesting – and entertaining – birthday celebrations. I want to contribute with my personal experience at Nature Network.</p><p>During the day I treat cancer patients and do cancer research at a German University hospital. But I have been interested in programming for many years, first with the Applescript language (I was involved with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://www.macscripter.net/">Macscripter</a> website) and more recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. Open sharing of resources and information using blogs and other tools is common in these communities.</p><p>I joined Nature Network last August. In May I had started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://blog.xartrials.com/">science blog</a> on my on server, more as a personal experiment than a serious blogging effort. The inspiration came from an article by Laura Bonetta published in Cell entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://www.cell.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0092867407005430">Scientists enter the blogosphere</a>. Moving to Nature Network gave me a much wider audience, but also meant a commitment to a more serious blogging effort.</p><p>The topics I pick for my blog mostly relate to how the internet has changed the way we publish our scientific work. Writing regular blog posts about these topics has forced me to do a lot of background research and I have probably learned more than I would have by just reading papers and other people's blog posts or comments.</p><p>In the early 1990s, when Internet use was mostly by dialup and could cost $10 per hour, I was involved with the Compuserve network.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cancer is caused by genetic changes<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110843/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/02/07/using_rna_interference_to_identify_genes_that_protect_from_cancer/#fn1">1</a></sup>. Oncogenes harbor activating mutations that cause or promote cancer, whereas tumor suppressor genes<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110843/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/02/07/using_rna_interference_to_identify_genes_that_protect_from_cancer/#fn2">2</a></sup> protect from cancer. In this model, genetic changes in one copy of an oncogene, but both copies of a tumor suppressor gene are required to initiate cancer. This simple model is complicated by the fact that more than one genetic change is usually required to initiate cancer, and that other so called epigenetic changes (such as promoter hypermethylation) are also important.</p><p>Myelodysplastic syndromes are malignant disorders of the bone marrow that show insufficient production of blood cells and harbor the risk of progressing to acute myeloid leukemia. The 5q syndrome is a distinct subtype that is characterized by loss of genetic material at chromosome 5q31, a characteristic morphology of the bone marrow, and a fairly benign clinical course. We would expect to find a tumor suppressor gene in the deleted region on chromosome 5, but no genetic changes on the other allele of chromosome 5 could be detected. The traditional strategies to identify the genetic changes responsible for the 5q syndrome therefore didn't work.</p><p>Research by Benjamin Ebert et al. presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December and now published in Nature<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110843/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/02/07/using_rna_interference_to_identify_genes_that_protect_from_cancer/#fn3">3</a></sup> claims to have finally identified the genetic change responsible for 5q syndrome. They used RNA interference to in turn knock out each of the 40 genes in the common deleted region on chromosome 5q31. They observed the phenotype of human hematopoetic progenitor cells transfected with short hairpin RNAs. The shRNA targeting the gene RPS14 recapitulated the phenotype of patients with 5q syndrome.</p><p>To confirm the role of RPS14 in 5q syndrome, RPS14 was overexpressed in hematopoetic cells from patients with 5q syndrome and indeed reverted the erythroid differentiation effect. Reduced expression or inactivating mutations of the one remaining RPS14 gene in 5q syndrome patients was ruled out by sequencing and gene expression profiling.</p><p>Further evidence for the importance of RPS14 in 5q syndrome comes from studies of related genes. Expression of RPS14 is required for proper function of the 40s ribosomal subunit. Germline mutations of two other ribosomal proteins, RPS19 and RPS24, have been identified in the congenital disorder Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the disease in these children has similar features.</p><p>As a medical student, I was fortunate enough to listen to Alfred Knudson give a talk about is two-hit hypothesis of tumor suppressor genes<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110843/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/02/07/using_rna_interference_to_identify_genes_that_protect_from_cancer/#fn2">2</a></sup>, and I was fascinated by cancer genetics ever since. Genetics continues to be a driving force in our understanding of cancer. The next big step in the 5q syndrome story will be a better understanding of why the drug lenalidomide works so well in this disease, and how this relates to RPS14 function.

Just Science 2008 will start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110608/http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2008/01/just_science_announcement.php">tomorrow</a> and ends February 8. Science bloggers that agree to participate should write one daily blog entry for these five days. The blog entries should talk about science, and not about topic related to science (e.g. open access). Interested readers can subscribe to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110608/http://www.justscience.net/2008/?feed=rss2">RSS Feed</a> and will automatically receive all blog posts.</p><p>The recently launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110608/http://www.researchblogging.org/">Research Blogging</a> is a related effort to aggregate blog posts about science.</p><p>Like many other science bloggers, I do not write directly about science, but rather about issues that are important for scientists. I have so far been reluctant to blog about science. Why is that? Jon Udell two weeks ago wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110608/http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/01/22/bloggers-talk-to-bloggers-scientists-talk-to-scientists/">blog post</a> where he observes that bloggers talk to bloggers and scientists talk to scientists. I agree with him that we need better tools to integrate scientific publishing and the blogosphere.</p><p>But more importantly, many Scientists (including myself) are still reluctant to talk about their science in the blogosphere. This is understandable if you have unpublished results, half-baked ideas, etc that are not yet ready to be shared with the scientific community. But non-scientists usually don't read the scientific literature, as most papers are difficult to impossible to understand – and access to scientific literature can be expensive. We shouldn't forget to communicate our research to the community. If we don't do that, we shouldn't be surprised if the traditional media either don't report our research at all, or give a distorted view that we are not happy with.</p><p>Having said that, I don't have have any immediate plans to blog about science. My area of expertise is cancer research, and talking about cancer research is even more complicated because of often unrealistic expectations that these findings quickly translate into new treatment options for patients.</p>]]></content>

In this report Mounir Errami and Harold Garner estimate that there as many as 200.000 duplicate papers in Medline or 1% of all published papers.</p><p>The article has already been widely cited, including of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080123/full/news.2008.520.html">Nature News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/954">Nature Network</a>, but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/221820549/something-rotten-in-the-state-of-scientific-publishing">Noble Intent</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DigitalKoans/~3/222411428/">DigitalKoans</a>.</p><p>The original paper by Errami and Garner was published in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/243"><em>Bioinformatics</em></a>. They used the search engine eTBLAST to find duplicate papers and deposited the results in a database called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/">Deja Vu</a>. When you search Deja Vu for scientists you know, you find scary results.</p><p>Nobody likes duplicate papers, but it's just another trick to improve your publication record. Another popular trick is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n11/full/7401095.html">inflation</a> of paper authors. But the basic trick is still the heavy use of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://chronicle.com/jobs/2004/02/2004020901c.htm">least publishable unit</a> or LPU.</p><p>Both authors and journals are inclined to publish as many papers as possible. So what will change these practices? If the quality of the work of a scientist isn't simply measured by numerical indices such as number of publications. So it's up to those that decide about grants and jobs to find a better way to pick up the best scientists.</p><p>Corie Lok has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/954">started</a> a discussion about this topic in the <em><em>Publishing in the New Millenium Forum</em></em>, please post your comments there.</p>]]></content>

But when you are about to submit your paper and don't want to take any chances – especially when English is not your first language – a scientific writer can be helpful. You can pay someone to do this, but even better would be a scientific writer that is employed by your university or research organization (I've written about this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092138/http://network.nature.com/topics/show/567?page=2">before</a>).</p><p>Not many institutions in Germany have the resources (or vision) to hire such a person.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thomson Scientific last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092246/http://scientific.thomson.com/press/2008/8429910/">announced</a> <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em>. ResearcherID tries to solve a problem that has annoyed me for many years. In contrast to papers and journals, authors are not associated with a unique ID in databases such as PubMed. You are lucky if you have an uncommon last name that contains only letters from the English alphabet. For the rest of us, a typical PubMed search for your name will also pick up papers by other authors. In my case for example papers by my cousin Mathias Fenner.</p><p>The missing unique ID for authors makes it impossible to automate the creation of publication lists for authors or insitutions. You already can get email alerts or RSS feeds of papers published by a specific person (colleague or competitor), but without unique ID, this is tricky. ResearcherID will also automate the maintenance of your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092246/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/17/do-you-know-your-hirsch-number">Hirsch number</a> (for those interested in this kind of metric).</p><p>Scientists interested in ResearcherID should register at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092246/http://www.researcherid.com/">reseacherID.com</a> website. Registration is currently by invitation only.</p><p>There is one major problem with ResearcherID. It is not clear from the press release of who owns and controls this information. This is a very sensitive issue and Thomson Scientific a major player in this field. Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092246/http://www.passport.net/">Microsoft Passport</a>? The majority of web users was uncomfortable having a central user ID and password managed by Microsoft. The service eventually failed, and we now have the open standard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092246/http://openid.net/">Open ID</a>. Similarly, ResearcherID can only work if the user database is either shared openly or hosted by someone like the NIH.</p>]]></content>

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a> is a wonderful new subnotebook perfect for successful scientists with many talks to give and enough money to spend.</p><p>But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/Office2008/default.mspx">Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac</a> is probably the most important new product from a scientists perspective. If you live in the U.S., you can buy Office right now, us international users will have to wait a few weeks. Office 2008 runs natively (i.e. much faster) on Intel Macs, so everybody with those newer Macs wants to upgrade for that reason alone. Powerpoint and Excel are important, but Microsoft Word is the application I use most of the time.</p><p>Microsoft Word 2008 has a new feature called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/11/14/road_to_mac_office_2008_word_08_vs_pages_3_0.html&amp;page=3">citations</a>, basically a simple reference manager. This feature first appeared in Office 2007 for Windows. Citations integrates nicely with your Word document, but can't handle the more sophisticated needs of a research paper, e.g. automatic importing form online databases and dozens of reference styles for all the journals you possibly want to submit to.</p><p>Unfortunately you can't use the current version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> with Microsoft Word 2008. Thomson Scientific (the Endnote publisher) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.endnote.com/support/en_wpchart_mac.asp">working</a> on a version for Microsoft Word 2008. The update is made more difficult by the fact that support for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was dropped in Office 2008. The alternative reference managers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.sonnysoftware.com/">Bookends</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/">Sente</a> also currently don't work with Microsoft Word 2008.</p><p>Microsoft Word 2008 by default uses the new XML-based .docx format introduced in Office 2007 for Windows. This format was originally not supported by Nature, Science and other STM publishers (read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2007/06/word_2007_and_the_stm_publishe.html">this</a> Nascent post for the reasons behind it). Nature is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/submissions/template/index.html">now able to accept</a> Word 2007 (and Word 2008) files, but this might not necessarily be true for other publishers.</p>]]></content>

This should lead to more citations of journal articles, resulting in a better Impact Factor and reputation of the journal.</p><p>100 years ago, German was an important scientific language, but now only 2% of journals indexed in Medline are in German. I personally haven't written a scientific paper in German for many years. I sometimes regret that I can't use German (or French or Italian for that matter) to report by findings or express my ideas.

In this article he talks about the increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies in research. The largest part of the article is about Open Notebook Science and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092539/http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenWetWare</a> in particular. But he also talks about science blogs and other Web 2.0 efforts such as Nature Network, which is mentioned briefly at the end of the article.</p><p>The draft article was posted online last week. In true Web 2.0 spirit, M. Mitchell Waldrop has invited readers to post comments and promised that he will use them for the final print version. I wrote a comment and suggested that the increasing role of Web 2.0 companies such as Google, Microsoft and Adobe in the online creation and distribution of science should be mentioned in the article.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm a regular reader of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>, a popular blog about internet products and companies. But somehow I missed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/22/2007-in-numbers-igoogle-googles-homegrown-star-performer-this-year/">article</a> just before christmas that talks about the popularity of different Google products. In this analysis, traffic for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> was down 32% compared to 2006.</p><p>I haven't seen this information reproduced somewhere else, but the number for most of the other Google products were higher than 2006, as expected. And I don't have the numbers of searches in Google Scholar compared to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez">PubMed</a> (you would have to buy this information from companies like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.comscore.com/">comScore</a>). But does this indicate that there is something wrong with Google Scholar? As a PubMed user for 15 years, I still like to get search results chronologically and not by (perceived) relevance. And I like the detailed search options and integration with other databases.</p><p>Other search engines in this field include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scirus.com/">Scirus</a> from Elsevier and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://academic.live.com/">Windows Live Academic Search</a> from Microsoft. Incidentally, TechCrunch (and others) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/08/microsoft-has-announced-a-takeover-bid-for-fast-search-transfer-priced-at-12-billion/">reports</a> this week that Microsoft is about to acquire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.fastsearch.com/">Fast Search &amp; Transfer</a>, the Norvegian company that provides the search technology to Scirus.</p><p>Some big company names, but for me Pubmed is still the first stop when searching for journal articles. And PubMed will become more important as the NIH now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law">requires</a> the deposition of all NIH-funded research papers in PubMed Central.</p>]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.front-matter.io/mfenner/tired-of-impact-factors-try-the-sjr-indicator"/>
        <updated>2008-01-07T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Picking the right journal is one of the most important decisions when you start to work on a paper. You probably have a gut feeling of the journals that are best suited for your paper in progress. To make this decision more objective, you can rely on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://scientific.thomson.com/free/essays/journalcitationreports/impactfactor/">Impact Factor</a> of a journal. The Impact Factor is roughly the average number of citations per paper in a given journal and is published by  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://scientific.thomson.com/index.html">Thomson Scientic</a>. Higher Impact Factors mean more prestigious journals. This information is also frequently used for job or grant applications.</p><p>Impact factors have been around for more than 40 years and they generally been very helpful. But there are two big problems:</p><h3 id="impact-factors-are-published-by-one-privately-owned-company">Impact Factors are published by one privately owned company</h3><p>Given the importance of Impact Factors for many aspects of scientific publishing, it would be preferable if there were alternatives. And Impact Factors are not freely available, but must be purchased from Thomson Scientific.</p><h3 id="impact-factors-might-not-be-the-best-tool-to-measure-scientific-quality">Impact Factors might not be the best tool to measure scientific quality</h3><p>Impact factors have several shortcomings. Because they are a convenient way to judge the scientific output of a person, organization, journal or country, they are often overused. They should for example not be used to compare journals in different fields, e.g. cell biology and particle physics. Measures like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/17/do-you-know-your-hirsch-number">Hirsch Number</a> might be a better tool to measure the scientific output of an individual scientist. And sometimes the judgement of your peers in the field is more important than simple numbers.</p><p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.scimagojr.com/">SCImago Journal Rank</a> indicator tries to overcome these two shortcomings. The index was created by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.scimago.es/">SCImage Research Group</a>, located at several Spanish universities. The index uses information from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a> abstract and citation database of research literature owned by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.elsevier.com/">Elsevier</a>.</p><p>In contrast to the Impact Factor, the SJR indicator measures not simply the number of citations per paper. Citations from a journal with a higher SJR indicator lead to a higher SJR indicator for the cited journal (more details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.scimagojr.com/SCImagoJournalRank.pdf">here</a>). This approach is similar to PageRank (described in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">this</a> paper), the algorithm for web searches by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page that made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.google.com/">Google</a> what it is today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.eigenfactor.org/">Eigenfactor</a> is another scientific ranking tool that uses a PageRank algorithm.</p><p>Most of the time, journals with high Impact Factors have high SJR indicators. Nature and Science are still head to head. We will find unexpected results and discrepancies between the two over time. In my field of oncology, both the Journal of the NCI and Cancer Research are ranked higher than the Journal of Clinical Oncology.</p><p>You can read more about the SJR indicator in this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910200523/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080102/full/451006a.html">Nature News article</a>.</p>]]></content>

I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091413/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/09/27/more-on-online-writing-tools-buzzword-is-different">previously</a> wrote about Buzzword and how it could be used to write a scientific paper. The first impressions were positive, so I decided to write my next paper with Buzzword. This paper has been submitted this week. What did I like and dislike about Buzzword?</p><h3 id="good">Good</h3><p>Most importantly, there is only one version of your manuscript. You and your coauthors can simultaneously work on different parts of the manuscript, the software saves all versions of the text. Buzzword is very pleasant to use, thanks to the elegant interface. Importing and exporting to Microsoft Word is possible. And Buzzword is free.</p><h3 id="bad">Bad</h3><p>Buzzword doesn't handle references. You can create footnotes, but for referencing papers, you have to use another software. That's what I did in the final stages of manuscript writing, switching to Microsoft Word and Endnote. Buzzword doesn't show you the changes between different versions of a manuscript. This makes it difficult to see the changes that your coauthors made. Because Buzzword is an online word processor, you can't use it without an internet connection. One of my coauthors had Buzzword crashing several times, probably because of a slow internet connection.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>Manuscript writing with Buzzword is fun. But without support for references and better version management, it is not ready for prime time.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We usually look forward to a well-written paper about central aspects of your research. But sometimes you are frustrated. Maybe someone has done (almost) the same experiments, but was quicker in getting the work published. Then you can at least publish your results, probably in a less prestigous journal, to confirm these findings.</p><p>But when the just published paper comes to the opposite conclusions, and has done all the right experiments, your work can become almost worthless. This just happened to me with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091452/http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v13/n12/abs/nm1672.html">paper</a> in the December issue of Nature Medicine about the role PPARgamma in osteoclastogenesis. The group of Ronald Evans used mice with a conditional knockout of PPARgamma in osteoclasts to study the role of this nuclear hormone receptor in bone diseases. Their elegant work clearly shows that PPARgamma promotes osteoclast differentiation and activation.</p><p>Unfortunately we have very different results in a tissue culture model of osteoclast differentiation, consistent with previous publications. But it is hard to argue with a mouse model. We will carefully look at the data to decide where we go from here. But for now it's just frustrating.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A recent Nature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104641/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7166/pdf/450001a.pdf">article</a>, repeated in a Nautilus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104641/http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2007/10/accountability_of_authors.html">blog post</a>, talks about author accountability. The article suggests that at least one author per collaborative group signs a statement with reference to Nature's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104641/http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/index.html">publication policies</a>. This policy would certainly help avoid <em><em>honorary authorship</em></em>, but it can be difficult to enforce in large research projects.</p><p>I would like to make another suggestion. The quality of a research paper should not only be judged by the number of citations it receives (which improves the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104641/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/17/do-you-know-your-hirsch-number">Hirsch number</a> of the author), but also by the number of authors. There are of course research projects that are only possible with large numbers of collaborators, but many biomedical papers probably only need 2-4 authors, but rather have 5-8 authors.</p><p>One good rule of thumb is a number of papers published per year. If that number is too high (e.g. more than 10), then the author has probably not contributed significantly to all those papers. Department heads often fall into this category. These rules can easily be applied when reviewing job or grant applications.</p><p>One of the most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104641/http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/163/6/716">famous examples</a> for authorship not perused is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104641/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1849809">1922 CMAJ paper</a> about the action of pancreatic extracts on blood sugar in diabetics. John MacLeod was not a coauthor, but rather thanked in the acknowledgements. As head of the department he provided mainly logistical support. He still went on to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104641/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1923/macleod-lecture.html">win</a> the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin the following year.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How could you improve your scientific writing skills? Two months ago I <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/books-about-scientific-writing">talked</a> about books. Another idea would be a scientific writing workshop. This weekend I attended such a workshop, organized by Julia Klapproth and Barry Drees from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104747/http://www.trilogywriting.com/">Trilogy Writing &amp; Consulting</a>.</p><p>The workshop was organized as a 1½ day course with many group exercises. We learned about good scientific language, tables and graphs and other typical aspects of manuscript writing. Stuff you will also find in books such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104747/http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521823234">this one</a>. But a workshop is certainly a better learning experience – and more fun.</p><p>To my surprise the most important lesson was something else. Good scientific writing always has a message, targeted towards the audience. This is probably obvious for anybody with basic experience in journalism. But it is easier said than done when the results of your experiments are complicated and not easily fit into a model. I will try much harder to keep this in mind, e.g. by making sure that the abstract and tables/figures can speak for themselves.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to rename my blog from <em><em>Publish or Perish 2.0</em></em> to <em><em>Goobledygook</em></em>. The old name explained the topics of this blog pretty well, so why the change after only 4 months of blogging on Nature Network? And there are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103739/http://www.technorati.com/blogs/tag/gobbledygook">many blogs</a> with the same name.</p><p>I simply like the new name. The word Goobledygook was invented by the U.S. congressman Maury Maverick and used in a New York Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103739/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40A10F83855157B93C3AB178ED85F408485F9">article</a> published May 21, 1944. Maury Maverick was fed up with the vague, pompous and repetitive language used in Washington at the time and invented this new word for it. He was fighting against the all too common use of Gobbledygook. The following text is from his New York Times article:</p><blockquote>Plain and simple speech appeals to everyone because it indicates clear thought and honest motives. Here is the point: anyone who is thinking clearly and honestly can express his thoughts in words which are understandable, and in very few of them. Let's write for the reader and not for ourselves.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We just had a very interesting discussion in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://network.nature.com/forums/askthenatureeditor/567">Ask the Nature Editor</a> Forum about scientific writing. Most people agreed that the quality of the writing in the end doesn't really influence the decision to accept or reject a paper. But good writing, especially in the first paragraph, certainly helps.</p><p>But what is good scientific writing? Two weeks ago I suggested a few good books on the subject in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/09/30/books-about-scientific-writing">blog post</a>. Once you have written the paper using the advice in these books, you can use a number of tools to measure the readability of your paper.</p><p><em><em>Flesch Reading Ease Score</em></em>:</p><blockquote>206.835 - 1.015 x ASL - 84.6 x ASW</blockquote><p>ASL is average sentence length and ASW is average number of syllables per word. The Flesch Reading Ease Score can be between 0 and 100, 100 being the most difficult.</p><p>The <em><em>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test</em></em> is similar, but rates the text on a U.S. school grade level. Both Flesch scores are built into recent versions of Microsoft Word or you could use the Open Source application <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://flesh.sourceforge.net/">Flesh</a>. Flesh is much easier to use than the Microsoft Word tool and will also open PDF files. Try to rewrite your manuscript if your Flesch Reading Ease Score is too low, e.g. below 30.</p><p>Readability is important not only for manuscripts. Informed consent forms for patients wishing to participate in clinical trials in Medicine are often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/348/8/721">difficult to read</a>. And a perspective article by Celeste Condit in the current <em><em>Nature Reviews Genetics</em></em> talks about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v8/n10/abs/nrg2201.html">How geneticists can help reporters to get their story right</a>. She points out the importance of readability to communicate often highly technical material to lay people.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I visited my brother-in-law in Cambridge (UK). In the Cambridge University Press bookstore I found the wonderful little book <em><em>How to Write and Illustrate a Scientific Paper</em></em> by Björn Gustavii (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101312/http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521823234">Cambridge University Press 2003</a>). On less than 150 pages B. Gustavii gives a good summary of the typical problems and their solutions. He encourages the reader to avoid unnecessary verbosity, use the active voice more often, draw less complicated charts and to be very careful with statistics.</p><p>A few years ago I bought an old copy of <em><em>Scientific Writing</em></em> by Lester S. King and Charles G. Roland (Journal of the American Medical Association 1968). King and Roland encourage the reader to avoid unnecessary verbosity and use the active voice more often (they don't talk much about graphs and statistics). Scientific writing seemed to have almost the same problems 40 years ago. This raises two interesting questions:</p><ul><li>Could the writing of the average scientific paper be improved and are we in need of these books?</li><li>Does the quality of the writing help in getting a paper accepted? In other words, should I make the effort and improve my writing skills or should I rather do experiments?</li></ul><p>Journal editors can probably better answer these questions. My guess would be that most people would answer these questions with <em><em>yes</em></em> and <em><em>no</em></em>. So we will continue to struggle with our writing skills, especially those of us who learned English as a second language, but it will not be that important in our career. I therefore rather list some other books about scientific writing that I own and can recommend:</p><ul><li><em><em>Medical Writing: a Prescription for Clarity</em></em> by Neville W. Goodman and Martin B. Edwards (Cambridge University Press 2006). Very detailed instructions about the use of the language. Includes many examples of bad scientific writing and suggestions for better alternatives.</li><li><em><em>The Elements of Style</em></em> by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White (Logman 2000). The classic text from the beginning of the 20th century, not specific to scientific writing.</li><li><em><em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em></em> by Edward R. Tufte (Graphics Press 2001). Another classic text and a beautiful book.</li><li><em><em>Clinical Epidemiology</em></em> by R. Brian Haynes, David L. Sackett, Gordon H. Guyatt and Peter Tugwell (Lippincott 2006). This epidemiology/statistics textbook has a small chapter about scientific writing. More importantly, it is very helpful in how to read a scientific paper and the statistics behind it.</li></ul><p>And I finish with an example for good scientific writing that is used a lot in the books mentioned above:</p><blockquote>We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.). This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest…</blockquote><p>This is of course the opening paragraph of the 1953 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101312/http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf">Nature paper</a> by Watson and Crick. Which brings us back to Cambridge…</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2007-09-30T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month I attended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsConf Europe</a> in Berlin. RailsConf is a conference about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, a programming framework to produce websites. I'm a part-time Ruby on Rails programmer and had a very interesting conference. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2007/09/a-railsconf-europe-07-diary.html">Others</a> have already written about RailsConf, so I want to focus on how it was like from a scientist's perspective.</p><p>The topic was of course very different from say a meeting about RNA interference, but many things were surprisingly similar. But I found a few differences very interesting, and I believe a scientific meeting could learn from them.</p><p>Many of the talks were about ongoing work that hasn't been finished yet. Ruby on Rails is Open Source software, so there is less worry about intellectual property and people talked freely about their ideas and problems. This is in contrast to the typical meeting in my field (oncology), where only the most established researchers are not afraid to present data that have not yet been published or at least submitted. This of course brings us back to the Open Science discussion both on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://network.nature.com/boston/news/blog/U66E7CD1A/2007/08/09/scifoo-ponderings-how-to-break-the-mold-in-science">Nature Network</a> and elsewhere.</p><p>Partly because of this openness, but also because it was a technology meeting, the conference is much more accessible for those that couldn't make it to Berlin. Not only are the slides of most presentations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://www.railsconfeurope.com/pub/w/61/presentations.html">available for download</a>, but there are also numerous blog posts. We'll soon also see podcasts and videocasts (the keynote lecture is already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://www.rubyinside.com/dhhs-keynote-at-railsconf-europe-2007-611.html">available</a>). I'm a big podcast fan and I would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/6/6/asco_2007_meeting">love to see more of this</a> from the conferences in my field.</p>]]></content>

It probably makes sense for Springer, HHMI and, most importantly, the involved scientists.

Zoho Show is similar to Google Presently, but Slideshare doesn't allow online editing of your presentation and currently you can't limit access to your presentation to just the people you want to.</p><p>Google Presently (and Zoho Show) are a great way to share your presentations for a lab meeting or conference. Email is just not the best tool for this, especially since presentations are usually large files. Did I mention that using either Google Presently and Zoho Show is free?</p>]]></content>

From a technical point of view, it would make a lot of sense if these submission systems are extended to also cover the paper writing process. The major advantage of web-based systems – in contrast to writing your paper in a traditional word processor such as Microsoft Word – is collaboration. And the actual paper submission becomes much easier both for the author and the publisher if the paper is already in the submission system. This could also streamline the peer-review process, as reviewers could (anonymously) write their comments directly into the online text.</p><p>An online paper writing tool could also make business sense. I believe that a large number of authors would consider such a system even with a fee of $25-50 per paper. This could generate enough revenue to cover the development and maintenance costs of such a system.</p>]]></content>

Looking at Google Docs as an example (Zoho Writer shares many of the strenghts and weaknesses), I wanted to find out if they are mature enough to write a scientific paper.</p><h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3><p>The major strength is collaboration. All documents are stored online, which makes it very easy for several people to work on a document simultaneously.

Google Docs currently doesn't support footnotes or endnotes, so you can't roll your own references. Google Docs supports font formatting, but unfortunately that doesn't include the Symbol font – needed in almost all scientific documents. And Google Docs online works with an online internet connection, although offline support may come in the form of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101232/http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a>, Zoho Writer already supports Google Gears.</p><h3 id="the-summary">The Summary</h3><p>Google Docs is <em><em>almost</em></em> ready to be an attractive tool for scientific writing.

But Google already has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101232/http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>, maybe the two can be integrated?</p><p>For now, Google Docs can help with papers that have many active authors (e.g. a review article), but the final steps still have to be done with a word processor.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.publishers.org/main/PressCenter/PRISMLaunch.htm">August 23</a>, the Partnership for Research Integrity in Science and Medicine or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.prismcoalition.org/">PRISM</a> was announced. PRISM is a lobbying organisation created by the Professional &amp; Scholarly Publishing Division (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.pspcentral.org/">PSP</a>) of the Association of American Publishers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.publishers.org/">AAP</a>). The main purpose of PRISM appears to lobby legislators in Washington to not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research">sign legislation</a> that would require public access to all scientific papers within 12 months after publication.</p><p>While there are many good arguments for or against this change in legislation, and you would expect many AAP members to oppose this measure, PRISM is different in that it is a pure lobbying effort – e.g. read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.prismcoalition.org/myth.htm">Myth vs. fact: Setting the Record Straight on Scholarly Journals</a>. The two main arguments used are:</p><ul><li>open access undermines the peer review process</li><li>requiring deposition in public repositories leads to government interference in scientific publishing</li></ul><p>These “arguments” were obviously created in a PR department, as they don't make sense to anybody involved in scientific publishing. The peer review process is not different in open access journals. And to call deposition of NIH-funded research papers in the NIH-managed PubMed Central “government interference” is difficult to understand.</p><p>PRISM might be successful in avoiding a change in U.S. legislation, but the strange logic used by PRISM could lead many scientists to think twice before submitting a paper to a journal that endorses the PRISM principles. Which in the end could be worse for the journal publisher than the proposed change in legislation.</p><p>Read more about PRISM in Peter Suber's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2007_08_19_fosblogarchive.html#5309199826835837381">blog post</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_number">Hirsch number</a> tries to quantify the (scientific) productivity of a scientist. The Hirsch number was first described by the physicist J.E. Hirsch in a 2005 PNAS paper: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/102/46/16569">An index to quantify an individual’s scientific research output</a>. Hirsch says:</p><blockquote><em>I propose the index h, defined as the number of papers with citation number h, as a useful index to characterize the scientific output of a researcher.</em></blockquote><p>Thus, in contrast to the widely used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor">impact factor</a>, the Hirsch number measures the productivity of an individual scientist and not the journal he publishes in. The Hirsch number tries to factor in both the number of papers and the number of citations of these papers.</p><p>Your personal Hirsch number should be equal or greater the number of years you have already spent in science. Again in contrast to the impact factor, you can calculate your Hirsch number with freely available tools. You can look up your papers in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> and write down the citations for each paper. Or, use online tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://www-ihm.lri.fr/~roussel/moulinette/h/h.cgi">scHolar index</a> to do the work for you.</p><p>Using a simple number to measure the productivity of scientist is a dangerous undertaking. But if numbers are needed (e.g. grant or job applications), the Hirsch number is a good tool. Widespread use of the Hirsch number could have broad implications, as authors would more carefully consider which journals would give them the highest number of citations.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Apple announced the productivity suite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork 08</a> for Macintosh users. iWork 08 includes <em><em>Numbers</em></em>, a new spreadsheet application and updated versions of the presentation and word processing applications <em><em>Keynote</em></em> and <em><em>Pages</em></em>. iWork runs natively (i.e. faster) on Intel Macs and can export to the Microsoft Office 2007 format (read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/7/9/scientific-publishing-and-microsoft-word-2007">my blog post</a> about problems with this format for scientific publishing).</p><h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3><p>The new spreadsheet application in iWork 08. The good mix of graphics, calculating and charting could make this a good tool to create scientific posters. I'm a longtime Freehand user for this purpose, but since further development <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/05/freehand_no_lon.html">has been stopped in favor of Adobe Illustrator</a>, I'm looking for alternatives. Just as in Keynote and Pages, more sophisticated charting options (e.g. displaying standard deviations) are not supported. In contrast to Keynote and Pages, Numbers has no Applescript support.</p><h3 id="keynote">Keynote</h3><p>Keynote is a wonderful application for presentations and I have been using it for many years. Key new features in Keynote 08 are animations and instant alpha, an image editing tool to remove backgrounds. Highly recommended.</p><h3 id="pages">Pages</h3><p>Pages is a good word processing application that is especially suited for graphics-rich documents. Pages 08 can track changes made in a document, and this feature is preserved when exporting to Microsoft Word format. Pages doesn't offer integration with Bibliography tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/index.cgi?page=sente">Sente</a>, and at least part of the reason is the missing programming interface that would allow third-party applications to integrate with Pages. Without bibliographic tools, Pages can't be recommended for any larger scientific text.</p><p>In summary, with the exception of Keynote, iWork is not quite ready for scientists. Adding solid bibliographic features in Pages could change all that. A 469 MB 30-day trial version version can be downloaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.apple.com/iwork/trial/">here</a>. iWork costs $79 (US), €79 (EU) or £55 (UK).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three days ago I blogged about Yale University <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/05/yale-university-drops-biomed-central-membership">dropping</a> their Biomed Central (BMC) membership. Matthew Cockerill, the BMC publisher yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/yale_and_open_access_publishing">wrote a response</a>. Briefly, he argues that the author-pays model is a viable business model for Open Access publishing and that the rising costs cited by Yale are simply a reflection of the increasing number of articles submitted to BMC.</p><p>This is an important discussion. I believe that the costs (especially work hours) associated with publishing an article can still be reduced by intelligent use of Web 2.0 technologies (see also my blog post on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/7/9/scientific-publishing-and-microsoft-word-2007">document formats</a>). I also believe that the appropriate business model very much depends on the journal type.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Yale University science libraries have decided to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120709/http://www2.library.yale.edu/movabletype/scilib/archive/2007/08/library_drops_b_1.html">cancel their Biomed Central membership</a>. Dramatically increasing page charges are the reason behind this decision. Other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120709/http://www.biomedcentral.com/inst/cou/840">former members</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120709/http://www.biomedcentral.com/">Biomed Central</a> include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Brown University, The Jackson Laboratory, the drug company Eli Lilly, University of Oxford, Cancer Research UK, EMBL and DKFZ in Heidelberg, and many others.</p><p>The business model of Biomed Central and many other open access puplishers relies on author charges to compensate for the costs to publish a journal article. This is in contrast to the journal subscription model of traditional publishers. Biomed Central membership means that the author charges are picked up by the institution, just as the institution traditionally pays for most journal subscriptions.</p><p>Yale University <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120709/http://www.library.yale.edu/science/oads.html">argues</a> that author charges are not the best way to compensate for the costs of publishing a journal article, mainly because far fewer funding sources have to come up for the costs of publishing an article.</p><p>Increasing article costs are a driving force behind the open access movement (copyright retention by the author is the other important factor). The real cost for publishing an article is very difficult to calculate. For example, peer review is traditionally not paid for even though it is central to the publication process. The indirect costs of producing an article have moved more and more to the author, as electronic submissions now frequently require a lot of formatting and other pre-publishing work.</p><p>Most importantly, the publication cost should be put into perspective to the total cost of a research project. In almost all cases, the publication cost will be just a small fraction of the work hours, equipment and reagents that were needed to submit the paper in the first place.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is currently recommending public access of all papers from NIH-funded research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517063146/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/Final_Report_20060201.pdf"><strong>Fewer than 5% of research papers</strong></a> have gone this route since the policy went into effect in 2005. On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517063146/http://www.scientificblogging.com/news/house_of_representatives_backs_faster_public_access_to_nih_studies"><strong>July 19, 2007</strong></a> the House of Representatives passed the FY2008 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Bill that will make public access within 12 months of publication a requirement for all NIH-funded work. The bill still has to be approved by the Senate.</p><p>What is the policy of other granting agencies on open access requirements for funded work?</p><p><strong>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</strong><br>On June 26, 2007 the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517063146/http://www.hhmi.org/news/20070626.html"><strong>HHMI</strong></a> announced that original research papers by HHMI scientists have to be publicly available within 6 months of publication. The policy goes into effect for all papers submitted on or after January 1, 2008 where a HHMI scientist is first author, last author and/or corresponding author.</p><p><strong>Welcome Trust</strong><br>All publications of research funded by the British <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100122231246/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD002766.html"><strong>Welcome Trust</strong></a> have to be publicly available within 6 months of publication since October 1, 2006.</p><p><strong>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</strong><br>The German DFG has issued recommendations for open access in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100122231246/http://www.dfg.de/aktuelles_presse/information_fuer_die_wissenschaft/andere_verfahren/info_wissenschaft_04_06.html"><strong>January 2006</strong></a>. Although scientists receiving DFG grants are encouraged to have their papers publicly available, there is no requirement to do so.</p><p><strong>CNRS, INSERM, INRA and INRIA</strong><br>The French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), the National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) and the National Research Institute for IT and Robotics (INRIA) have created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100122231246/http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/332.htm"><strong>publicly available institutional repositories</strong></a> for their researchers. Deposition of papers in these repositories is voluntary.</p><p>In summary, there is a clear trend towards making open access a requirement for funding. The taxpayer-funded research agencies – or rather the legislators – have more problems with making this a requirement than the private charities (Welcome Trust and HHMI).</p>]]></content>
