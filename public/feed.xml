        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.datacite.org/news/martin-fenner-and-laura-rueda-join-datacite-team.html">Starting next week</a> I will work as the DataCite Technical Director, and I am excited about this new opportunity. But this is material for another post, here I want to reflect on the last three years working as Technical Lead for the <a href="http://lagotto.io/plos/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics</a> project.</p>
<p>It feels much longer than three years, but until May 2012 I worked as medical oncologist at Hannover Medical School, treating patient with cancer, attending interdisciplinary tumor boards and helping with clinical trials. It was a very brave move by PLOS to hire me at this point, especially since I <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/why-should-we-work-where-we-live">worked remotely</a> from Germany rather than in the San Francisco office. I will be forever thankful to PLOS for giving me this opportunity.</p>
<p>Two factors probably played a role in this decision: I have been blogging about how the internet is changing scholarly communication since 2007, and since September 2010 I had <a href="http://blogs.plos.org">my blog on the PLOS Blogs Network</a>. I had also visited the PLOS offices in San Francisco, and had met several PLOS people at conferences, including Pete Binfield, Rich Cave, Mark Patterson, Brian Mossop, Jennifer Lin and Liz Allen. I had <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">interviewed</a> Pete Binfield about PLOS ONE and the PLOS Article-Level Metrics project in August 2009, shortly after the project was launched.</p>
<p>The other factor was the hackathon at the 2011 Science Online London conference. We were a really small group of people (I remember Jason Hoyt, Victor Henning, Kristi Holmes and Cameron Neylon, Mendeley was hosting the event), but I had the idea to hack the open source PLOS Article-Level Metrics application. This hack turned into <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/announcing-sciencecard/">ScienceCard</a>, a version of the PLOS Article-Level Metrics application focussing on people rather than articles, and the application was a finalist for the <a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/highlighting-research/the-top-101-apps-in-the-mendeley-plos-binary-battle/">Mendeley/PLOS API Binary Battle</a>. ScienceCard doesn’t exist anymore, but the concept of organizing metrics around a person lives on in ImpactStory, facilitated by the launch of ORCID in October 2012. More importantly - without me knowing it - ScienceCard demonstrated that I could work with and extend the PLOS Article-Level Metrics code, and I think I was the first person outside of PLOS doing this. Which must have helped when PLOS was looking for a technical lead for the project a few months later.</p>
<p>In other words, blogging and hacking code can lead to great job opportunities.</p>
<p>While at PLOS I not only learned a ton of things about article-level metrics and all its challenges and opportunities, but also many basic skills needed in software development. Which is important, as my formal training is in clinical medicine and molecular biology, and doing software development in your free time (which I had done since the 1990s) only gets you so far. Some of the unexpected things I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Visualizations</strong></strong>: while it was clear that I was expected to generate visualizations for the PLOS Article-Level Metrics data, I didn’t expect this to go so deep, first with R and later with <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>. Najko Jahn introduced me to using R to analyze the PLOS data, and I later worked closely with Scott Chamberlain from the <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> project to help improve their <a href="https://ropensci.org/tutorials/alm_tutorial.html">alm package</a>. The Javascript work with d3.js started with AlmViz at the 2012 ALM hackathon and later was done in close collaboration with Juan Alperin from the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">Public Knowledge Project</a>.</li>
<li><strong><strong>DevOps</strong></strong>: the intersection of software development and system administration. I became a big fan and have spent endless hours learning how to automate the configuration and deployment of servers and other infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>O<strong>pen source community building</strong></strong>: again something I was expected to do around the PLOS article-level metrics open source application, but I never expected this to be so challenging and time-consuming, but also rewarding.</li>
</ul>
<p>I thank everyone at PLOS who I had the pleasure to work with over the years, in particular Kristen Ratan, Cameron Neylon, Donna Okubo, Mei Yan Leung, Liz Allen, Catriona MacCallum, Matt Hodgkinson, Theo Bloom, Damian Pattinson, Ginny Barbour, Emma Ganley, Roli Roberts, Eric Martens, Susan Au, Matt Willman, Edgar Munoz, Rachel Drysdale, CJ Rayhill, Lisa Siegel, Jennifer Song, Polina Grinbaum, John Bertrand, Mike Baehr, Clark Hartsock, Adam Hyde, and Holly Allen. A very special thanks goes to Jennifer Lin, Rich Cave and John Chodacki who worked with me on a daily basis.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago I wrote a <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">blog post</a> about component DOIs. It is time to revisit the topic, in particular since our approach to citing data associated with a publication has changed since 2011.</p>
<p>Component DOIs are explained in the <a href="http://help.crossref.org/components">CrossRef Help System</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
DOIs may be assigned to items that are part of a journal article, book chapter, or any other content item. A component would typically be a figure, table, or image which is part of or referred to by the parent item. Assigning a DOI to a component allows direct linking to the component item.
</blockquote>
<p>Component DOIs are DOIs, i.e. persistent identifiers that link directly to the resource in question, e.g. a figure in a publication. The component DOI for a figure in a PLOS paper used in the 2011 post still <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002">works as expected</a>, despite changes to the URL of the journal landing page.</p>
<p>The problem with component DOIs is the problem with DOIs in general: there is basic functionality common to all DOIs, and there are additional services specific to subgroups of DOIs. This confuses users - in particular since there is no easy way to immediately see what kind of DOI they have in front of them - and in the case of component DOIs there is one important feature missing.</p>
<p>DOis are assigned by registration agencies (CrossRef and DataCite are the most relevant ones for scholarly content), and these RAs have built different services around DOIs, e.g. different ways to describe and search the metadata (title, authors, etc.) associated with a DOI. Component DOIs are again different, the most important difference is that in the CrossRef implementation they they are not discoverable by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv22n3.2010.06">querying the CrossRef system</a>. Component DOIs are also always associated with a parent DOI (for the article, book, etc.). Although this is the expected behavior, we shouldn’t expect component DOIs to always look like an extension of the parent DOI, as in <code>10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002</code> used in the example above.</p>
<p>In essence, a component DOI is a <strong><strong>DOI light</strong></strong>. We can use them for persistent linking, but we can’t use them for discovery via the CrossRef Metadata Search (and by extension other indexing services). A common use case for component DOIs is supplementary information in a journal article. Content in supplementary information files is already much harder to find than content in the body of an article, using component DOIs instead of regular DOIs makes the content again harder to find.</p>
<p>All of this might not have been much of an issue when I wrote the 2011 post, but making the data underlying a publication publicly available and discoverable is increasingly becoming something that funders, publishers and institutions expect. Most of these data are not deposited in dedicated data repositories, but in supplementary information files (for PLOS articles published since March 2014 this is true for more than 50% of papers). Using regular DOIs for supplementary information files with proper metadata and proper inclusion in indexing services will make it easier to find, access and reuse these data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that still leaves us with the problem that the supplementary information files then will have CrossRef DOIs, whereas data repositories typically use DataCite DOIs, so that we need to search for these datasets in two different places. But that is material for another post.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.digital-science.com/events/scifoo-camp-2015/">SciFoo Camp</a> this weekend <a href="https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/">Erin McKiernan</a> and I moderated an unconference session on the topic <strong>Why should we work where we live?</strong> This was a spontaneous idea after we had talked about this topic on Friday (Erin lives in Mexico with a job in Canada, I live in Germany and work for an organization in San Francisco).</p>
<p>We quickly realized that this situation is far from uncommon in the space we work in (science and science communication). Most commonly the reason is compromises we have to make when both partners have to find an adequate job. It can be a big challenge for a couple to find senior jobs in academia in the same city or region, especially outside of academic clusters such as Boston, New York or London.</p>
<p>The other big reason for work remote is that some research can only happen in special places, for example in high-energy physics, astronomy or the geosciences. And of course there are other flavors of the same situation, e.g. when a principal investigator moves to a new institution and PhD students or postdocs can’t or don’t want to move with him/her. And most academics have to do at least some remote work, since they will spend a good amount of time traveling to conferences or collaboration partners.</p>
<p>The discussion in the session centered on the social and technical challenges of working remotely. We didn’t have time to go into the legal aspects (e.g. taxes when you work in a different country), or the challenges organizing your personal life, particular difficult when you have children.</p>
<p>We shared our experience with online collaboration tools, and video conferencing with Skype, Google Hangouts or similar was central to this. Videoconferencing can be a challenge with slow internet connectivity, a situation that luckily is constantly improving.</p>
<p>Private group chat tool such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipChat">HipChat</a> or <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> are becoming increasingly popular outside the Tech sector and are a great alternative to email. They not only provide a platform for quick messages between two people, but also serve as a backchannel for informal “water cooler” discussions in an organization.</p>
<p>Another essential category is tools that track your work so that your remote colleagues not only can collaborate with you, but also see the work you are doing. As a supervisor you quickly see the work that was done the past week, a much more reasonable approach than looking at physical presence at work (where people might be doing all kinds of other things and personal productivity varies). Tracking your work is easy if you are a software developer like me and can look at code committed to version control, tickets closed, etc. For research this is more challenging, in particular if the workflow is not digital yet and for example all experiments are documented in a paper notebook. It seems that one requirement for remote work in science is digitalization of your work, but that is a direction we are heading anyway and which has other advantages (e.g. improving reproducibility). If there are no specialized tools for documenting your work available, then a note-taking tool such as <a href="https://www.onenote.com/">OneNote</a> or <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> can be helpful. The digitization and automation of work is obviously limited in wet labs that require direct interactions with samples and instruments.</p>
<p>The social aspects of remote work might be the bigger challenge. There is still a big reluctance in supervisors and administrators to this, assuming that people will only be productive if someone is watching them. This assumption is very short sighted, as what drives PhDs and postdocs to work hard is not supervision, but the intrinsic motivation to accomplish something, in particular in light of the very competitive situation for permanent jobs in academia. The book <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">Remote</a> by Jason Fried talks about this in great detail in the context of software development, but the same principles apply to work in science. What supervisors and administrators loose in direct oversight they can in attracting talent they would otherwise not get. Remote work only works if supported by the host institution, for example by adapting internal workflows and communications to make remote work the default rather than an exception.</p>
<p>Remote work is usually more successful and satisfying if combined with physical presence at the workplace. Reasons for this are not only the part of the work that can’t be done remotely, but more importantly the social aspect. How extensive this physical presence is depends on the circumstances. Some level of remote work has become part of almost everyone’s job in science, as it includes working at home in the evenings or on weekends, or work while traveling.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just like the rest of the internet, much of our scholarly infrastructure is built around the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), increasingly HTTPS for security, and soon <a href="https://http2.github.io/">HTTP/2</a> for better performance. In this infrastructure Universal Resource Locators (URLs) are essential to locate resources (sic) such as scholarly articles, datasets, researchers, organizations, or grants. Read <a href="http://site.thomsonreuters.com/site/data-identifiers/">this</a> recent Thomson Reuters report for a good recent perspective on this topic. While this works for the most part, there are some issues with URLs - not specific to scholarly content, but particularly import here:</p>
<ol>
<li>multiple URLs can point to the same resource</li>
<li>URLs can be long and look ugly</li>
<li>URLs can change or break, making it hard or impossible to locate the resource</li>
<li>we are used to central indexes (or databases) describing these resources, allowing us to do sophisticated queries not possible in a generic web search, e.g. find all publications by author John Doe, published since 2012.</li>
</ol>
<p>No. 1 is a problem relevant to all URLs, e.g. web searches or liking/commenting a particular web page. Originally suggested by Google, <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en">Canonical URLs</a> are essential for services such as Facebook or <a href="https://hypothes.is/blog/cross-format-annotation/">Hypothes.is</a>. They have been formalized in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6596">rfc6596</a> and are commonly used.</p>
<p>No. 2 can be a problem, in particular if we are not careful in designing appropriate URLs for landing pages (see next paragraph), but rather use something long and unreadable that also includes query parameters, etc. If we have no control over how the URL looks like, we can use URL shortener services such as <a href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>, which of course have become a common sight on the web. <a href="http://shortdoi.org/">ShortDOIs</a> are an URL shortener for DOIs, but they don’t seem to have gained much traction.</p>
<p>No. 3 is a particularly important issue, commonly referred to as <strong><strong>link rot</strong></strong> and described extensively for the scholarly literature, e.g. by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115253">Klein</a>. There are several technical solutions to this problem, a common approach is to use a landing page for the resource that will never change (and follows the recommendations by Tim Berners-Lee for <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">Cool URIs</a>, and then use redirection to point to the current location of the resource. This is easily for changes of the URL path using web server <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/remapping.html">redirect rules</a>. It gets more complicated if the server name also changes, in particular if it is the server holding the landing page. Thinking this through you realize that the only way this can be done on a larger scale is via one or more centralized services that not only provide the technical infrastructure for a central redirection (or resolver) service, but also come with a social contract of rules that everyone submitting URLs to the service has to follow - a major difference to URL shorteners, which don’t solve the link rot problem.</p>
<p>The above is of course a description of the DOI service provided by CrossRef, DataCite, and others, as well as similar persistent identifier services. Unfortunately some persistent identifier services don’t do the above: they create and use persistent identifiers, but there is no central resolver service that maps these identifiers back to URLs. This breaks the integration with the bigger scholarly infrastructure based on URLs. One common example are nucleotide sequences such as U65091, there is no single corresponding URL because the sequence can be found in all three main nucleotide databases: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U65091">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U65091</a>. It would help to have a central resolver, e.g. http://nucleotide.org/U65091 that then redirects to one of the three databases based on geographical location or user preference.</p>
<p>There are also problems with DOIs. They use the <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handle</a> system to resolve the identifier to a location, and this system was built in the 1990s as infrastructure <a href="http://www.handle.net/faq.html">independent of</a> URLs or DNS (Domain Name Service), at a time when it wasn’t clear yet that URLs and associated standards would become ubiquitous. I don’t have numbers, but practically all DOIs are of course now resolved to URLs using the <a href="http://www.doi.org/factsheets/DOIProxy.html">DOI proxy server</a> at http://doi.org (preferred) or http://dx.doi.org. One main consequence of this is that DOIs are frequently not written as URLs - e.g. doi:10.5555/24242424x instead of <a href="https://doi.org/10.5555/24242424x">https://doi.org/10.5555/24242424x</a> - again breaking the integration with the bigger scholarly infrastructure. The CrossRef <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/doi_display_guidelines.html">DOI display guidelines</a> clearly state that DOIs should be written as URLs in <em>the online environment</em>, which basically is whenever DOIs are used, as PDFs and even Word documents know how to handle URLs. Unfortunately this guideline is still frequently ignored. The above is of course also true for other persistent identifiers using the Handle system, e.g. <a href="http://www.pidconsortium.eu/">ePIC</a>.</p>
<p>The other problem with the DOI system is that it doesn’t address issue No. 4, i.e. provide a central metadata index for the resources that use the system. This job is left to the DOI registration agencies such as CrossRef and DataCite, who have implemented a central metadata store (e.g. <a href="https://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> or <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>) in different ways (e.g. using different metadata schemata), or not at all. This means that we have to look in several places to find all DOIs associated with author John Doe, published since 2012. Obviously we are used to looking up information in multiple places, but not being able to look up the metadata for a DOI without some extra work (finding out the registration agency for the DOI and then going to the respective metadata store) is a problem. One way around these problems is to use the <a href="https://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html">DOI Content Negotiation Service</a>.</p>
<p>Another problem with the DOI system is more a social than a technical issue. Neither CrossRef nor DataCite seem to enforce that DOIs should always resolve to URLs when using a computer program. DOI resolution for humans works fine, but computers, e.g. command line tools such as cURL, can run into issues such as requiring cookies, javascript or user input, or permission problems getting to the journal landing page (see <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/challenges-in-automated-doi-resolution">this earlier blog post</a> for some numbers). People seem to forget that a DOI that is not actionable is not really useful, and that scholarly infrastructure is not only used by people, but of course also by automated tools.</p>
<p>The persistent identifiers used in our scholarly infrastructure would benefit from a clearer focus on the problems they should solve, starting with No. 1-4 above. One problem is that we probably focus too much on the persistence problem, implied also by the term <strong><strong>persistent identifier</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>PID</strong></strong>. What we have neglected is the resolvable problem, i.e. making as easy as possible to get from the persistent identifier to the resource and/or its metadata. Based on the Den Haag Manifesto and suggested by Todd Vision, we therefore proposed the term <strong><strong>trusted identifier</strong></strong> with the following characteristics in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.824314">conceptual model of interoperability</a> for the <a href="http://odin-project.eu/">ODIN Project</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>are unique on a global scale, allowing large numbers of unique identifiers</li>
<li>resolve as HTTP URI’s with support for content negotiation, and these HTTP URI’s should be persistent.</li>
<li>come with metadata that describe their most relevant properties, including a minimum set of common metadata elements. A search of metadata elements across all trusted identifiers of that service should be possible.</li>
<li>are interoperable with other identifiers through metadata elements that describe their relationship.</li>
<li>are issued and managed by an organization that focuses on that goal as its primary mission, has a sustainable business model and a critical mass of member organizations that have agreed to common procedures and policies, has a governing body, and is committed to using open technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>While not directly relevant for resolving persistent identifiers as URLs, the last point is really important for any persistent identifier infrastructure, <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314859">described in detail recently</a>.</p>
<p>If I would design a persistent identifier service today (as if we would need yet another persistent identifier service), I would build the system around an URL shortening service that I control. The URLs could look very similar to what we have with DOIs now, e.g. <a href="http://doi.org/10.5555/12345678">https://doi.org/10.5555/12345678</a>, but it would be clear that persistent identifiers are URLs, not something separate. Plus we could take advantage of all the lessons learned - and possibly even reuse open source code - with URL shorteners, which are much more widely used than scholarly persistent identifiers.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Julie McMurry and co-authors <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18003">published a preprint</a> <strong><strong>10 Simple rules for design, provision, and reuse of persistent identifiers for life science data</strong></strong>. This is an important paper trying to address a fundamental problem: how can we make persistent identifiers both human-readable and machine-readable?</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by the title (used frequently by <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/ten-simple-rules/">PLOS Computational Biology</a>) - the paper doesn’t describe simple rules that help the average life sciences researcher. Rather, the paper deals with rather complex issues, and has 36 authors.</p>
<p>There is general agreement that we need persistent identifiers for scholarly communication, and that also includes life sciences datasets, the focus of the paper. What is less clear is how to express these persistent identifiers. An identifier such as <strong><strong>AB020317</strong></strong> - for the mouse p53 gene - is ambiguous. It is not clear without additional information that this is an identifier for the GenBank nucleotide database, rather than <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexcycu/8936663973/">something completely different</a>. One common approach to make this identifier unambiguous is to use URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), e.g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB020317">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AB020317</a> in this case.</p>
<p>The paper doesn’t like this approach, and even states that “URIs are still among the most commonly used and most problematic identifiers in the bio-data ecosystem”. The text also states that “their length makes them unwieldy for humans working with the data or for referencing in publications or other text”, but doesn’t go into any detail why URIs are “problematic identifiers”, or why length is an issue in an online environment.</p>
<p>This is an important weakness of the paper, because the authors propose an alternative: CURIEs or <strong><strong>compact URIs</strong></strong>. CURIEs were <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/">proposed</a> by the W3C a few years ago, as a way to make URIs <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/curies-a-cure-for-uris/">more human-readable</a>. The idea is simple, we use a namespace in addition to the local identifier, separated by a colon, e.g. <strong><strong><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AB020317">Genbank:AB020317</a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>This approach has of course been common practice in the life sciences before CURIEs or even the WWW existed, and is still the most common approach how identifiers for life sciences data are referenced in the scholarly literature. Unfortunately there are important problems with CURIEs, most of them mentioned in the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent identifiers need to be resolvable, without additional information we don’t know what to do with <strong><strong><a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/AB020317">Genbank:AB020317</a></strong></strong>. Most life sciences researchers understand this CURIE, but that might not necessarily be true for less commonly used namespaces</li>
<li>Namespaces are not necessarily unique, the paper uses <strong><strong>GEO</strong></strong> (which could mean Gene Expression Omnibus or GeoNames Ontology) as an example</li>
<li>Rule 3 in the paper goes into great detail what characters and patterns should be avoided in local identifiers that are part of a CURIE. It is not clear whether these recommendations will always be followed or how to check them</li>
<li>CURIEs should follow a pattern (regular expression) so that they can be extracted from a text. We <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063184">know</a> that extracting identifiers from journal articles is possible, but difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>URIs don’t have the problems listed above: they resolve, are unique, and there is good understanding (and available tools) of how a valid URI should look like and how to extract URIs from text documents. That is why URIs are good representations of persistent identifiers.</p>
<p>Another problem I have with CURIEs: the idea doesn’t seem to have caught on from the initial work more than five years ago (background reading <a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2011/case-for-curies/">here</a>). I’m not even sure what percentage of persistent identifier experts know about CURIEs.</p>
<p>My recommendation for life sciences data: express persistent identifiers as URIs. Now that can go into 10 simple rules for the average life sciences researcher.</p>
<p><em>P.S. This blog uses a tool <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">I wrote two years ago</a> that automatically turns CURIEs in the text into links.</em></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Using Markdown to author scholarly documents is an attractive alternative to the standard authoring tools Microsoft Word and LaTeX. The feeling shared by many is that <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">Scholarly Markdown</a> is 80% there, and that more effort is needed for the remaining 20% - moving markdown from a niche into the mainstream. What is mainly needed is building tools that connect the existing tools and ideas, resulting in one or more services attractive to a critical number of users. But maybe we also need to rethink the essential parts of Scholarly Markdown. In this post I propose that we expand the concept and define the <em>Scholarly Markdown Bundle</em>.</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that scholarly work can’t be adequately described in a single text document, most commonly the journal article. Not only are there associated metadata, assets such as figures and supplementary information, but also the research data and software needed to produce the work described in the publication. The obvious next step is to think of scholarly work as a collection of objects, most clearly described by Carol Goble and others as <a href="https://researchobject.github.io/specifications/bundle/">Research Object Bundle</a>.</p>
<p>There will probably never be a single authoring tool and format that pleases everyone. Markdown has particular inherent strengths and weaknesses, complex math or tables will probably always be easier with other formats. The strength of markdown is the simplicity of the format. Some things are hard or impossible to do, but many other things are much simpler. Creating a useful markdown editor is much easier than a word processor reading/writing <code>docx</code> format. Markdown is also a perfect format to <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/using-microsoft-word-with-git/">work with</a> version control systems such as git.</p>
<p>This low barrier of entry makes markdown perfect to be integrated into many workflows. And we can go one step further than ePub and Research Object Bundle, which use the related Universal Container Format (<a href="https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/PDFNAV/Universal+Container+Format">UCF</a>) and ePub Open Container Format (<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-ocf.html">OCF</a>), respectively. Instead of using zip to compress a folder into a single file we can use git version control instead: git provides the commands <code>git bundle</code> and <code>git archive</code> to compress a project under version control with or without version history. I feel this format is both more powerful So I propose the <em>Scholarly Markdown Bundle</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>a git repository with one or more markdown files, either as a folder, or compressed into a single file using <code>git bundle</code></li>
<li>a particular flavor or markdown called Scholarly Markdown, and discussed here and elsewhere before</li>
<li>a <code>citeproc.json</code> file in the root of the project that contains all metadata relevant to the container, including references</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>citeproc.json</code> file is similar to the minimal metadata schema <a href="https://github.com/mbjones/codemeta">codemeta</a> proposed by Matt Jones and others, but is in the format used by Pandoc today. This is <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/citeproc-yaml-for-bibliographies/">important</a> because it adds citation parsing support out of the box. The last two points rely on the <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> document conversion tool, so Scholarly Markdown bundles are really <strong><strong>markdown</strong></strong> + <strong><strong>Pandoc</strong></strong> + <strong><strong>Citeproc/CSL</strong></strong> + <strong><strong>git</strong></strong>. The format is flexible enough to not only describe scholarly articles, but also other kinds of scholarly works, including scientific software managed with git version control. And it integrates nicely with a number of existing workflows, e.g. an R project using RStudio for both code and text (in Rmarkdown). This format should also work for blogs like this one, but I would have to separate the blog posts from the Jekyll site generator code, a direction I suggested in the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/blogging-beyond-jekyll/">last</a> post.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog has been on four different platforms since starting in 2007: a custom blogging engine and then <a href="https://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> on <a href="http://network.nature.com/">Nature Network</a> 2007-2010, Wordpress on the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org">PLOS Blogs Network</a> 2010-2013, and the static blogging engine <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> hosted on Github Pages since 2013. It might be time for yet another blogging platform change.</p>
<p>The main reason to switch from Wordpress to Jekyll was the concept of a static site generator: write posts in <a href="http://commonmark.org/">markdown format</a>, store them in a Github repository, and then have Jekyll automatically generate the HTML pages hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The main attraction was the blog posts in markdown format stored in git version control without the need of a database. Jekyll is the glue to make all this work, and I was able to customize Jekyll to my needs, e.g. by using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> for the markdown to html conversion.</p>
<p>While this workflow still makes sense for this blog, there are a number of shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jekyll needs to rebuild the entire site every time I publish a new post. While this isn’t much of a problem for the size of this blog, it doesn’t scale well for larger sites. And the process is more complex if you use custom jekyll plugins like this blog, as you can’t use the automatic Jekyll pipeline provided by Github (hint: use a Travis continuous integration server <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/continuous-publishing/">to build the site</a>)</li>
<li>the web is moving to increasingly sophisticated javascript frontends, using frameworks such as <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>, or frontend libraries for scholarly documents such as <a href="http://elifesciences.org/elife-news/lens">Lens</a>. While they can be used together with Jekyll, that is not a typical use case.</li>
<li>the tight integration between the code to generate the website and the content (Wordpress and other blogging engines have the same approach) is not always the best solution, e.g. when you want to want to generate the pages for something that is not a blog (e.g. a <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/">book</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>What could we do instead?</p>
<blockquote>
Build a Javascript frontend where the content is served via an API built around markdown documents, stored in git version control.
</blockquote>
<h3 id="api">API</h3>
<p>The blog posts are still written in markdown, stored (and version-controlled in a Github repository), but we would now access the content via API. The easiest solution is to use the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/">Github Contents API</a> and either do the markdown to html conversion in javascript yourself, or let the Github API do the conversion to HTML for you. Alternatively we could build our own API, e.g. because we want to control the markdown to html conversion, or need additional functionality such as fulltext search. And of course the two approaches can be combined, e.g. via a Github webhook that triggers the markdown to html conversion every time a document is added or updated, and stores the converted documents in the same repo.</p>
<h3 id="frontend">Frontend</h3>
<p>The frontend should be written as a one-page javascript application, not requiring a server backend. In contrast to the Jekyll workflow the frontend code doesn’t need to be updated every time we post a blog post. Since this is a very common scenario, there are probably several solutions out there already. Please mention them in the comments if you have suggestions. One candidate is <a href="https://github.com/elifesciences/lens/">Lens</a> mentioned above - a beautiful frontend for scholarly documents. Lens displays documents in the <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/index.html">JATS</a> XML format, so your API would have to provide that format.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>The separation into API and frontend is of course old news. But for blogs this seems to still be a fairly new concept, in particular when combined with a backend using documents stored in git version control rather than in a database. Wordpress added a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/">REST API Plugin</a> in 2014, and the Ghost blogging framework (which uses a database backend) also seems to <a href="https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap">go into that general direction</a>. Please ping me if you like the idea and want to contribute, or have implemented something like this already.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Metadata such as author, title, journal or persistent identifier are essential for scholarly documents, and some of us are spending a significant part of our time adding or fixing metadata. Unfortunately we sometimes don’t pay enough attention to the flow of metadata, i.e. we ignore already existing metadata, or reinvent the wheel in how we describe or store them.</p>
<p>Storing metadata in text-based formats is usually straightforward. This blog post is written in markdown with a <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML header</a> - think of YAML as the more human-readable version of JSON - at the beginning of the document:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: Metadata in Microsoft Word documents
---</code></pre>
<p>This is then translated into this HTML when the blog post is published:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Metadata in Microsoft Word documents&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>XML is of course a very natural format for metadata, here for example <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.0/index.html">JATS</a> used for scholarly articles:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;article-title&gt;Metadata in Microsoft Word documents&lt;/article-title&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Many scholarly documents start out as Microsoft Word documents. And while the <code>docx</code> format introduced by Microsoft in Microsoft Office 2007 <a href="http://officeopenxml.com/">is XML-based</a>, few users are aware of this fact. And probably even fewer users (including myself) ever go to the <code>Properties…</code> settings of a <code>docx</code> document and add a <code>title</code>, <code>keywords</code> or other metadata (the <code>author</code> is usually set automatically).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/IC164149.gif" class="kg-image" width="419" height="488" alt="Microsoft Word 2007 Properties. Image from Microsoft Developer Network" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Microsoft Word 2007 Properties. Image from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308936(v=office.12).aspx">Microsoft Developer Network</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is very unfortunate, as these metadata are very often required, e.g. in a journal article submission, and then need to be collected again, usually either by asking the author to fill out a web form, and/or by extracting the metadata (e.g. title) from the document.</p>
<p>The best place for metadata is with the document (not <em>in</em> the document), and if the file format (<code>docx</code> in this case) supports it, we should take advantage of this. The main benefit: metadata stay with the text when the document is sent to co-authors via email, or put on a file server, or into Dropbox.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>docx</code>, the metadata support is actually pretty good, using the standard <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>, and storing the metadata in a separate file called <code>core.xml</code>. You can see this file if you unzip your <code>docx</code> file (e.g. after giving it a <code>zip</code> extension). The <code>core.xml</code> file for this blog post (after converting the markdown file to <code>docx</code> using <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;cp:coreProperties xmlns:cp=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core-properties&quot; xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot; xmlns:dcterms=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&quot; xmlns:dcmitype=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;&lt;dc:title&gt;Metadata in Microsoft Word documents&lt;/dc:title&gt;&lt;dc:creator&gt;&lt;/dc:creator&gt;&lt;/cp:coreProperties&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>docx</code> is XML, we can read/write this file not only in Microsoft Word, e.g. using macros, but also outside of Microsoft Word, e.g. in workflows that converts <code>docx</code> documents into other formats, or tools that check <code>docx</code> files for required metadata (e.g. by using <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/introducing-rakali/">rakali</a> that I wrote last year). So please encourage authors to use the Microsoft Word <code>Properties…</code> settings, and update existing tools to take advantage of the Dublin Core metadata stored in every <code>docx</code> file.</p>

<p>If you want to follow along, please go to <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/software-analysis">https://github.com/mfenner/software-analysis</a>, this repository holds all the data, as well as the R code used for analysis. A special thanks goes to <a href="http://scottchamberlain.info/">Scott Chamberlain</a> who greatly helped me by tweaking the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/alm">alm</a> R package to support URLs instead of DOIs as identifiers.</p>
<p>The first step in the analysis is to get an overview of the external sources citing or discussing the software package:</p>
<p>This is basically the same figure as in the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/metrics-for-scientific-software/">previous post</a>, but with two differences: I have added a <a href="http://www.nature.com/opensearch/">Nature.com OpenSearch</a> data source, and I have found an additional 64 repositories cited in scholarly articles via an Europe PMC full-text Search that also includes the reference lists (thanks to <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/johanna-mcentyre">Jo McEntyre</a>).</p>
<p>I am not sure why we are not picking up any Wikipedia citations, and have to take a closer look. The ORCID source also needs tweaking, and there are some issues with the <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> data that I have to look into as well. Citations in the scholarly literature are obviously the most interesting data, and we have three Github repos with more than 25 citations, including <a href="https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">https://github.com/najoshi/sickle</a> with 54 citations. As most repositories in our sample are cited only once if at all, a correlation with Github stars and forks is not useful. Sickle is popular on Github (52 stars and 32 forks), but it is not clear that this activity is correlated to citations (e.g. because there are more citations than stars).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/github_likes_readers-1.png" class="kg-image" width="672" height="480" alt="Correlation between Github stargazers and forks, log-log scale.

Data from <a href="http://software.lagotto.io">software.lagotto.io</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The vast majority of software repos in this analysis are hosted by Github, so we have the numbers of stars and forks for those. It is interesting, although probably not very surprising, that the number of Github stargazers and forks is highly correlated:</p>
<p>We can find Facebook activity (likes, comments or shares) for one third of the repositories. There is a reasonably good correlation between Facebook activity and number of Github forks:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/9th/facebook_github_readers-1.png" class="kg-image" width="672" height="480" alt="Correlation between combined Facebook activity and Github forks, log-log scale. Data from software.lagotto.io" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Correlation between combined Facebook activity and Github forks, log-log scale. Data from <a href="http://software.lagotto.io">software.lagotto.io</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One interesting analysis would be to look at the repositories that have been forked much more often relative to their Facebook activity, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/impala">Impala</a> with 1,207 Github stars and 458 forks, but only 5 Facebook shares. One limitation of the analysis is that we are not tracking Facebook (or other social media) activity for all forks of a repo.</p>
<p>We found Reddit discussions mentioning one of the repositories in 7% of cases. Once we have a larger sample size it would be interesting to correlate this activity with Github stars and forks, similar to what we did for Facebook. By far the most popular repository from our sample on Reddit is <a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, followed by <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery">JQuery</a>. Twitter activity is notoriously difficult to collect since Twitter doesn’t keep tweets very long, hence probably the low numbers compared to Facebook and Reddit.</p>
<p>Feel free to play with the data and scripts provided at <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/software-analysis">https://github.com/mfenner/software-analysis</a>, my next step is probably to include a much larger number of software repositories.</p>
<p>It has not escaped our notice that the kind of analysis described above could be applied to any software repository, not just scientific software.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The iTunes Store was opened by Apple in 2003 to sell digital music and other digital assets. Since 2009 music purchased in the iTunes store is free of Digital Rights Management (DRM). Apple became the largest music vendor worldwide in 2010, and by 2013 had sold 25 billion songs.</p>

<p>Scholarly articles are distributed almost exclusively in digital form. While there is an increasing number of journal articles freely available via green or gold open access, the majority of them still can only be read if the reader works at an institution with a subscription to the journal. Many journals also allow the reader to buy a single article of interest, for prices between $10 and more than $30:</p>

</figure>
<p>There is also a document delivery service provided by libraries, but that option varies considerably by country and in Germany for example means a scanned article as printout rather than the original PDF because of a change in German copyright law a few years ago. There are also the services <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/">DeepDyve</a> and <a href="https://www.readcube.com/">ReadCube</a>, but again you don’t get the PDF (or only for prices similar to those quoted above), but rather limited access for reading and printing.</p>
<p>In summary, affordable access to scholarly content by subscription publishers is in a dire state: you either have to work at an academic institution subscribing to the desired journal, get only a crippled version of the article (online viewing only), or pay up to $30 for a single article, which clearly doesn’t scale beyond very occasional use.</p>
<p>With this background it is obvious that several people have discussed the iTunes Store-like model to sell scholarly articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://crosstech.crossref.org/2009/09/prc_report_and_ipub_revisited.html">PRC Report and “iPub” revisited</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2009-10/deepdyve-launches-itunes-science-papers">DeepDyve launches iTunes Store-like service for science papers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2012/01/10/could-an-itunes-like-model-wor/">Could an iTunes-like model work with scientific publishing?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/10/07/start-readcube-program-uses-itunes-payment-model-for-access-scientific-articles/1UopCX1qfEE3uO2UEzuM7L/story.html">A plan to open up science journals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/when-the-rebel-alliance-sells-out">When the Rebel Alliance Sells Out</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The best already existing platforms to build such as service are reference managers, as most of them have learned now to manage PDF files, and have an online component. ReadCube is offering a pay-per-view option already, Papers, Mendeley, Endnote or others could get into this business.</p>
<p>One of the big advantages of payments for single articles is transparency, as institutions and users only pay for what they actually use. Price transparency is one of the big problems with the <em>big deal</em> contracts that academic institutions have with publishers - read <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1403006111">this article</a> for more info.</p>
<p>But rather than becoming the predominant way to pay for digital music, services such as DeepDyve and ReadCube are only playing a marginal role. Why is that so?</p>
<ul>
<li>whereas digital music is paid for by the consumer, there is usually a middleman in the form of the library for scholarly articles, which makes the payment process more complex.</li>
<li>subscription publishers have focused all their efforts on selling big deals with increasing numbers of journals to libraries. Prices of $30 per article are clearly intended to discourage payment for single articles (which could jeopardize journal bundles) rather than offering an earnest payment option.</li>
<li>Apple was in a strong negotiation position with record labels when starting the iTunes store (the extremely popular iPod, record labels scared of file-sharing platforms such as Napster). No organization is in a similar position with scientific publishers, and services such as ReadCube or Mendeley are handicapped because they are associated with a particular publisher</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless several large publishers and/or a smart third-party with enough muscle start an initiative in this space, e.g. by bringing the pay-per-view prices to a reasonable level (e.g. $4.99), we will never see an iTunes Store-like service for scholarly articles, and this currently looks like the most likely outcome. We may have reached the point where it is too late, as most publishers seem to already work towards another payment model: gold open access where the authors pay the article costs.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges of collecting metrics for scholarly outputs is persistent identifiers. For journal articles the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) has become the de-facto standard, other popular identifiers are the pmid from PubMed, the identifiers used by Scopus and Web of Science, and the arxiv ID for ArXiV preprints.</p>
<p>For other research outputs the picture is less clear. DOIs are also used for datasets, but so are many other identifiers, in particular in the life sciences.</p>
<p>To collect metrics for research outputs, the requirements are slightly different. We need identifiers understood by the services collecting the metrics, not by the data repository or other service that is holding the research output (the only exception is usage stats, which are generated locally). For many services, in particular social media such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit, the primary identifier for a resource is a URL. This means that we should have one or more URLs for every research output where we want to track the metrics - typically the publisher or data repository landing page. Since URLs can be messy, Google, Facebook and others have come up with the concept of a <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.de/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html">canonical URL</a>, and some care should go into constructing proper canonical URLs (see <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/challenges-in-automated-doi-resolution">this blog post</a> for examples of what can go wrong).</p>
<p>The Den Haag Manifesto is the result of a <strong><strong>Knowledge Exchange</strong></strong> workshop held in June 2011 and tries to bring Persistent Identifiers and Linked Open Data together. The first principle is very much in line with what I said above:</p>
<blockquote>
Make sure PIDs can be referred to as HTTP URI’s, including support for content negotiation.
</blockquote>
<p>Or, to put this differently: URLs are good enough to start collecting metrics for scholarly outputs. Scientific software is a good example where persistent identifiers are not commonly used (despite efforts such as <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">this one</a>), but we can still collect many meaningful metrics using the repository URL (and the open source software <a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto">lagotto</a>):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/software.lagotto.io.png" class="kg-image" width="1468" height="686" alt="Number of software repositories (out of 1,404) with at least one event. Data from software.lagotto.io" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Number of software repositories (out of 1,404) with at least one event. Data from software.lagotto.io</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The last three rows are citations in the scholarly literature found via fulltext search of BioMed Central, Europe PMC and PLOS. URLs (in contrast to persistent identifiers represented as strings and/or numbers) are easy to find, the main limitation is not so much using a URL rather than a DOI, but that scientific software typically is mentioned in the text without appearing in the reference list. This makes it hard to impossible to find articles mentioning the software that are not open access, which unfortunately is still the majority of them.</p>
<p>We are of course also tracking the discussion of the software in social media, and are collecting the number of stars and forks in Github and Bitbucket. Overall there is quite a lot of activity, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">Windowed Adaptive Trimming for fastq files using quality</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lh3/wgsim">Reads simulator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://software.lagotto.io/works/url/https://github.com/lh3/seqtk">Toolkit for processing sequences in FASTA/Q formats</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All three software repos have been cited in the scholarly literature at least ten times. What is missing is infrastructure that tracks the citations of scientific software, so that we can give proper scientific credit to the authors of the software, and can discover other research projects using the same tools. software.lagotto.io uses a list of software repos collected by Jure Triglav for ScienceToolbox, and a scientific software index is indeed one of the important missing pieces.</p>

<p>Last month at the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/pre-conference-meeting-list">Force15 conference</a> in Oxford <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMulvany">Ian Mulvany</a> and I ran a workshop on <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/data-citation-support-in-reference-managers/">data citation support in reference managers</a>. The report of that workshop isn’t done yet, but I can say that it was a success - we now have a pretty good idea what the problems are and what needs to be done to fix them. The short summary of the workshop is in <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mfenner/workshop-summary-reference-managers-and-data-citation">this</a> slide deck of the presentation that summarized the workshop for the other Force15 attendees.</p>
<p>The whole idea of the workshop was to treat data citation as similar as possible to the citation of journal articles, i.e. to allow authors to use the same tools (reference managers) and conventions (citation styles). Putting a data citation into a reference list makes it easier to find that data citation because reference lists contain more metadata, are more structured, and more accessible than data citations in the form of identifiers or links within the body text of the article.</p>
<p>But I have to admit that there is one problem with reference lists: although there is always some self-citation, reference lists usually contain references to articles (and other resources) created by other people and before the article was published. It feels a little bit odd to put a dataset created by the same group of people and published at the same time into the reference list. And although we could use a separate reference list or highlight the data associated with the article in some other way, what we really want is something slightly different, a manifest file.</p>
<p>The journal article has been a (mainly) textual document for many centuries not because this is the essence of science communication, but rather because there was no practical way to include all the other information (raw data, tools used for experiments, etc.). Very few of these limitations remain with the digital journal article that we have since the 1990s, but we have for the most part failed to change the format other than going from paper to PDF. One of many examples: figures in publications typically still are has limited as they were decades ago with no way to see the data underlying the figure, options for selecting what data points are shown, or animation for time-based information.</p>
<p>So what we really care about is the sum of artifacts and resources that together make what Carol Goble and others call <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2010.4626.1">research object</a>, the journal article is an important part, but clearly doesn’t include everything that is needed to understand and reproduce the work. Reference lists can help with linking to some of the resources not included in the article text, but they typically don’t link to supplementary information or other places where the underlying data are made available, or to the figures of the article. Although some publishers provide navigation tools for readers to get to this information, what we really need is a machine-readable list of all the resources used in an article.</p>
<p>As it happens, this is exactly what the ePub format for electronic books is doing, as every ePub must include a manifest file that lists all the files that are part of the publication, defined in the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm">Open Packaging Format (OPF)</a>. I need to do more research to figure out how to do this with <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/index.html">JATS</a>, the standard for scholarly articles, and how to generate something similar to the manifest file when using different formats, e.g. html or markdown. This has to be linked to some of the information we are collecting already, e.g. described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0014.106">JATS</a>, or the <code>relatedIdentifier</code> in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5438/0010">DataCite metadata</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the title of an upcoming workshop next Sunday organized by Ian Mulvany and myself. The workshop is a <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/pre-conference-meeting-list">pre-conference event</a> of the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015">Force15</a> conference in Oxford. This blog post summarizes some of the issues and work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>Data Citation is one of the big themes of the Force15 conference, and a lot of progress has been made, including the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (Data Citation Synthesis Group 2014) that start with the following paragraph on <strong><strong>Importance</strong></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
Data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research. Data citations should be accorded the same importance in the scholarly record as citations of other research objects, such as publications.
</blockquote>
<p>Convincing researchers, funders, university administrators and others that data citation is important is crucial. But for researchers to actually adopt data citation to the same degree as citations of the scholarly literature, more needs to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>incentives (both carrots and sticks) by funders, institutions, and scholarly societies</li>
<li>training in data management</li>
<li>data repositories and other tools and services for the public sharing of data</li>
<li>tools and services that help citing those datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus of the workshop is on the last bullet point, and I would argue that more work still needs to be done here compared to the first three bullet points.</p>
<h2 id="reference-managers">Reference Managers</h2>
<p>Researchers use reference managers to handle the citations in the manuscripts they write. This is both a common practice that everybody understands, and there are a plethora of tools - both free and paid - available. Most reference managers were originally built to handle citations of journal articles and maybe books or book chapters, and many of them also help with managing the associated PDF files. In the last 15 years we have seen an dramatic increase of non-article citations in reference lists, mainly to web resources (Klein et al., 2014):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/journal.pone.0115253.g002.png" class="kg-image" width="2785" height="2595" alt="From Fig. 2: STM articles and URI references per publication year - Elsevier corpus (Klein et al. 2014)" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">From Fig. 2: STM articles and URI references per publication year - Elsevier corpus (Klein et al. 2014)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>References managers have started to adapt to these changes in citation patterns. Similarly they have become better in handling non-textual resources such as slide decks, datasets, or movies. Nobody should type in references by hand in 2015, as reference managers have come up with several ways of importing metadata about citations:</p>
<ul>
<li>import references stored in a file using a format such as BibTex or RIS</li>
<li>import references by talking to an external API</li>
<li>import references via a bookmarklet that grabs information from the current webpage in the browser</li>
</ul>
<p>Endnote and Papers typically use the second approach whereas Mendeley, Zotero (and others) work almost exclusively via bookmarklets (and there are of course combinations of both). Bookmarklets in general work better for web resources and other content that is not indexed in a central service such as Web of Science or Scopus. This is also true for research data, as there are currently few central research data indexing services - the Thomson Reuters <a href="http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/">Data Citation Index</a> and <a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> are two examples in this category. But there are also thousands of data repositories, many of them listed in re3data (Pampel et al., 2013).</p>
<p>The reference manager <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> has built a large open source ecosystem around bookmarklets (what they call <a href="https://github.com/zotero/translators">web translators</a>), making it straightforward to add support for a new resource, as I have done for <a href="https://github.com/zotero/translators/blob/master/NCBI%20Nucleotide.js">GenBank nucleotide sequence datasets</a> in November after learning the basics in a <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/webinar-on-writing-zotero-translators/">webinar</a> given by Sebastian Karcher, a frequent contributor to Zotero web translators.</p>
<p>There is no technical reason that reference managers can’t support a broad range of objects to cite, including datasets. And integration of data citation into the reference manager workflow is not only the easiest and most natural way for the author of a paper, but also makes it easier to discover these citations - reference lists are simply much better for that than links in the text, in particular if the content is behind subscription walls. There is a long tradition in the life sciences to put identifiers for genetic sequences used in a publication right into the text (usually into the methods section). Links in the body text are worse than references in reference lists, <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">identifiers without a link</a> are even worse, as they are very hard to find in an automated way (Kafkas, Kim, &amp; McEntyre, 2013).</p>
<p>Please come to our workshop on Sunday afternoon if you are in Oxford and are interested in this topic. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-citation-support-in-reference-managers-tickets-15136593960">Registration</a> is free, and the workshop will include both presentations about the current state of data citation support in the reference managers Endnote, Papers, Mendeley and Zotero, and work in smaller groups on practical implementations.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/please-keep-it-simple-citations-links-and-references/">blog post two weeks ago</a> I argued for the need for reference managers to properly support data citation, if we want data citation to become a standard activity. I am happy to announce two events working towards that goal.</p>
<h2 id="november-3rd-webinar-on-writing-zotero-web-translators">November 3rd: Webinar on writing Zotero web translators</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/community-spotlight-sebastian-karcher/">Sebastian Karcher</a>, one of the most prolific authors of Zotero web translators (and citation styles), has kindly offered to hold an introductory webinar on writing Zotero web translators. These web translators allow Zotero to import metadata about a scholarly work from a variety of places, and new web translators for repositories that hold research data (or software) would go a long way towards making data citation easier for authors. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/translators">Web translators</a> are written in Javascript and only basic Javascript knowledge is required. The free webinar takes place on November 3rd on 5 PM UK time (12 PM EST) and the registration form is <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/writing-zotero-translators-webinar-tickets-13768797845">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="january-11-force11-pre-conference-workshop-on-data-citation-support-in-reference-managers">January 11: Force11 Pre-Conference workshop on Data Citation Support in Reference Managers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/pre-conference-meeting-list">This workshop</a>, co-organized with Ian Mulvany, will extend the Zotero web translator work to other reference managers, including Papers and Mendeley. This will be a hackathon with the goal to get some things working in these reference managers, but it should also be interesting for others, as we will discuss what is missing to make data citation work in reference managers.</p>
<p>My personal goal is to learn to write a Zotero web translator in the webinar, and then write a working web translator for the three biological databases ENA, PDB and Uniprot before the January workshop. And hopefully these activities generate enough interest that other people write web translators for their favorite research data database or software repository, and that the proprietary reference managers Papers and Mendeley (and hopefully others) also add support for these data sources.</p>

<p>This year’s <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/09/how-to-get-a-ticket-for-this-years-spoton-london">SpotOn London conference</a> takes place November 14-15 and the registration has opened this Monday. I am helping organize this conference since 2009, and I again look forward to the sessions, and - more importantly - the discussions with people in and between sessions this year.</p>
<p>The name (ScienceBlogging London, ScienceOnline London, SpotOn London), the location (Royal Institution, British Library, Wellcome Conference Center), the people organizing (too many to mention, but Nature Publishing Group always at the core), and the fringe events (lots of cool things from <a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-life/science-blogging-2008-part-i/">science tours</a> to <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-fringe-event-the-story-collider-2/">Story Collider</a>) and the format have always changed slightly over the years, and this year again is a bit different. The biggest change is obviously that <a href="https://twitter.com/louwoodley">Lou Woodley</a> is no longer an organizer (as she announced at last year’s conference), but this is also the first SpotOn conference with a theme:</p>
<blockquote>
The challenges of balancing the public and the private in the digital age
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously a very broad topic, but nicely encompasses many important issues that we are dealing with in scholarly communication today. The draft program is posted <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/13/spoton-london-2014-draft-programme">here</a>, and I’m helping organize the sessions on <strong><strong>sharing sensitive data</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>open peer review</strong></strong>. More details will follow for all these sessions.</p>

</figure>
<p>The second day of the conference will be in unconference (or barcamp) format and the program drafted by the delegates in the morning. This format is popular in the science communications community (I first heard about the project that became my current job at <a href="https://editor.front-matter.io/lets-do-an-unconference/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">SciBarCamp in 2009</a>), and SpotOn London has used this format in the first conference in 2008 (and again in 2009):</p>
<p>For people not familiar with this format the idea of a conference (day) without predetermined topics or speakers sounds scary. As it turns out, the problem is usually not the lack of ideas or people wanting to talk, but rather how to coordinate this in a way that everyone who wants to get involved can do so, and it doesn’t become a discussion among those with the loudest voices (and biggest egos). My experience with SpotOn London and other conferences I enjoyed is that the best sessions are usually those that allow for a good discussion, and not those with the most polished PowerPoint slides. Some suggestions for when you attend an unconference for the first time:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to sessions with topics you know little about, but want to learn more</li>
<li>when suggesting a session, do this together with others</li>
<li>suggest topics that are focussed and unusual, not the obvious ones we always talk about</li>
<li>don’t even think about doing a PowerPoint presentation</li>
<li>when moderating a session, be a good moderator, not a good speaker</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/please-keep-it-simple/">last post</a> I wrote about the importance of keeping things simple in scholarly publishing, today I want to go into more detail with one example: citations in scholarly documents.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/lego_discussion.jpg" class="kg-image" width="700" height="600" alt="LEGO scientists discuss how they can cite their data" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">LEGO scientists discuss how they can cite their data</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Citations are an essential part of scholarly documents, and they are summarized in the references section at the end of the article or book chapter. The problem is that not everything that is cited in a scholarly document ends up in the references list. Examples of this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>web links, e.g. to reagents or other resources</li>
<li>identifiers for biological databases such as GenBank that are typically included in the text as identifiers or as links</li>
<li>footnotes with links to external resources</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words: we are not consistent in how we cite other content. And this is a problem because we are making it more difficult than necessary for authors, publishers and everyone else to handle these various citation flavors and, more importantly, we are loosing citations along the way. This is a particular problem for data citation, as the seminal 2013 paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063184">Kafkas et al</a>. has shown for citations to the three biological databases ENA (European Nucleotide Archive), PDB and Uniprot:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a large numbers of accession numbers in the Open Access subset of PubMed Central (e.g. 160,112 ENA accession numbers for papers published up until June 2012)</li>
<li>text mining using the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit/">Whatizit</a> tool can retrieve most of these identifiers</li>
<li>there is only partial overlap between database identifiers annotated by publishers and database identifiers found by text mining</li>
<li>the overlap is even smaller between papers citing database identifiers, and papers cited in biological databases such as ENA</li>
<li>the study was limited to Open Access journals, as only for them the full-text articles could be text mined</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/18th/ena_overlap.png" class="kg-image" width="415" height="194" alt="Comparison between article-to-database and database to citations (Kafkas et al., 2013)." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Comparison between article-to-database and database to citations (Kafkas et al., 2013).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, even though including identifiers for biological databases has been an accepted community standard that every author and publisher is following for a long time, the proper citation of these identifiers is still often broken. The picture doesn’t seem to be any better for DOIs for datasets: while they are fairly common by now, their use in scholarly articles differs widely from appearance in the references list to links in the materials and methods section to no mention at all.</p>
<p>There are various ways how this can be fixed (e.g. requiring authors to use biological database identifiers in a consistent way, better text mining tools, opening up subscription content to text mining), but the best solution is the simplest one: every citation in a paper should go into the references list. As an example I have added the ENA mRNA U65091 (Shioda, Fenner, &amp; Isselbacher, 1997) - something I worked on a long time ago - to the references list of this post.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>For this to work, it is essential that reference managers - the software authors use to generate the references list - properly support citations to data, including biological databases. It appears that all major reference managers support datasets as reference type and there is good community agreement what a data citation should look like (<a href="https://www.force11.org/datacitation">Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles</a>). What is missing is support for easily importing the required metadata for these datasets, and reference managers use two approaches for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>query external databases via API and pull in the required metadata (e.g. Papers, Endnote)</li>
<li>browse to the webpage describing the database entry and import the metadata via bookmarklet/web importer (e.g. Zotero, Mendeley)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches require custom code for every database. Whereas many reference managers use Citation Style Language (<a href="http://citationstyles.org/">CSL</a>) as a standard way to format references, no such standard exists for web importers. Which means that every reference manager has to implement this separately, and most of them are not open source software so that the community could help.</p>
<p>PLOS Labs is holding a <a href="http://www.ploslabs.org/citation-hackathon/">Citation Hackathon</a> on October 18 in their San Francisco office. While I can’t attend in person, I want to contribute to this hackathon in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>do an evaluation of how the reference managers Papers, Mendeley and Zotero (the three reference managers I use) support citations to the biological databases ENA, PDB and Uniprot and what is missing</li>
<li>look at existing aggregators of this information (e.g. <a href="http://identifiers.org/">Identifiers.org</a>) to figure out whether the import process can be simplified</li>
<li>start work on Zotero <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/translators/coding#web_translators">web translators</a> for these three databases. Zotero is open source software and the web translators are written in Javascript</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact me if you are interested in helping with this, e.g. with a joint virtual hackathon on the 18th (or in person in London or Cambridge on October 15 if that works better).</p>
<p>Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMulvany">Ian Mulvany</a> from eLife and others from Papers and Mendeley we have also submitted a proposal for a pre-conference workshop/hackathon for the <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015">Force2015 Conference</a> in January to work on this for a broader set of databases, which should for example also include software repositories. One question is how we properly handle the citation of large numbers of datasets (1000s to millions), we could for example allow a range of identifiers in a citation. We also need tools to convert identifiers and links in existing documents to proper references, something that we <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/citations-in-markdown-part-3/">have also discussed on this blog</a>, and we need to discuss how our bibliographic file formats (e.g. bibtex) support these citation types. I <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/citeproc-yaml-for-bibliographies/">said before</a> that I am a big fan of Citeproc YAML (or JSON, the bibliographic format used by CSL) as bibliographic exchange format, and I know that the PLOS Labs hackathon will also touch on this.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>While adding reference manager support for a wider range of citations is the first step, the bigger challenge is community support. I don’t think that it is a big mental jump for an author to use the reference manager to cite a biological database rather than typing in the identifier directly in the text (the hard work is registering the identifier in the first place), but this needs support by the community, and in particular journal editors. The important message is that citations should be done in a consistent way and authors don’t have to think about doing this differently for datasets or other relevant resources, or different publishers implementing this differently. I think the paper by Kafkas et al. (2013) clearly shows that our current recommendations for adding identifiers to biological databases is broken, and that we need to do something if we take data citation seriously.</p>
<p>There are several concerns about adding every citation to the references list. One of them is that we shouldn’t mix citations of scholarly articles with citations of other things, e.g. research data. I would argue that not only are we seeing an increasing number of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2011.10.002">citations to other resources in reference lists</a>, but that we can of course group citations by citation type, in addition to the sorting by appearance in the text or last name of first author that is common now.</p>
<p>Another concern is that citations of datasets are something else that citations to scholarly articles, because the former are typically citations of content created by the same group of people at the time the journal article was also created. I would argue that again we can highlight this by how we display the references, and that I hope that this changes once data citation becomes more widespread.</p>
<p>What should or should not be cited in a scholarly document is of course a big discussion topic. What I am arguing is that everything that is cited should go into the references list, but that doesn’t change at all what should be cited. Personal communications are an example of something that should probably not be cited and therefore should also not go into the references list.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Doing scientific research is becoming increasingly complex, both in terms of the tools and technologies used, and in the collaboration across disciplines and locations that is increasingly commonplace. While the way we write up and publish research is of course also very different from 25 years ago, I would argue that our tools and services haven’t quite evolved at the same pace.</p>
<p>Of course there are important trends that enable what the Royal Institution <a href="https://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/Report/">calls</a> <em>Science as an Open Enterprise</em>, most importantly Open Access, which has broken down many barriers for open collaboration. But very few organizations - commercial or non-profit - see it as their primary mission to make it easier for researchers to collaborate and produce great science, in the sense that everything else is secondary and this focus is really obvious to everyone.</p>
<p>The following are just some examples that make you laugh hard or cry out loud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding relevant scholarly content. Why is still so hard?</li>
<li>Reading a paper. The majority of scholalry content is still not Open Access. It is embarassing how difficult it can be to get the fulltext paper from a subscription journal - too slow, too expensive, and sometimes even crippled in functionality.</li>
<li>Creating figures for publication. This process is still so painful that it hurts. And publishers often create artificial limitations in file type (TIFF or Postscript) and file size (10 MB??).</li>
<li>Licenses for scholarly content. We don’t need choice, but a few licenses that everyone understands and that don’t hinder sharing and collaboration</li>
<li>Secure login. I can use my Facebook or Google login almost everywhere, but as a scholar I have a different username and password at my institution, funder, the various publishers I submit too, and the scholarly services I frequently use?</li>
<li>Citation styles. Why do we still have at least 3,000 styles?</li>
</ul>
<p>Citation styles is a perfect example of a problem that should have been solved as soon as we made the switch to digital publishing. I can travel through half of Europe without showing my passport, and using the same currency, but I need to reformat citations every time I submit to a different journal? And I have to use the same tool for this as my coauthors, as the different reference managers don’t work with each other?</p>
<p>Too often there are other intentions at work in parallel. While notable, they sometimes stand in conflict with the goal of making a researcher’s life easier. A perfect example is the manuscript submission process. In parallel to the tools getting better and easier to use, the demands on the author seem to be increasing at an even greater rate, both in the data and metadata he or she should provide, and in the work submitting authors are asked to do that traditionally have been done by publishers. Another good example are peer review and evaluation. The proportion of time spent doing research vs. time spent doing administrative work seems to decreasing and not increasing.</p>
<p>I wish more people and organizations would stand up and state that keeping it simple is their primary goal.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the important outcomes of the <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki">Markdown for Science</a> workshop that took place in June 2013 was a decision on a name - <em>Scholarly Markdown</em> - and a brief <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">definition</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Markdown that supports the requirements of scientific texts</li>
<li>Markdown as format that glues open scientific text resources together</li>
<li>A reference implementation with documentation and tests</li>
<li>A community</li>
</ol>
<p>In my eyes this is still a great definition. And this week something important happened that is very relevant for Scholarly Markdown. A small group of people deeply involved in Markdown announced <a href="http://commonmark.org/">Standard Markdown</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
We propose a standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown, along with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown implementations against this specification. We believe this is necessary, even essential, for the future of Markdown.
</blockquote>
<p>Markdown is in widespread use, but a lack of standard syntax and set of comprehensive tests has hindered the adoption for more complex use cases, the development of cross-platform tools, and the use of markdown as a document interchange format. I am therefore 100% behind this initiative. In particular since this is not just an initiative by large commercial organizations heavily using Markdown such as Stack Exchange, Github or Reddit, but that the entire spec and both reference implementations have been written by <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/">John MacFarlane</a>, the author of Pandoc, the universal document converter. Not only does Pandoc already support many of the features required by Scholarly Markdown (e.g. math and citations), but John is the Chair of the Department of Philosophy at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Markdown was developed in 2004 by John Gruber, and he <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/license">holds the rights</a> to the name Markdown. He didn’t want this initiative to use the name <strong><strong>Standard Markdown</strong></strong>, so the implementation was <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/">renamed</a> to <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>.</p>
<p>The consequences of all this for Scholarly Markdown?</p>
<ul>
<li>CommonMark focusses on the basic features of the language, but once the specification is agreed upon and implemented by a critical mass of tools, it is clear that there needs to be a standardized way to handle extensions of the language. This is both about features used by lots of people such as tables, but also functionality relevant only for scholarly content.</li>
<li>This brings us one gigantic step closer to a reference implementation and set of tests for Scholarly Markdown, as hopefully Scholarly Markdown can build upon the work by John and the CommonMark team.</li>
<li>The name Scholarly Markdown might not be a good idea going forward. We should either change the name to align with CommonMark, or we should come up with a totally different name, something that the screenwriters have done with <a href="http://fountain.io/">their</a> implementation of Markdown.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.</p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong><strong>git</strong></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff &quot;pandoc&quot;]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong><strong>distributed version control system</strong></strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong><strong>Github</strong></strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g. Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g. only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In July and August I attended the <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/">Open Knowledge Festival</a> and <a href="http://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Programme">Wikimania</a>. At both events I had many interesting discussions around open source tools for open access scholarly publishing, and I was part of a <a href="http://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/The_Full_OA_Stack_-_Open_Access_and_Open_Source">panel</a> on that topic at Wikimania last Sunday. Some of my thoughts were summarized in a blog post a few weeks ago (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/roads-not-stagecoaches/">Build Roads not Stagecoaches</a>). Today I am happy to announce the first public release of a tool that hopefully contributes to making publishing of open content a bit easier.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rakali/rakali.rb">Rakali</a> is a Ruby gem that acts as a wrapper for the <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> universal document converter. Pandoc is a wonderful tool to convert documents between file formats and supports many file formats and features important for scholarly publishing. Pandoc 1.13 was <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/releases.html">released</a> last Friday, and one of the most exciting new features is a reader for Microsoft Word (<code>docx</code>) documents. Pandoc has supported the conversion to <code>docx</code> for a while, but now you can use the most popular file format for writing scholarly documents and turn your <code>docx</code> files into HTML, PDF, LateX, markdown, or a number of other formats, making it much easier to collaborate, and to use <code>docx</code> with Pandoc in scholarly publishing workflows. A good example would be arXiv, which <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/submit#text">doesn’t support</a> <code>docx</code> for text submissions. Instead of turning it into PDF the manuscript can now be converted to LaTeX - the preferred file format at arXiv - before submission.</p>
<p>I built <strong><strong>Rakali</strong></strong> to make it easier to use Pandoc to convert large numbers of documents in an automated way:</p>
<ul>
<li>bulk conversion of all files in a folder with a specific extension, e.g. <code>md</code>.</li>
<li>input via a configuration file in yaml format instead of via the command line</li>
<li>validation of documents via <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, using the <a href="https://github.com/hoxworth/json-schema">json-schema</a> Ruby gem.</li>
<li>Logging via <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One interesting way to use Rakali and Pandoc is as part of a <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/continuous-publishing/">continuous publishing</a> workflow that involves git and Github, automatically converting all files in a folder when something is pushed to the repository using a continuous integration tool, and exiting the continuous integration run when one of the files doesn’t validate. Look into the Rakali <a href="https://github.com/rakali/rakali.rb">repo</a> for an example.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of Rakali is probably validation via JSON Schema. File conversion with Pandoc is a two-step process, the intermediate format is an internal representation of the document in something called the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/the-grammar-of-scholarly-communication/">abstract syntax tree</a> or AST. Pandoc makes the AST accessible in JSON format, making it straightforward to manipulate a document before the conversion into the target format with something called <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html">JSON filters</a>.</p>
<p>Validation of XML documents using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">DTDs</a>, <a href="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a> and other standards has of course been around for a long time, but validation of JSON documents is still relatively new. Since many Pandoc document conversion workflows don’t involve any XML I thought it would make more sense to validate against the AST, and we can use JSON Schema for that. I have started a <a href="https://github.com/rakali/pandoc-schemata">Github repository</a> with schemata for the Pandoc AST, and hope to evolve them over time using Rakali as a tool. An example log output (from the Rakali test suite, stopping file conversion because title and layout metadata are missing) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Validation Error: The property &#39;#/0/unMeta&#39; did not contain a required property of &#39;title&#39; in schema 9b6d454d-e609-537b-b761-9599b6c01072# for file empty.md
Validation Error: The property &#39;#/0/unMeta&#39; did not contain a required property of &#39;layout&#39; in schema 9b6d454d-e609-537b-b761-9599b6c01072# for file empty.md
Fatal: Conversion of file empty.md failed.</code></pre>
<p>As I had argued before, the challenge for building open source tools for science is to <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/dont-reinvent-the-wheel/">not duplicate the work of others</a>, and to integrate well with existing tools by focussing on one aspect and doing that aspect well. It also helps to think about infrastructure (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/roads-not-stagecoaches/">the roads</a>) instead of only focussing on the user-facing aspects. There are obviously many document conversion tools out there, but Pandoc is certainly one of the oldest and most established ones for scholarly content. Rakali therefore builds on top of Pandoc and tries to play well with other existing tools and services, e.g. by using the UNIX <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> for reporting, and by using a file-based approach that works well with version control systems such as git. And since Rakali is a Ruby gem it can not only be used as a standalone command line tool, but can also be easily integrated into other Ruby applications.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One topic I will cover this Sunday in a presentation on <a href="http://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/Open_Scholarship_Tools_-_a_whirlwind_tour.">Open Scholarship Tools</a> at <em>Wikimania 2014</em> together with <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmulvany">Ian Mulvany</a> is visualization.</p>
<p>Data visualization is all about <em>telling stories with data</em>, something that is of course not only important for scholarly content, but for example increasingly common in journalism. This is a big and complex topic, but I hope the following will get you started.</p>
<h3 id="learn-the-basics">Learn the Basics</h3>
<p>Work on visualization of scientific data should start with a good understanding of the best practices and pitfalls of data visualization in general, as well as the specific aspects of visualizing scientific data. The following resources have helped me get started - please suggest more in the comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://book.flowingdata.com/">Visualize this</a>. A book from Nathan Yau published in 2011. Very helpful in understanding the different ways data can be visualized (e.g. when to use a treemap or what is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">chloropleth map</a>), and an introduction to some tools using practical examples. Nathan’s <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">FlowingData</a> blog is also a great resource.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery">D3 Gallery</a>. Lots of examples generated using Mike Bostock’s d3.js visualization library. A great inspiration for data visualization on the web, even if you use a different visualization tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html">ggplot2</a>. Not only a very popular visualization library for the R language by Hadley Wickham, but also an implementation of Leland Wilkison’s Grammar of Graphics. The <a href="http://www.springer.com/statistics/computational+statistics/book/978-0-387-98140-6">ggplot2 book</a> describes this powerful concept (p. 14):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
In brief, the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system. Faceting can be used to generate the same plot for different subsets of the dataset. It is the combination of these independent components that make up a graphic.
</blockquote>
<h3 id="learn-to-use-at-least-one-visualization-tool">Learn to use at least one visualization tool</h3>
<p>There are many great tools available, pick one and learn it well. Some options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Excel</strong></strong>. Probably the most popular tool for data visualization. Commercial, with open source alternatives such as Libre Office.</li>
<li><strong><strong>R</strong></strong>. Software for statistical computing and analysis. Open source. <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> is a powerful user interface for R and a good way to get started.</li>
<li><a href="http://d3js.org/"><strong>d3.js</strong></a>. A visualization library for Javascript. Open source.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/"><strong>Prism</strong></a>. A popular visualization tool among scientists. Commercial.</li>
<li><a href="https://datawrapper.de/"><strong>Datawrapper</strong></a>. An open source tool and hosted service for data visualization.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do most visualizations in either R or d3.js. Both are open source tools with a large community and a rich set of libraries, examples and documentation, and both take a systematic approach to data visualization (see grammar of graphics above).</p>
<h3 id="learn-data-analysis">Learn data analysis</h3>
<p>Unless your interest is more in information design - see <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/">Information is beautiful</a> for some great examples - data visualization is tightly coupled with data analysis. You need to know at least the basics of data analysis to do proper data visualizations, e.g. how to handle wrongly formatted data (e.g. text in a number column), missing values and outliers. The most time-consuming step in my experience is data transformation, i.e. bringing data into the format that you want for the analysis and visualization.</p>
<p>R, Python and the relatively new <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> are popular languages for data analysis available as open source. There are many packages for these languages that help with common data analysis problems. One additional advantage of using a proper language over a set of tools cobbled together is that it is easy to automatically recreate a visualization with a new set of data - convenient when you need to analyze and visualize an ongoing experiment that repeatedly produces new data.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-vector-file-format">Use a vector file format</h3>
<p>Too many scientific data are still visualized using bitmap graphic formats such as <code>tiff</code>, <code>jpg</code> and <code>png</code>. These formats are not appropriate for charts and only make sense for images. They don’t scale to the screen resolution, and it is <a href="http://blog.f1000research.com/2014/02/20/the-importance-of-providing-data-and-not-just-images-of-data/">very hard to impossible</a> to reuse or even modify them. Use vector graphic formats such as <code>svg</code> or <code>pdf</code> instead. <code>svg</code> is my preferred format because in contrast to <code>pdf</code> it can be embedded into a larger HTML document, and R and d3.js (my preferred visualization tools) can generate this format. <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> is an open source SVG editor, and the commercial <strong><strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong></strong> can be used to manually polish graphics in <code>svg</code> or <code>pdf</code> format, e.g. for journal publication.</p>
<h3 id="get-inspired-by-great-visualizations">Get inspired by great visualizations</h3>
<p>At the end of the day data visualization is all about telling a story with data. Unfortunately the current state of affairs for scientific visualizations is very different. In my opinion most graphs and figures used in publications don’t provide the data underlying the visualization (<a href="https://datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> is a great example how this can be done), focus too much on detail rather than the overall message, don’t take advantage of the different chart types available, and are sometimes even misleading. And I’m not even talking about the fact that figures in scholarly papers are <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1">almost never</a> interactive. It rarely happens that I read a paper and get excited by looking at a figure - if I do it is usually because the underlying data are so compelling that even the simplest visualization will convey the right message.</p>
<p>We should become more creative with visualizing data in scholarly documents, and one important step towards that goal is publishers accepting more reasonable file formats in manuscript submissions - instead of just <code>tiff</code> and <code>eps</code> (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/figureGuidelines#figures">PLOS</a>), or <code>tiff</code>, <code>eps</code> and <code>pdf</code> (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo/prep/prep_revfigs.xhtml#format">Science</a>), and often with a 10 MB file site limit.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Sunday <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmulvany">Ian Mulvany</a> and I will do a presentation on <a href="http://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/Open_Scholarship_Tools_-_a_whirlwind_tour.">Open Scholarship Tools</a> at <em>Wikimania 2014</em> in London. From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
This presentation will give a broad overview of tools and standards that are helping with Open Scholarship today.
</blockquote>
<p>One of the four broad topics we have picked are <em>digital object identifiers (DOI)s</em>. We want to introduce them to people new to them, and we want to show some tricks and cool things to people who already now them. Along the way we will also try to debunk some myths about DOIs.</p>
<h3 id="what-a-doi-looks-like">What a DOI looks like</h3>
<p>DOIs - or better DOI names - start with a prefix in the format <code>10.x</code> where x is 4-5 digits. The suffix is determined by the organization registering the DOI, and there is no consistent pattern across organizations. The DOI name is typically expressed as a URL (see below). An example DOI would look like: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345678">http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345678</a>. Something in the format <strong><strong>10/hvx</strong></strong> or <a href="http://doi.org/hvx">http://doi.org/hvx</a> is a <a href="http://shortdoi.org/">shortDOI</a>, and <strong><strong>1721.1/26698</strong></strong> or <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/26698">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/26698</a> is a handle. BTW, all DOIs names are also handles, so <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10/hvx">http://hdl.handle.net/10/hvx</a> for the shortDOI example above will resolve correctly.</p>
<h3 id="dois-are-persistent-identifiers">DOIs are persistent identifiers</h3>
<p>Links to resources can change, particularly over long periods of time. Persistent identifiers are needed so that readers can still find the content we reference in a scholarly work (or anything else where persistent linking is important) 10 or 50 years later. There are many kinds of persistent identifiers, one of the key concepts - and a major difference to URLs - is to separate the identifier for the resource from its location. Persistent identifiers require technical infrastructure to resolve identifiers (DOIs use the <a href="http://www.handle.net/">Handle System</a>) and to allow long-term archiving of resources. DOI registration agencies such as DataCite or CrossRef are required to provide that persistence. Other persistent identifier schemes besides DOIs include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PURL">persistent uniform resource locators (PURLs)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archival_Resource_Key">Archival Resource Keys (ARKs)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dois-have-attached-metadata">DOIs have attached metadata</h3>
<p>All DOIs have metadata attached to them. The metadata are supplied by the resource provider, e.g. publisher, and exposed in services run by registration agencies, for example metadata search and content negotiation (see below). There is a minimal set of required metadata for every DOI, but beyond that, different registration agencies will use different metadata schemata, and most metadata are optional. Metadata are important to build centralized discovery services, making it easier to describe a resource, e.g. journal article citing another article. Some of the more recent additions to metadata schemata include persistent identifiers for people (<a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) and funding agencies (<a href="http://www.crossref.org/fundref/">FundRef</a>), and license information. The following API call will retrieve all publications registered with CrossRef that use a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> (and where this information has been provided by the publisher):</p>
<pre><code>http://api.crossref.org/funders/10.13039/100000001/works?filter=license.url:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US</code></pre>
<h3 id="dois-support-link-tracking">DOIs support link tracking</h3>
<p>Links to other resources are an important part of the metadata, and describing all citations between a large number scholarly documents is a task that can only really be accomplished by a central resource. To solve this very problem DOIs were invented and the CrossRef organization started around 15 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="not-every-doi-is-the-same">Not every DOI is the same</h3>
<p>The DOI system <a href="http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/1_Introduction.html">originated from an initiative by scholarly publishers</a> (first announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1997), with citation linking of journal articles its first application. This citation linking system is managed by <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a>, a non-profit member organization of scholarly publishers, and <a href="http://search.crossref.org/help/status">more than half</a> of the about <a href="http://www.doi.org/faq.html">100 million DOIs</a> that have been assigned to date are managed by them.</p>
<p>But many DOIs are assigned by one of the other 8 <a href="http://www.doi.org/RA_Coverage.html">registration agencies</a>. You probably know <a href="http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, but did you know that the <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/index_en.htm">Publications Office of the European Union (OP)</a> and the <a href="http://www.eidr.org/">Entertainment Identifier Registry (EIDR)</a> also assign DOIs? The distinction is important, because some of the functionality is a service of the registration agency - metadata search for example is offered by CrossRef (<a href="http://search.crossref.org/">http://search.crossref.org</a>) and DataCite (<a href="http://search.datacite.org/">http://search.datacite.org</a>), but you can’t search for a DataCite DOI in the CrossRef metadata search. There is an API to find out the registration agency behind a DOI so that you know what services to expect:</p>
<pre><code>http://api.crossref.org/works/10.6084/m9.figshare.821213/agency

{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;ok&quot;,
  &quot;message-type&quot;: &quot;work-agency&quot;,

<h3 id="dois-are-urls">DOIs are URLs</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.doi.org/faq.html">DOI names may be expressed as URLs (URIs) through a HTTP proxy server</a> - e.g. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345679">http://dx.doi.org/10.5555/12345679</a>, and this is how DOIs are typically resolved. For this reason the <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/doi_display_guidelines.htm">CrossRef DOI Display Guidelines</a> recommend that <em>CrossRef DOIs should always be displayed as permanent URLs in the online environment</em>. Because DOIs can be expressed as URLs, they also have their features:</p>
<h4 id="special-characters">Special characters</h4>
<p>Because DOIs can be expressed as URLs, DOIs <a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/15doi_guidelines.html">should only include characters allowed in URLs</a>, something that wasn’t always true in the past and can cause problems, e.g. when using SICIs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier">Serial Item and Contribution Identifier</a>), an extension of the ISSN for journals:</p>
<pre><code>10.4567/0361-9230(1997)42:&lt;OaEoSR&gt;2.0.TX;2-B</code></pre>
<h4 id="content-negotiation">Content negotiation</h4>
<p>The DOI resolver at <em>doi.org</em> (or <em>dx.doi.org</em>) normally resolves to the resource location, e.g. a landing page at a publisher website. Requests that are not for content type <code>text/html</code> are redirected to the registration agency metadata service (currently for CrossRef, DataCite and mEDRA DOIs). Using <a href="http://www.crosscite.org/cn/">content negotiation</a>, we can ask the metadata service to send us the metadata in a format we specify (e.g. Citeproc JSON, bibtex or even a formatted citation in one of thousands of citation styles) instead of getting redirected to the resource. This is a great way to collect bibliographic information, e.g. to format citations for a manuscript. In theory we could also use content negotiation to get a particular representation of a resource, e.g. <code>application/pdf</code> for a PDF of a paper or <code>text/csv</code> for a dataset in CSV format. This is not widely support and I don’t know the details of the implementation in the DOI resolver, but you can try this (content negotation is easier with the command line than with a browser):</p>
<pre><code>curl -LH &quot;Accept: application/pdf&quot; http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500 &gt;peerj.500.pdf</code></pre>
<p>This will save the PDF of the 500th PeerJ paper published last week.</p>
<h4 id="fragment-identifiers">Fragment identifiers</h4>
<p>As discussed in <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/fragment-identifiers-and-dois/">my last blog post</a>, we can use fragment identifiers to subsections of a document with DOIs, e.g. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2</a> or <a href="http://doi.org/10.5446/12780#t=00:20,00:27">http://doi.org/10.5446/12780#t=00:20,00:27</a>, just as we can with every other URL. This is a nice way to directly link to a specific document section, e.g. when discussing a paper on Twitter. Fragment identifiers are implemented by the client (typically web browser) and depend on the document type, but for DOIs that resolve to full-text HTML documents they can add granularity to the DOI without much effort.</p>
<h4 id="queries">Queries</h4>
<p>URLs obviously support queries, but that is a feature I haven’t yet seen with DOIs. Queries would allow interesting features, partly overlapping with what is possible with fragment identifiers and content negotiation, e.g. <code>http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500?format=pdf</code>. II hope to find out more until Sunday.</p>
<h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3>
<p>My biggest wish? Make DOIs more machine-readable. They are primarily intended for human users, enabling them to find the content associated with a DOI. But they sometimes don’t work as well as they could with automated tools, one example are the <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/broken-dois/">challenges automatically resolving a DOI</a> that I described in a blog post last year. Thinking about DOIs as URLs - and using them this way - is the right direction.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before all our content turned digital, we already used <strong><strong>page numbers</strong></strong> to describe a specific section of a book or longer document, with older manuscripts using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio">folio</a> before that. Page numbers have transitioned to electronic books with readers such as the Kindle <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/page-numbers-for-kindle-books-an-imperfect-solution/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">supporting them eventually</a>.</p>

<p>For content on the web we can use the <code>#</code> fragment identifier, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals</a> to navigate to a specific section of a web page. How the linking to this fragment is handled, depends on the <strong><strong>MIME</strong></strong> type of the document, and will for example be done differently for a text page than a video - YouTube understands minutes and seconds into a video as fragment identifier, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UNRZEsLxKc#t=54m52s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UNRZEsLxKc#t=54m52s</a>. Fragment identifiers are not only helpful to link to a subsection of a document, but of course also for navigation within a document.</p>
<p>All this is of course very relevant to scholarly content, which is usually much more structured, with most journal articles following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD">IMRAD</a> - introduction, methods, results, and discussion - format, usually with additional sections such as abstract, references, etc. One approach to link to figures and tables within a scholarly articles is using <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">component DOIs</a>, e.g. specific DOIs for parts of a larger document. The publisher <strong><strong>PLOS</strong></strong> has been using them for a long time, and the <a href="https://editor.front-matter.io/2014/07/24/dont-reinvent-the-wheel/">number of component DOIs is rising</a>, but most scholarly journal articles don’t use component DOIs. And whereas component DOIs are a great concept for content such as figures (allowing us to describe the MIME type and other relevant metadata), they are probably not the best tool to link to a section or paragraph of a scholarly document.</p>
<p>As it turns out, we already have a tool for that, as the DOI proxy server gracefully forwards fragment identifiers (how did I miss this?). We can therefore use a DOI with a fragment identifier to</p>
<ul>
<li>Results section: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2</a></li>
<li>Specific reference: <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1#ref-7">http://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1#ref-7</a></li>
<li>Decision letter: <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471#decision-letter">http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471#decision-letter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this only works if the DOI is resolved to the full-text of a resource, and not a landing page. And how the fragment identifiers are named and implemented is up to the publisher, and the DOI resolver has no information about them. These specific links are particularly nice for discussions of a paper, whether it is on Twitter or in a discussion forum. It appears that at least the Twitter link shortener keeps the fragment identifier, the link to the eLife decision letter is shortened to <a href="http://t.co/URWaYmGHnY">http://t.co/URWaYmGHnY</a>. This kind of linking works particularly well if the publisher is using a fine-grained system of fragment identifiers, the publisher PeerJ for example allows links to a specific paragraph - e.g. <a href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500#p-15">http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500#p-15</a> - and allows users to <a href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/62886292466/peerj-questions-a-new-way-to-never-publish-forget">ask a question</a> right next to that section.</p>
<p>The examples above all use MIME type <code>text/html</code>, as this is what the example DOIs resolve to by default. I don’t if and how publishers have implemented fragment identifiers for other formats such as PDF or ePub, and what happens if you combine fragment identifiers with <a href="http://www.crosscite.org/cn/">content negotiation</a>. The shortDOI service works with fragment identifiers as well: <a href="http://doi.org/pxd#decision-letter">http://doi.org/pxd#decision-letter</a>. Another interesting question would be how fragment identifiers are handled for datasets. Typically separate DOIs are assigned for multiple related datasets, but there could also be a place for fragment identifiers as well, e.g. to specify a subset via a date range. The solution depends again on the content type, and the popular <code>text/csv</code> is unfortunately not well suited for this, whereas JSON – using <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON Pointer</a> – would work well.</p>
<p><em>Update 8/2/14: <a href="https://twitter.com/ldodds">Leigh Dodds</a> points out that handling the fragment identifier is up to the client and the fragment identifier is not sent to the server. Acrobat reader for example supports the <code>#page=</code> fragment identifier. He also mentions that there is a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111">RFC7111</a> for fragment identifiers for the text/csv media type - browsers in the future might support something like <code>http://example.com/data.csv#row=5-7</code>.</em></p>

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday 60 years ago the first volume of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy by <em>J.R.R. Tolkien</em> was published. The quote above obviously doesn’t quiet apply to scholarly publishing, but one recurring theme that I have often heard in the last few years is that of a need for a canonical digital document format for scholarly content that rules all other formats.</p>
<figure>
<img src="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/rings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Document formats in scholarly Publishing" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Document formats in scholarly Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A few years ago almost everyone you would have said that <code>xml</code> is that format, with the NLM Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite - which has evolved into <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">JATS</a> - probably the most commonly used Document Type Definition (DTD). <code>xml</code> does many things really well, but also has important shortcomings, most importantly that it is probably not a good format for authors (and don’t tell me that <code>docx</code> and <code>odt</code> are XML-based). We therefore don’t really expect authors to submit manuscripts in JATS <code>xml</code>, but rather convert documents into this format after a manuscript has been accepted for publication. This conversion step is often time-consuming and labor-intensive.</p>
<p>More recently <code>html</code> has become the most interesting candidate for a canonical scholarly document format. The big advantage over <code>xml</code> is that <code>html</code> - or at least <code>html5</code> which is most popular today - is an attractive format for online authoring tools (that is why <code>html</code> is listed both as input and output format) The downside of this flexibility is that it is much harder to embed structure and metadata into <code>html5</code> compared to <code>xml</code>. There are initiatives such as <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook">HTMLBook</a> that hope to change that, but we aren’t quite there yet.</p>
<p>Or maybe we should learn from Tolkien and give up on the idea of a canonical document format and rather spend our energy on building tools that make it easier to transition from one format to another. <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> is such as tool, but can’t do all the required conversions, e.g. it can’t yet use <code>docx</code> as input. The downside here is that every file conversion runs the risk of loosing important information. But the increase in flexibility hopefully outweights these shortcomings.</p>

One important aspect of that infrastructure work is to not duplicate efforts.</p>

<p>A good example is information (or metadata) about scholarly publications. I am the technical lead for the open source <a href="http://articlemetrics.github.io/">article-level metrics (ALM) software</a>. This software can be used in different ways, but most people use it for tracking the metrics of scholarly articles, with articles that have DOIs issued by CrossRef. The ALM software needs three pieces of information for every article: <strong><strong>DOI</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>publication date</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>title</strong></strong>. This information can be entered via a web interface, but that is of course not very practical for adding dozens or hundreds of articles at a time. The ALM software has therefore long supported the import of multiple articles via a text file and the command line.</p>
<p>This approach is working fine for the ALM software <a href="http://articlemetrics.github.io/plos/">running at PLOS since 2009</a>, but is for example a problem if the ALM software runs as a service for multiple publishers. A more flexible approach is to provide an API to upload articles, and I’ve <a href="http://articlemetrics.github.io/docs/api/">added an API</a> for creating, updating and deleting articles in January 2014.</p>
<p>While the API is an improvement, it still requires the integration into a number of possibly very different publisher workflows, and you have to deal with setting up the permissions, e.g. so that publisher A can’t delete an article from publisher B.</p>
<p>The next ALM release (3.3) will therefore add a third approach to importing articles: using the <a href="http://api.crossref.org/">CrossRef API</a> to look up article information. Article-level metrics is about tracking already published works, so we really only care about articles that have DOIs registered with CrossRef and are therefore published. ALM is now talking to a single API, and this makes it much easier to do this for a number of publishers without writing custom code. Since ALM is an open source application already used by several publishers that aspect is important. And because we are importing, we have don’t have to worry about permissions. The only requirement is that CrossRef has the correct article information, and has this information as soon as possible after publication.</p>
<p>At this point I have a confession to make: I regularly use other CrossRef APIs, but wasn’t aware of <strong><strong>api.crossref.org</strong></strong> until fairly recently. That is sort of understandable since the reference platform was deployed only September last year. The documentation to get you started is on <a href="https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md">Github</a> and the version history shows frequent API updates (now at v22). The API will return all kinds of information, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>how many articles has publisher x published in 2012</li>
<li>percentage of DOIs of publisher Y that include at least one ORCID identifier</li>
<li>list all books with a Creative Commons CC-BY license that were published this year</li>
</ul>
<p>Funder (via FundRef) information is also included, but is still incomplete. Another interesting result is the number of <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">component DOIs</a> (DOIs for figures, tables or other parts of a document) per year:</p>
<p>For my specific use case I wanted an API call that returns all articles published by PLOS (or any other publisher) in the last day which I can then run regularly. To get all DOIs from a specific publisher, use their CrossRef member ID - DOI prefixes don’t work, as publishers can own more than one DOI prefix. To make this task a little easier I built a CrossRef member search interface into the ALM application:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/crossref_api.png" class="kg-image" width="1170" height="774" />
</figure>
<p>We can filter API responses by publication date, but it is a better idea to use the update date, as it is possible that the metadata have changed, e.g. a correction of the title. We also want to increase the number of results per page (using the <code>rows</code> parameter). The final API call for all DOIs updated by PLOS since the beginning of the week would be</p>
<pre><code>http://api.crossref.org/members/340/works?filter=from-update-date:2014-07-21,until-update-date:2014-07-24&amp;rows=1000</code></pre>
<p>The next step is of course to parse the JSON of the API response, and you will notice that CrossRef is using <a href="http://gsl-nagoya-u.net/http/pub/citeproc-doc.html">Citeproc JSON</a>. This is a standard JSON format for bibliographic information used internally by several reference managers for citation styles, but increasingly also by APIs and other places where you encounter bibliographic information.</p>
<p>Citeproc JSON is helpful for one particular problem with CrossRef metadata: the exact publication date for an article is not always known, and CrossRef (and similarly DataCite) only requires the publication year. Citeproc JSON can nicely handle partial dates, e.g. year-month:</p>
<pre><code>issued: {
  date-parts: [
    [
      2014,
      7
    ]
  ]
},</code></pre>
<p>I think that a similar approach will work for many other systems that require bibliographic information about scholarly content with CrossRef DOIs. If are not already using <strong><strong>api.crossref.org</strong></strong>, consider integrating with it, I find the API fast, well documented, easy to use - and CrossRef is very responsive to feedback. As you can always wish for more, I would like to see the following: fix the problem were some journal articles are missing the publication date (a required field, even if only the year), and consider adding the canonical URL to the article metadata (which ALM currently has to look up itself, and which is needed to track social media coverage of an article).</p>

<p>Of all the things that were discussed I want to pick one theme that resonated in particular with me. It surfaced in many places, but was articulated particularly well by <a href="https://twitter.com/erichysen">Eric Hysen</a> - who heads the <a href="http://www.google.com/elections/ed/us">Google Politics &amp; Elections Group</a> - in his keynote yesterday (starting at 54:52, but please also watch the keynote by Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission):</p>
<p>In his keynote he described how travel from Cambridge to London in the 18th and early 19th century improved mainly as a result of better roads, made possible by changes in how these roads were financed. Translated to today, he urged the audience to think more about the infrastructure and less about the end products:</p>
<blockquote>
Ecosystems, not apps – Eric Hysen
</blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday at <a href="http://csvconf.com/#nickstenning">csv,conf</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickstenning">Nick Stenning</a> - Technical Director of the Open Knowledge Foundation - talked about <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/">data packages</a>, an evolving standard to describe data that are passed around betwen different systems. He used the metaphor of containers, and how they have dramatically changed the transportation of goods in the last 50 years. He <a href="https://github.com/nickstenning/put-it-in-a-box">argued</a> that the cost of shipping was in large part determined by the cost of loading and unloading, and the container has dramatically changed that equation. We are in a very similar situation with datasets, where most of the time is spent translating between different formats, joining things together that use different names for the same thing, etc.</p>

<p>What the two presentations have in common is not only that they link the building of an open digital infrastructure to important transforming events in the history of transportation, but also the emphasis on the building blocks rather than the finished product. When I thought more about this I realized that these building blocks are exactly the projects I get most excited about, i.e. projects that develop standards or provide APIs or libraries. Some examples would be</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>: unique identifiers for scholarly authors</li>
<li><a href="http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a>: a language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies</li>
<li><a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>: a universal document converter</li>
<li><a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>: packages for the statistical programming language R to access data repositories</li>
<li><a href="http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/altmetrics_initiative/">NISO Alternative Assessment Metrics</a>: standards and best practices for novel scholarly metrics</li>
<li><a href="http://www.re3data.org/">re3data</a>: a registry of research data repositories</li>
<li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>: copyright licenses for creative works</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">ALM</a>: software to collect comprehensive information about the discussion of scholarly articles on the web</li>
</ul>
<p>This list doesn’t include all the generic software needed to build open science tools, with <strong>git</strong> being a perfect example. The last project is obviously the project I have been working on the past two years for PLOS, but I have tried to support the other projects mentioned in various ways from small code contributions to promotion via this blog and presentations, or direct work in these projects. But strangely enough, I haven’t really realized this until now.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly infrastructure, servers, libraries and other building blocks are exactly the areas where open source software has been most successful so far, and this is of course a core part of the UNIX philosophy of building parts that work well together rather than big monolithic programs that do everything.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>We need more <strong><strong>Open Science Infrastructure</strong></strong> and it is the stuff that I really care about. I think we need to better support those projects that build these essential building blocks via advice, cooperation, promotion, and financial support. I am willing to help with that effort, and I have started to think how I can best contribute.</p>
<p>On the other hand there are many great open science projects that don’t fall in this category, maybe even the majority of them. I wish them good luck, but I would advice them to think more about infrastructure, and whether there is a small area where they can focus on. It still amazes me how successful projects such as <strong><strong>Citation Style Language</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Pandoc</strong></strong> have been with no or almost no funding and a very small core group of people doing the majority of the work. One critical ingredient is the total focus on a very specific problem that is both important and can be solved with specific actions. Too many open science projects want to solve too many problems at once, try to solve the exact same problems that many other parallel projects work on, don’t cooperate enough with those parallel projects, and require a critical mass of users to work.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the World Wide Web.
</blockquote>
<p>Literate Programming by <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/">Donald Knuth</a> (1983) is a seminal book that introduces the concept of literate programming. Using technology available in 2014 we can make a small but important change to the last sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
The program is also viewed as a hypertext document on the World Wide Web.
</blockquote>
<p>This blog post is an example for such a document. The page is written in <strong><strong>markdown</strong></strong> (markdown file available <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/mfenner.github.io/blob/source/_posts/2014-04-04-literate-blogging.Rmd">here</a>), and all embedded code was executed when this page was generated, i.e. when the markdown was converted to HTML and the blog post was published. To demonstrate this I have embedded code in three different languages below - the output is the second code block.</p>
<p>In R you have</p>
<pre><code>cat(&#39;Hello, R world!\n&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hello, R world!</code></pre>
<p>Or Python</p>
<pre><code>print &quot;Hello, Python world!&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hello, Python world!</code></pre>
<p>Or Ruby</p>
<pre><code>puts &#39;Hello, Ruby world!&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hello, Ruby world!</code></pre>
<p>You can also embed code within text blocks (inline), so that <code>3.48 * 723</code> becomes <strong><strong>2516.04</strong></strong>. Another important option is to generate figures using the embedded code, e.g. the following figure taken from a recent publication.</p>
<pre><code># code for figure 1: density plots for citation counts for PLOS Biology

<p>All this functionality is provided by <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>, a package for the R statistical programming language. knitr has been around for a while, but integration into the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blogging platform is still fragile. Earlier this week at the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/hackathon">rOpenSci hackathon</a> (more on this later) a group of us worked hard to improve this integration. We are still not completely done, but the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/docs">here</a>. Most importantly, all the conversion happens on the server, and we are only using freely available tools. I have now enabled this functionality for this blog, so expect more code embedded examples in the future.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week Björn Brembs wrote in a blog post (<a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/2014/03/what-is-the-difference-between-text-data-and-code/">What Is The Difference Between Text, Data And Code?</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
To sum it up: our intellectual output today manifests itself in code, data and text.
</blockquote>
<p>The post is about the importance of publication of data and software where currently <em>the rewards are stacked disproportionately in favor of text publications</em>. The intended audience is probably mainly other scientists (Björn is a neurobiologist) who are reluctant to publish data and/or code, but there is another interesting aspect to this.</p>
<p>Just as scientific publication increasingly means more than just text and includes data and software, we are also increasingly seeing tools and methodologies common in software development applied to scientific publishing. This in particular includes the ideas behind Open Source software (which shares many commonalities with Open Access and Open Science), but also tools like the git version control system (<a href="http://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science/">We Need a Github of Science</a>) or the markdown markdown language (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">A Call for Scholarly Markdown</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>Continuous Delivery is another concept increasingly popular in software development that has many implications on how research can be performed and reported. Martin Fowler describes it as:</p>
<blockquote>
Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of frequent small releases is of course familiar to everyone practicing <a href="http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/">Open Notebook Science</a>, writing science blogs, presenting preliminary data at conferences or publishing <a href="http://arxiv.org/">preprints</a>, and is even relevant to <a href="http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/">CrossMark</a>, a service that tracks corrections, enhancements and other changes of scholarly documents.</p>
<p>When you read the definition given by Martin Fowler carefully, you see that Continuous Delivery is about more than the frequency of software updates – it is in fact about improving the process of releasing software. The scientific publication is the corresponding event in science, and I think that nobody would argue with me that the experience publishing a paper is too complex, time-consuming and often frustrating. The focus here is not on the time it takes to do peer review, or the multiple revisions needed before a manuscript is accepted. I am talking about the pain submitting a manuscript, the back and forth regarding file formats, citation styles and other technical requirements, the reformatting of manuscripts, and also the time it takes from accepting a manuscript to finally publishing it online.</p>
<p>I would argue that the main reason publishing is so painful for everyone involved is that it is still very much a manual process. Just as software development is creative work, but still can benefit tremendously from tools such as automated tests and build tools, we can apply the same principles to scientific publishing. This means that everything that can be automated should be automated so that we can focus on those areas that need human judgement. The mistake that I think is commonly made is that automation for many publishers means automation for the publisher, with even more work for the author who submits a manuscript. A good example is that authors are increasingly asked to submit publication-ready manuscripts even though typesetting and desktop publishing is not their area of expertise and the manuscript text will be very different after one or more rounds of revision. The pain of processing manuscripts into something that can be published was summarized perfectly by typesetter and friend Kaveh Bazargan at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=CGkcsvofjdg">SpotOn London 2012 Conference</a> (via <a href="http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/11/19/yet-another-solo12-recap-part2/">Ross Mounce’s blog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
It’s madness really. I’m here to say I shouldn’t be in business.
</blockquote>
<p>The promise of Continuous Delivery for publishing is to develop tools and best practices that make the process of publication faster, with better quality, and less frustrating. Continuous Integration (<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">again Martin Fowler</a>) is an important part of Continuous Delivery and means frequently merging all developer working copies of a software project into a central repository, combined with running automated unit tests and software builds using an integration server.</p>
<p>We can apply Continuous Integration to scholarly documents - instead of automated tests and software builds we can automate the transformation of documents into <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/from-markdown-to-jats-xml-in-one-step/">JATS XML</a> and other output formats, and we can automate the process of checking for required metadata, correct file formats for images, etc. And we can use the same software tools for this, many of which are freely available to Open Source projects.</p>
<p>As an example of how this can be done <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis">I have integrated</a> the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> Continuous Integration server with the book project <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/">Opening Science</a>. The recently published book is a dynamic book that hopefully is updated frequently in the coming months. Every time an editor approves a correction to the text - <a href="https://github.com/openingscience/book">hosted in markdown format on Github</a> - the Travis CI server is automatically triggered to build a new HTML version of the book and to push the new version to the book website. The Travis server is running the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> document converter to not only convert the changed document from markdown to HTML, but Pandoc will also insert and format references, and the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site generator will build a nice website around the markdown files. Over time this build process can be extended to do other things as well, from <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">auto-generating links to data and resources</a> to transforming the document into <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/from-markdown-to-jats-xml-in-one-step/">other file formats</a> besides HTML.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had a little discussion on Twitter about a great blog post by Zach Holman: <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/only-90s-developers/">Only 90s Web Developers Remember This</a>. The post is not only fun to read, but also reminded me that it is now almost 20 years (1995) that I built my first website - of course using some of the techniques (the one pixel gif!, the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> tag!) described in the post.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/scriptwebtitle.gif" class="kg-image" width="250" height="50" alt="ScriptWeb logo 1995" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">ScriptWeb logo 1995</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We started ScriptWeb back in 1995 as a central resource for scripting on the Mac (AppleScript and Frontier). It was a nice collaborative effort and I was resposible for a directory of scripting additions (or osaxen), joining forces with MacScripter.net a few years later:</p>

</figure>
<p>Since then I have built many other websites for fun and work, adapting to how technology changed over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>1995: website running on a Mac Quadra 610 using the WebSTAR HTTP server and server side includes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">SSI</a>)</li>
<li>1995: static site generation with outline navigation using AppleScript. FTP to transfer files</li>
<li>1995: Visual HTML editors (Adobe PageMill 1.0)</li>
<li>1999: database server and application layer (too long ago to remember the technology)</li>
<li>2001: Open source database and application code with MySQL and PHP. CVS for version control</li>
<li>2001: web frameworks with PHP and MySQL: PostNuke and Xaraya</li>
<li>2005: more complex web application frameworks: Ruby on Rails. Subversion version control</li>
<li>2008: git for version control</li>
<li>2011: more complex frontend Javascript</li>
<li>2013: static site generator Jekyll</li>
</ul>
<p>Since last June this blog is running on Github pages and the site is generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll works really well to build static websites such as this blog, but I am increasingly using it for more complex projects, e.g. for the online version of a <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/">book on Open Science</a>.</p>
<p>What I find interesting in this timeline is that with Jekyll there is a shift in focus. Rather than building even more complex web pages that are generated dynamically by the server, we are going back to a two-stage process where the HTML pages are built first and then served as HTML, CSS and Javascript without any database or server application layer. Doesn’t sound too different from what we did in the 1990s. This approach obviously works well for content-heavy sites like this blog or book chapters, not so much for dynamically generated content that changes every few minutes, or where the page is put together from many different page fragments.</p>
<p>What I don’t know, and I am really interested to find out, is how well this scales to larger sites, specifically publisher websites that host thousands of scholarly journal articles - again content that is very text-heavy and doesn’t change that much. The potential benefits of replacing the paradigm of a database layer that holds all content with a paradigm that stores all content in files managed by git version control are clear: serving the content on the web becomes less complex, cheaper and faster. The tradeoff is of course that generating the static content becomes more complex and time-consuming, and it can become a challenge to mix the static content with dynamic content generated by servers as well as the user’s browser. For a now infamous example using this technology, look no further than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-pavley/obamacare-website-problems_b_4057618.html">Heathcare.gov</a>. I don’t know enough details to understand what went wrong, and it might have more to do with the scale of the project and the tight timeline to launch. For scholarly journal articles this might be a reasonable approach, as even when there is no longer a printed version of the journal, articles are still published on a specific date, and changing the content is a very formal process.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I want to talk about some of the misunderstandings I frequently encounter when discussing <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">markdown as a format for authoring scholarly documents</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scholars-will-always-use-microsoft-word">Scholars will always use Microsoft Word</h2>
<p>Microsoft Word is of course what almost all authors use in the life sciences and many other disciplines. One big reason for this is the file formats accepted my manuscript submission systems. By limiting the options to Microsoft Word (and maybe LaTeX), you make it impossible for authors to use other tools, even if they wanted to. Publishers should accept manuscripts in any reasonable file format, as I have <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/the-grammar-of-scholarly-communication/">argued before</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-markup-language-is-better-than-markdown">My markup language is better than markdown</h2>
<p>There are of course numerous alternatives to markdown, including <a href="http://txstyle.org/">Textile</a>, <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a>, <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting">MediaWiki Markup</a> and <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html">reStructuredText</a>. There will always be features that are better implemented in one of these languages, but I don’t think there is room for more than one major initiative for a scholarly markup language. And markdown has the right mix of features and broad support by tools and the community.</p>
<p>Related to this there is the argument against markdown that the format <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-future-of-markdown/">is a mess</a> and that there are too many versions (or flavors) of it. While that is certainly a big problem with markdown, I would argue that with <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> we have a nice standard and reference implementation for Scholarly Markdown. Pandoc is constantly evolving, and the addition of support for arbitrary YAML metadata was the biggest new feature in 2013 for me.</p>
<h2 id="scholarly-markdown-is-too-complex-and-we-might-as-well-use-latex">Scholarly Markdown is too complex and we might as well use LaTeX</h2>
<blockquote>
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation.<br />
The LaTeX Team, 2014

<p>Although LaTeX has solved many of the problems Scholarly Markdown tries to tackle a long time ago, it is still something else. LaTeX at its core is a typesetting system, which is not something Scholarly Markdown cares about for two reasons: a) the focus is on authoring documents, which are then submitted to other systems at publishers and elsewhere that are specialized in producing the final document, and b) the focus is on HTML and the web as this is where we want most of the interactions with scholarly documents to take place. This means that</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown is a great input format to convert into other formats, including XML (see for example my <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats">pandoc-jats</a>).</li>
<li>LaTeX will always be the best choice for some content, e.g. documents rich in mathematical formulas</li>
<li>If the ultimate goal was to produce high-quality PDF documents, Scholarly Markdown would be a bad choice. It is the right format for HTML and the related ePub.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have to be very careful that we keep the right balance of simplicity and features in Scholarly Markdown. This means that sometimes we should just include the LaTeX code, e.g. for math.</p>
<h2 id="scientists-need-a-wysiwyg-editor-and-then-the-file-format-doesn-t-matter">Scientists need a WYSIWYG Editor, and then the file format doesn’t matter</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> - What You See Is What You Get - is a user interface metaphor that is both a blessing and a curse. We desperately need better writing tools, and this of course also means user interfaces that help with that task. But the focus on creating a new authoring environment that focusses too much on WYSIWYG creates several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>WYSIWYG is not always a good metaphor for scholarly documents. Typographic features such as fonts, line spacing, etc. are not something that belong into an authoring environment - this is done during the publishing step, as is the formatting of references according to a specific citation style.</li>
<li>WYSIWYG is for human interactions, but content in scholarly documents is increasingly created by computers. Two good examples are statistics and figures created in <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">R/knitr</a> or <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">iPython Notebook</a>. Scholarly Markdown works perfectly with these workflows.</li>
<li>WYSIWYG authoring environments run the high risk of vendor lock-in. This is understandable if you run a startup and want to promote your tool, but is not in the best interest of the scholarly community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version control via git is central to Scholarly Markdown, and this can also be challenging for a WYSIWYG environment. But there are many good examples of how to make this work.</p>
<h2 id="scientists-should-submit-their-manuscripts-in-jats-xml-the-standard-format-for-scholarly-documents">Scientists should submit their manuscripts in JATS XML, the standard format for scholarly documents</h2>
<p>At the end of the day most scholarly publications in the life sciences are converted into JATS XML. Unfortunately central aspects of the format (e.g. the required document structure or required attributes) are difficult to enforce in an authoring environment. Even if you build a tool that can nicely handle this, I’m not so sure we want to burden an author with this, especially since the manuscript will usually undergo a lot of changes before it is accepted and then published.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-is-html">The future is HTML</h2>
<p>Although the future for consuming scholarly documents is clearly HTML (and ePub), and there are great HTML editors, I’m not so sure that HTML will become the default for authoring environments. This is the reason why markdown and related markup languages were invented, and even with modern WYSIWYG editors working directly with HTML is not always the best choice. HTML has two problems: a) it is not as human-readable as markdown and therefore requires an additional layer for authoring, and b) it is not as structured as XML, which makes it difficult to create some of the rigid document structure required for scholarly documents. O’Reilly is trying to get more structure into HTML for print and digital books with <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/htmlbook">HTMLBook</a>, but with too much structure you might run into similar problems for authoring as discussed above for JATS XML. And of course you can include HTML in markdown documents.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Journal Article Tag Suite (<a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/">JATS</a>) is a NISO standard that defines a set of XML elements and attributes for tagging journal articles. JATS is not only used for fulltext content at PubMed Central (and JATS has evolved from the NLM Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite originally developed for PubMed Central), but is also increasinly used by publishers.</p>
<p>For many publishers the <em>version of record</em> of an article is stored in XML, and other formats (currently HTML, PDF and increasingly ePub) are generated from this XML. Unfortunately the process of converting author-submitted manuscripts into JATS-compliant XML is time-consuming and costly, and this is a problem in particular for small publishers.</p>
<p>In a recent blog post (<a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/the-grammar-of-scholarly-communication/">The Grammar of Scholarly Communication</a>) I argued that publishers should accept manuscripts in any reasonable file format, including Microsoft Word, Open Office, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML and PDF. Readers of this blog know that I am a big fan of <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/tags.html#markdown-ref">markdown</a> for scholarly documents, but I am of course well aware that at the end of the day these documents have to be converted into JATS.</p>
<p>As a small step towards that goal I have today released the first public version of <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats">pandoc-jats</a>, a <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#custom-writers">custom writer for Pandoc</a> that converts markdown documents into JATS XML with a single command, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>pandoc -f example.md --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography=example.bib --csl=apa.csl -t JATS.lua -o example.xml</code></pre>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats">pandoc-jats</a> Github repository for more detailed information, but using this custom writer is as simple as downloading a single <code>JATS.lua</code>file. The big challenge is of course to make this custom writer work with as many documents as possible, and that will be my job the next few weeks. Two example JATS documents are below (both markdown versions of scholarly articles and posted on this blog as HTML):</p>
<ul>
<li>Nine simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/nine-simple-ways-to-make-it-easier-to-reuse-your-data/">HTML</a>, <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/files/10.7287.peerj.preprints.7v2.xml">JATS</a>)</li>
<li>What Can Article Level Metrics Do for You? (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/what-can-article-level-metrics-do-for-you/">HTML</a>, <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/files/10.1371.journal.pbio.1001687.xml">JATS</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both JATS files were validated against the JATS DTD and XSD and showed no errors with the NLM XML StyleChecker - using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/PeerJ/jats-conversion">jats-conversion</a> conversion and validation tools written by Alf Eaton. Markdown is actually a nice file format to convert to XML - in contrast to HTML authors can’t for example put closing tags at the wrong places. And a Pandoc custom writer written in the Lua scripting language is an interesting alternative to XSLT transformations, the more common way to create JATS XML. The custom writer has not been tested with other Pandoc input formats besides markdown, of particular interest are of course HTML and LaTeX - Microsoft Word .docx is unfortunately only a Pandoc output format.</p>
<p>This is the first public release and there is of course a lot of room for improvement. Many elements and attributes are not yet supported - although <a href="http://orcid.org/blog/2013/03/22/orcid-how-more-specifying-orcid-ids-document-metadata">ORCID author identifiers</a> are of course included.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In October I published an essay on Article-Level Metrics (ALM) in PLOS Biology (Fenner, 2013). The essay is a good introduction into Article-Level Metrics, and I am proud that it is part of the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/issue.pcol.v06.i03">Tenth Anniversary PLOS Biology Collection</a>. Like all PLOS content, the article was published with a <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/creative-commons-for-science-interview-with-puneet-kishor/">Creative Commons attribution license</a>, allowing me to republish the article on this blog. I have now done so and the article is available <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/12/11/what-can-article-level-metrics-do-for-you/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course I didn’t want to simply republish the article, but I wanted to publish an improved version. The article has five figures, four of them show visualizations of ALM data that were generated using R (the fifth figure is a table reproduced from another article). The PLOS article includes the ALM dataset and the R scripts used to generate the figures as <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.s001">supplementary information</a>. What I have done now is to recreate the article as a single markdown file (available <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/blog/blob/master/_posts/2013-12-11-what-can-article-level-metrics-do-for-you.Rmd">here</a>) that has all R code embedded. Using R and <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> - and the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/data/alm_report_plos_biology_2013-05-20.csv">CSV file with the ALM data</a> - everyone can now reproduce the figures from the paper by simply running the embedded code, and can dig deeper into the data.</p>
<figure>
<img src="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/2013-12-11_figure_3.svg" class="kg-image" alt="Figure 3. Views vs. citations for PLOS Biology articles published in 2010." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Views vs. citations for PLOS Biology articles published in 2010.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This was a good opportunity to improve the accessibility of the article in other ways. Instead of the raster image formats PNG, JPEG and TIFF used by PLOS and almost every other publisher, I generated the figures in the vector format SVG. Not only does SVG produce images independent of device resolution and screen size (try to zoom in on the figure above), but SVG can also easily be manipulated in the browser since it is XML. This is beyond the scope of this blog post, but look at the <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> Javascript library for great examples of how SVG can be dynamically generated and changed in the browser. <strong><strong>Figure 3</strong></strong> above could for example be enhanced so that the article title is displayed when you hover over one of the bubbles, or we could enable zooming to show more detail.</p>
<p>Like all content on this blog, the article was created using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, and the bibliography was dynamically generated. This makes it easy to change the citation style, and I decided to use the <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA Style</a> that shows the citations in the text as author-date rather than numbered as with the PLOS style (see the example citation in the first paragraph). The combined bibliography for all blog posts including the article can be downloaded in bibtex format <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/bibliography/references.bib">here</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to generate nicer HTML for a better online reading experience. I haven’t done anything fancy, but most publishers seem to focus on navigation around an article, so that very little screen real estate is left for the actual content of the article. I’ve tried to improve readability by reducing the navigation areas to a minimum, by using readable fonts in larger sizes: <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/minion-pro">Adobe Minion Pro</a> for the body text and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/myriad-pro">Adobe Myriad Pro</a> for headings, tables and figure legends.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Article-level metrics (ALMs) provide a wide range of metrics about the uptake of an individual journal article by the scientific community after publication. They include citations, usage statistics, discussions in online comments and social media, social bookmarking, and recommendations. In this essay, we describe why article-level metrics are an important extension of traditional citation-based journal metrics and provide a number of example from ALM data collected for PLOS Biology.</em></p>

<p>The scientific impact of a particular piece of research is reflected in how this work is taken up by the scientific community. The first systematic approach that was used to assess impact, based on the technology available at the time, was to track citations and aggregate them by journal. This strategy is not only no longer necessary â€” since now we can easily track citations for individual articles â€” but also, and more importantly, journal-based metrics are now considered a poor performance measure for individual articles (Campbell, 2008; Glänzel &amp; Wouters, 2013). One major problem with journal-based metrics is the variation in citations per article, which means that a small percentage of articles can skew, and are responsible for, the majority of the journal-based citation impact factor, as shown by Campbell (2008) for the 2004 <em>Nature</em> Journal Impact Factor. <strong><strong>Figure 1</strong></strong> further illustrates this point, showing the wide distribution of citation counts between <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles published in 2010. <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles published in 2010 have been cited a median 19 times to date in Scopus, but 10% of them have been cited 50 or more times, and two articles (Dickson, Wang, Krantz, Hakonarson, &amp; Goldstein, 2010; Narendra et al., 2010) more than 300 times. <em>PLOS Biology</em> metrics are used as examples throughout this essay, and the dataset is available in the supporting information (<strong><strong>Data S1</strong></strong>). Similar data are available for an increasing number of other publications and organizations.</p>

<p>Scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator (Bollen, Sompel, Hagberg, &amp; Chute, 2009; Glänzel &amp; Wouters, 2013; Schekman &amp; Patterson, 2013). To this end, PLOS has collected and displayed a variety of metrics for all its articles since 2009. The array of different categorised article-level metrics (ALMs) used and provided by PLOS as of August 2013 are shown in <strong><strong>Figure 2</strong></strong>. In addition to citations and usage statistics, i.e., how often an article has been viewed and downloaded, PLOS also collects metrics about: how often an article has been saved in online reference managers, such as Mendeley; how often an article has been discussed in its comments section online, and also in science blogs or in social media; and how often an article has been recommended by other scientists. These additional metrics provide valuable information that we would miss if we only consider citations. Two important shortcomings of citation-based metrics are that (1) they take years to accumulate and (2) citation analysis is not always the best indicator of impact in more practical fields, such as clinical medicine (Eck, Waltman, Raan, Klautz, &amp; Peul, 2013). Usage statistics often better reflect the impact of work in more practical fields, and they also sometimes better highlight articles of general interest (for example, the 2006 <em>PLOS Biology</em> article on the citation advantage of Open Access articles (Eysenbach, 2006), one of the 10 most-viewed articles published in <em>PLOS Biology</em>).</p>

<p>A bubble chart showing all 2010 <em>PLOS Biology</em> articles (<strong><strong>Figure 3</strong></strong>) gives a good overview of the year’s views and citations, plus it shows the influence that the article type (as indicated by dot color) has on an article’s performance as measured by these metrics. The weekly <em>PLOS Biology</em> publication schedule is reflected in this figure, with articles published on the same day present in a vertical line. <strong><strong>Figure 3</strong></strong> also shows that the two most highly cited 2010 <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles are also among the most viewed (indicated by the red arrows), but overall there isn’t a strong correlation between citations and views. The most-viewed article published in 2010 in <em>PLOS Biology</em> is an essay on Darwinian selection in robots (Floreano &amp; Keller, 2010). Detailed usage statistics also allow speculatulation about the different ways that readers access and make use of published literature; some articles are browsed or read online due to general interest while others that are downloaded (and perhaps also printed) may reflect the reader’s intention to look at the data and results in detail and to return to the article more than once.</p>

<p>When readers first see an interesting article, their response is often to view or download it. By contrast, a citation may be one of the last outcomes of their interest, occuring only about 1 in 300 times a PLOS paper is viewed online. A lot of things happen in between these potential responses, ranging from discussions in comments, social media, and blogs, to bookmarking, to linking from websites. These activities are usually subsumed under the term â€œaltmetrics,â€? and their variety can be overwhelming. Therefore, it helps to group them together into categories, and several organizations, including PLOS, are using the category labels of Viewed, Cited, Saved, Discussed, and Recommended (<strong><strong>Figures 2 and 4</strong></strong>, see also (Lin &amp; Fenner, 2013)).</p>

<p>All <em>PLOS Biology</em> articles are viewed and downloaded, and almost all of them (all research articles and nearly all front matter) will be cited sooner or later. Almost all of them will also be bookmarked in online reference managers, such as Mendeley, but the percentage of articles that are discussed online is much smaller. Some of these percentages are time dependent; the use of social media discussion platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook for example, has increased in recent years (93% of <em>PLOS Biology</em> research articles published since June 2012 have been discussed on Twitter, and 63% mentioned on Facebook). These are the locations where most of the online discussion around published articles currently seems to take place; the percentage of papers with comments on the PLOS website or that have science blog posts written about them is much smaller. Not all of this online discussion is about research articles, and perhaps, not surprisingly, the most-tweeted PLOS article overall (with more than 1,100 tweets) is a <em>PLOS Biology</em> perspective on the use of social media for scientists (Bik &amp; Goldstein, 2013).</p>
<p>Some metrics are not so much indicators of a broad online discussion, but rather focus on highlighting articles of particular interest. For example, science blogs allow a more detailed discussion of an article as compared to comments or tweets, and journals themselves sometimes choose to highlight a paper on their own blogs, allowing for a more digestible explanation of the science for the non-expert reader (Fausto et al., 2012). Coverage by other bloggers also serves the same purpose; a good example of this is one recent post on the OpenHelix Blog (“Video Tip of the Week: Turkeys and their genomes,” 2012) that contains video footage of the second author of a 2010 <em>PLOS Biology</em> article (Dalloul et al., 2010) discussing the turkey genome.</p>
<p>F1000Prime, a commercial service of recommendations by expert scientists, was added to the PLOS Article-Level Metrics in August 2013. We now highlight on the PLOS website when any articles have received at least one recommendation within F1000Prime. We also monitor when an article has been cited within the widely used modern-day online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A good example of the latter is the Tasmanian devil Wikipedia page (“Tasmanian devil,” 2013) that links to a <em>PLOS Biology</em> research article published in 2010 (Nilsson et al., 2010). While a F1000Prime recommendation is a strong endorsement from peer(s) in the scientific community, being included in a Wikipedia page is akin to making it into a textbook about the subject area and being read by a much wider audience that goes beyond the scientific community.</p>
<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> is the PLOS journal with the highest percentage of articles recommended in F1000Prime and mentioned in Wikipedia, but there is only partial overlap between the two groups of articles because they focus on different audiences (<strong><strong>Figure 5</strong></strong>). These recommendations and mentions in turn show correlations with other metrics, but not simple ones; you can’t assume, for example, that highly cited articles are more likely to be recommended by F1000Prime, so it will be interesting to monitor these trends now that we include this information.</p>

<p>With the increasing availability of ALM data, there comes a growing need to provide tools that will allow the community to interrogate them. A good first step for researchers, research administrators, and others interested in looking at the metrics of a larger set of PLOS articles is the recently launched ALM Reports tool (“ALM Reports,” 2013). There are also a growing number of service providers, including <a href="http://altmetric.com/">Altmetric.com</a> (“<a href="http://altmetric.com/">Altmetric.com</a>,” 2013), ImpactStory (“ImpactStory,” 2013), and Plum Analytics (“Plum Analytics,” 2013) that provide similar services for articles from other publishers.</p>
<p>As article-level metrics become increasingly used by publishers, funders, universities, and researchers, one of the major challenges to overcome is ensuring that standards and best practices are widely adopted and understood. The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) was recently awarded a grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to work on this (“NISO Alternative Assessment Metrics (Altmetrics) Project,” 2013), and PLOS is actively involved in this project. We look forward to further developing our article-level metrics and to having them adopted by other publishers, which hopefully will pave the way to their wide incorporation into research and researcher assessments.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openingscience.org/get-the-book/">Opening Science: The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing</a> is a SpringerOpen book (using a <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/cases_recipes_howtos/creative_commons_licences">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>) that will be published in a few weeks. If you can’t wait for the book to be published and/or you want to make comments or suggestions, go to the dynamic book online version at <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/">http://book.openingscience.org</a>. I am an author or co-author of three chapters (<a href="http://book.openingscience.org/tools/reference_management">Reference Management</a>, <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/vision/altmetrics">Altmetrics and Other Novel Measures for Scientific Impact</a>, <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/cases_recipes_howtos/unique_identifiers_for_researchers">Unique Identifiers for Researchers</a>) and have helped put the dynamic book together. The book is generated from markdown files hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/openingscience/book/">public Github repo</a> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, and we use <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose</a> to enable online editing of the content.</p>
<p>Using markdown, github, jekyll and pandoc is nothing new for blogs, but this is probably one of the first scholarly books using this workflow. The dynamic book is therefore still very much work in progress and feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Another great example using a very similar workflow is the upcoming book <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/">Advanced R Programming</a> by Hadley Wickham, but he is of course using R and <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> to create most of the markdown. In contrast to Hadley we stored the individual chapters as Jekyll posts rather than pages, as this better integrates with other Jekyll functionality, e.g. tags.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Authoring of scholarly articles is a recurring theme in this blog since it started in 2008. Authoring is still in desperate need for improvement, and nobody has convincingly figured out how to solve this problem. Authoring involves several steps, and it helps to think about them separately:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Writing</strong></strong>. Manuscript writing, including formatting, collaborative authoring</li>
<li><strong><strong>Submission</strong></strong>. Formatting a manuscript according to a publisher’s author guidelines, and handing it over to a publishing platform</li>
<li><strong><strong>Revision</strong></strong>. Changes made to a manuscript in the peer review process, or after publication</li>
</ul>
<p>Although authoring typically involves text, similar issues arise for other research outputs, e.g research data. And these considerations are also relevant for other forms of publishing, whether it is self-publication on a blog or website, or publishing of preprints and white papers.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/1278021067_0bf5c8aa82_c.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="800" height="595" alt="Flickr photo by citnaj." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Flickr photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/citnaj/1278021067/">citnaj</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For me the main challenge in authoring is to go from human-readable unstructured content to highly structured machine-readable content. We could make authoring simpler by either forgoing any structure and just publishing in any format we want, or we can force authors to structure their manuscripts according to a very specific set of rules. The former doesn’t seem to be an option, not only do we have a set of community standards that have evolved for a very long time (research articles for example have title, authors, results, references, etc.), but it also makes it hard to find and reuse scholarly research by others.</p>
<p>The latter option is also not really viable since most researchers haven’t learned to produce their research outputs in machine-readable highly standardized formats. There are some exceptions, e.g. <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</a> and other reporting standards in clinical medicine or the <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/23/brian-mcmahon-publishing-semantic-crystallography-every-science-data-publisher-should-watch-this-all-the-way-through/">semantic publishing in Crystallography</a>, but for the most part research outputs are too diverse to easily find a format that works for all of them. The current trend is certainly towards machine-readable rather than towards human-readable, but there is still a significant gap - scholarly articles are transformed from documents in Microsoft Word (or sometimes LaTeX) format into XML (for most biomedical research that means <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">JATS</a>) using kludgy tools and lots of manual labor.</p>
<p>What solutions have been tried to overcome the limitations of our current authoring tools, and to make the process more enjoyable for authors and more productive for publishers?</p>
<ol>
<li>Do the conversion manually, still a common workflow.</li>
<li>Tools for publishers such as <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/05/01/extyles_interview_with_elizabeth_blake_and_bruce_rosenblum/">eXtyles</a>, <a href="http://www.shabash.net/merops/">Merops</a> - both commercial - or the evolving Open Source <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/mpach/modules">mPach</a> that convert Microsoft Word documents into JATS XML and do a lot of automated checks along the way.</li>
<li>Tools for authors that directly generate JATS XML, either as a Microsoft Word plugin (the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview-with-pablo-fernicola">Article Authoring Add-In</a>, not actively maintained) in the browser (e.g. <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/27/lemon8_xml_interview_with_mj_suhonos/">Lemon8-XML</a>, not actively maintained), or directly in a publishing platform such as Wordpress (<a href="http://annotum.org/">Annotum</a>).</li>
<li>Forget about XML and use HTML5 has the canonical file format, e.g. as <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/">Scholarly HTML</a> or HTML5 specifications such as <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/blob/master/specification.asciidoc">HTMLBook</a>. Please read Molly Sharp’s <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/structured-documents-for-science-jats-xml-as-canonical-content-format/">blog post</a> for background information about HTML as an alternative to XML.</li>
<li>Use file formats for authoring that are a better fit for the requirements of scholarly authors, in particular <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">Scholarly Markdown</a>.</li>
<li>Build online editors for scientific content that hide the underlying file format, and guide users towards a structured format, e.g. by not allowing input that doesn’t conform to specifications.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>Solution 1.</strong></strong> isn’t really an option, as it makes scholarly publishing unnecessarily slow and expensive. Typesetter Kaveh Bazergan has gone on record at the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-a-global-conference/">SpotOn London Conference 2012</a> by saying that the current process is insane and that he wants to be “put out of business”.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Solution 2.</strong></strong> is probably the most commonly used workflow used by larger publishers today, but is very much centered around a Microsoft Word to XML workflow. LaTeX is a popular authoring environment in some disciplines, but still requires work to convert documents into web-friendly formats such as HTML and XML.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Solutions 3. to 5.</strong></strong> have never picked up any significant traction. Overall the progress in this area has been modest at best, and the mainstream of authoring today isn’t too different from 20 years ago. Although I have gone on record for saying that <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/tags.html#markdown-ref">Scholarly Markdown</a> has a lot of potential, the problem is much bigger than finding a single file format, and markdown will never be the solution for all authoring needs.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Solution 6.</strong></strong> is an area where a lot of exciting development is currently happening, examples include <a href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</a>, <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/">WriteLateX</a>, <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</a>. Although the future of scholarly authoring will certainly include online authoring tools (making it much easier to collaborate, one of the authoring pain points), we run the risk of locking in users into one particular authoring environment.</p>
<h3 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h3>
<p>How can we move forward? I would suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publishers should accept manuscripts in any reasonable file format, which means at least Microsoft Word, Open Office, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML and PDF, but possibly more. This will create a lot of extra work for publishers, but will open the doors for innovation, both in the academic and commercial sector. We will never see significant progress in scholarly authoring tools if the submission step requires manuscripts to be in a single file format (Microsoft Word) - in particular since this file format is a general purpose word processsing format and not something designed specifically for scholarly content. And we want researchers to spend their time doing research and writing up their research, not formatting documents.</li>
<li>To handle this avalanche of unstructured documents, publishers need conversion tools that can transform all these documents into a format that can feed into their editorial and publishing workflows. A limited number of these tools exist already, but this will require a significant development effort. Again, opening up submissions to a variety of file formats will not only foster innovation in authoring tools, but also in document conversion tools.</li>
<li>We should think beyond XML. Many of the workflows designed today center around conversions from one XML format to another, e.g. Microsoft Word to JATS or <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">TEI</a> (popular in the humanities), often using XLST transforms. Not only is XML difficult for humans to read or edit, but the web and many of the technologies built around it are moving away from XML towards HTML5 and JSON. XML is fine as an important output format for publishing, but maybe not the best format to hold everything together.</li>
<li>As we haven’t come up with a canonical file format for scholarly documents by now, we should give up that idea. XML is great for publisher workflows, but is not something humans can easily edit or read. PDF is still the most widely read format by humans, but is not a good intermediary format. LaTeX is too complex for authors outside of mathematics, physics and related fields, and is not built with web standards in mind. Markdown is promising, but doesn’t easily support highly structured content. And HTML5 and the related ePub are widely popular, but can be hard to edit without a visual editor, and currently don’t include enough standard metadata to support scholarly content out of the box.</li>
<li>The focus should not be on canonical file formats for scholarly documents, but on tools that understand the manuscripts created by researchers and can transform them into something more structured. As we have learned from document conversion tools such as <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, we can’t do this with a simple find and replace using regular expressions, but need a more structured approach. Pandoc is taking the input document (markdown, LaTeX or HTML) apart and is constructing an abstract syntax tree (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>) of the document, using parsing expression grammar (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">PEG</a>), which includes a set of parsing rules. Parsing expression grammars are fairly new, <a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/peg">first described by Bryan Ford</a> about 10 years ago, but in my mind are a very good fit for the formal grammar of scientific documents. It should be fairly straightforward to generate a variety of output formats from the AST (Pandoc can convert into more than 30 document formats), the hard part is the parsing of the input.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this requires a lot of work. Pandoc is a good model to start, but is written in Haskell, a functional programming language that not many people are familar with. For small changes Pandoc allows you to directly manipulate the AST (represented as JSON) using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html">filters</a> written in Haskell or Python. And <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">custom writers</a> for other document formats can be written using <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, another interesting programming language that not many people know about. Lua is a fast and relatively easy to learn scripting language that can be easily embedded into other languages, and for similar reasons is also used to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua">extend the functionality of Wikipedia</a>. PEG parsers in other languages include <a href="http://treetop.rubyforge.org/">Treetop</a> (Ruby), <a href="http://pegjs.majda.cz/">PEG.js</a> (Javascript), and <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>, a popular parser generator that also includes PEG features.</p>
<p>But I think the effort to build a solid open source conversion tool for scholarly documents is worth it, in particular for smaller publishers and publishing platforms who can’t afford the commercial Microsoft Word to JATS conversion tools. We shouldn’t take any shortcuts - e.g. by focussing on XML and XLST transforms - and we can improve this tool over time, e.g. by starting with a few input and output formats. This tool will be valuable beyond authoring, as it can also be very helpful to convert published scholarly content into other formats such as ePub, and in text mining, which in many ways tries to solve many of the same problems. The <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/scripting.html">Pandoc documentation</a> includes an example of extracting all URLs out of a document, and this can be modified to extract other content. In case you wonder whether I gave up on the idea of <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/tags.html#markdown-ref">Scholarly Markdown</a> - not at all. To me this is a logical next step, opening up journal submission systems to Scholarly Markdown and other evolving file formats. And Pandoc, one of the most interesting tools in this space, is a markdown conversion tool at its heart. The next steps could be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>write a custom writer in Lua that generates JATS output from Pandoc</li>
<li>explore how difficult it would be to add Microsoft Word .docx as Pandoc input format</li>
<li>develop Pandoc filters relevant for scholarly documents (e.g. <a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">auto-linking accession numbers of biomedical databases</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following blog post summarizes some of my thoughts before, during and after the conference, and I want to focus on innovation in scholarly publishing, or rather: what is holding us back?</p>
<h2 id="reason-1">Reason #1</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-whats-your-number-altmetrics-session/">#solo13alt</a> session on Saturday looked at <em>the role of altmetrics in the evaluation of scientific research</em>. I was one of the panelists and had summarized my ideas prior to the session in a <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/evaluating-impact-whats-your-number/">blog post</a> written together with Jennifer Lin. It was an interesting session, although a bit too controversial for my taste. But it became obvious to me in this and a few other sessions that other obsession with quantitative assessment of science is increasingly dangerous. Other people have said this more eloquently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mania for measurement - Stephen Curry in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-whats-your-number-altmetrics-session/">#solo13alt</a> session</li>
<li>Why research assessment is out of control - <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/04/peter-scott-research-excellence-framework">Peter Scott</a></li>
<li>Universities are becoming metrics factories, driven by large corporates - <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2013/11/10/spoton2013-yet-another-wonderful-meeting/">Peter Murray-Rust</a></li>
<li>The ‘real’ revolution in science will come when the scientific egosystem gets rid of the credit-imperative - <a href="https://twitter.com/Villavelius/status/399157271793762304">Jan Velterop</a></li>
<li>Excellence by Nonsense: The Competition for Publications in Modern Science - <a href="http://book.openingscience.org/basics_background/excellence_by_nonsense/">Mathias Binswanger</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My job title is <em>Technical Lead Article-Level Metrics</em> so it might sound surprising that I say this. But we have to differentiate of what we do now and in the next few years - which is mainly to get away from the Journal Impact Factor to more reasonable metrics that look at individual articles and include other metrics besides citations - to where we want to be in 10 or more years. And for the latter it is essential that journal articles and other research outputs are valued for the research they contain, rather than serving as a currency for <em>merit</em> that can be exchanged into grants and acadmic advancement. This is a very difficult problem to solve and I have no answers yet. Going back to how science was conducted until about 50 years ago - as a small elite club that worked based on closed personal networks - is definitely not the answer.</p>
<h2 id="reason-2">Reason #2</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-keynote-1-boson-50-years-50003-scientists-understanding-our-universe-through-global-scientific-collaboration-and-open-access/">his keynote</a> Salvatore Mele from CERN explained to us that Open Access in High Energy Phsics is 50 years old, and that the culture of sharing preprints preceeded the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> e-prints service - scientists were mailing their manuscripts to each other at least 20 years before ArXiV launched in 1991. A similar culture doesn’t exist in the life sciences and therefore the preprint services for biologists launched this year (e.g. <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/">PeerJ Preprints</a> and <a href="http://biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a>) will have a hard time gaining traction.</p>
<p>Email is one of those services that every researcher uses, and we should think much more about how we can create innovative services around email rather than only considering new tools and services that are still used only by early adopters. AJ Cann had coordinated a workshop around email at SpotOn London that he called <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-the-dark-art-of-dark-social-email-the-antisocial-medium-which-will-not-die-workshop/">the dark art of dark social: email, the antisocial medium that will not die</a>. I am still puzzled why most researchers prefer to receive tables of content by email rather than as a RSS feed, but we shouldn’t confuse what we get excited about as software developers and early adopters of online tools with what the mainstream scientist would be likely to use.</p>
<p>Another good example is <a href="http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/">data sharing</a>, a topic that was discussed in at least three SpotOn sessions. Even though most attendees at SpotOn London agreed that sharing of research data is important, it is obvious that this is currently not common practice in most scientific disciplines. Funders have created data sharing policies (e.g. <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">NSF</a> or the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Data-sharing/">Wellcome Trust</a>), as <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067111">have publishers</a>, and many organizations are thinking about incentives for data sharing, including data journals such as <a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/">Scientific Data</a> that will launch in 2014 and was presented by Ruth Wilson in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-can-we-encourage-data-sharing-discussion/">motivations for data sharing</a> session. Even though incentives can help promote changes, I am pessimistic that something as central to the conduct of science as data sharing can be changed without more scientists being intrinsically motivated to do so. This is a much slower process that should start as early as possible during training, as pointed out by Kaitlin Thaney in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-can-we-encourage-data-sharing-discussion/">#solo13carrot</a> session.</p>
<h2 id="reason-3">Reason #3</h2>
<p>In terms of the technology that is holding us back, I increasingly think that publisher manuscript submission systems may be the single most important place that is slowing down innovation. I participated in the first <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop in 2011, and I think now that <strong><strong>Beyond the MTS (or manuscript tracking system)</strong></strong> might have been a better motto than <strong><strong>Beyond the PDF</strong></strong>, as many of the problems we discussed relate to typical editorial workflows we use today. These systems need to implement many of the ideas discussed at SpotOn London and other places, from opening up peer review (<a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-should-peer-review-evolve/">#solo13peer</a>) to making it easier to integrate research data into manuscripts (<a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-how-should-peer-review-evolve/">#solo13carrot</a>) and to ideas of how the scientific record should like in the digital age (<a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-what-should-the-scientific-record-look-like-in-the-digital-age-discussion/">#solo13digital</a>). In the latter panel we discussed both new authoring tools such as <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/">WriteLaTeX</a>, and new ideas of what a research object should look like and how the different parts are linked to each other. A major theme here was reproducibility highlighted both by Carol Goble (also see her <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/carolegoble/ismb2013-keynotecleangoble">ISMB/ECCB 2013 Keynote</a>) and Peter Kraker (see also his <a href="http://science.okfn.org/2013/10/18/its-not-only-peer-reviewed-its-reproducible/">Open Knowledge Foundation blog post</a>).</p>
<p>The problem with today’s manuscript submission systems is that they have grown so big and complex that any change is slow and cumbersome, rather than iterative and part of an ongoing dialogue. I don’t want to blame any single vendor of these systems, but rather suggest that we carefully re-evaluate the workflow from the manuscript written by one or more authors to the accepted manuscript. My personal interest is mainly in authoring tools, and I have recently written about and experimented with <a href="http://localhost:4000/tags.html#markdown-ref">Markdown</a>. This process of re-evaluating manuscript tracking systems is not simply about technology, but is rather about how we approach this problem as author, publisher, tool vendor and as a community.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Friday and Saturday the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london2013/">SpotOn London Conference</a> will take place at the British Library in London. I am very excited, as I have come to this conference since the <a href="https://twitter.com/McDawg/status/397068628102610945">first one in 2008</a>, and have helped organize the event since 2009. The conference is about science communication in the broadest sense, and has three strands that focus on <em>science communication, science policy and tools</em>. Equally important as the sessions are of course the many highly engaging informal discussions of the 250 participants that take place between and after the sessions.</p>

<p>SpotOn London sessions are also more conversations than presentations, as they usually have 2-4 panelists with ample time for discussion with the audience. I will take part in two panels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-what-the-hack-part-one-hackdays-session/">What the hack?!</a> (Friday 10:30 AM, hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23solo13hack">#solo13hack</a>), with Peter Murray-Rust, Ross Mounce and Helen Jackson</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-whats-your-number-altmetrics-session/">What’s your number? - Altmetrics session</a> (Saturday 10:30 AM, hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23solo13alt">#solo13alt</a>), with Marie Boran, David Colquhoun, Jean Liu and Stephen Curry</li>
</ul>
<p>I will summarize my thoughts regarding the altmetrics session in another post, but want to talk about the first session in more detail. According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">English Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
A <strong><strong>hackathon</strong></strong> (also known as a <strong><strong>hack day</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>hackfest</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>codefest</strong></strong>) is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects.

<p>It is too bad that we will have no hackathon at year’s SpotOn London for logistical reasons, but the session is a great opportunity to reflect on the value of science hackdays. It is clear that hackdays for scientific software have become popular, with almost too many opportunities to participate.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-don-t-like">What I don’t like</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hackdays are very much targeted at intermediate to advanced software developers, and it is sometimes not easy for beginners to participate</li>
<li>Too much time spent setting up stuff</li>
<li>Some of the work done at hackdays can be better done in virtual collaborations over weeks or months</li>
<li>Not many projects make it beyond the hackday and actually turn into a useable product. One example where this is not true are the visualizations started at the ALM 2012 hackathon that were implemented by OJS in 2013 (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v6i0.19283">see article for more</a>), and of course <a href="http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> that started at a hackathon at the <a href="http://beyond-impact.org/">Beyond Impact</a> conference in May 2011.</li>

<li>Go beyond software development. We <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/alm-data-challenge-metrics-for-a-standard-set-of-dois/">recently tried a data challenge using Altmetrics data</a>, and at a <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/02/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">hackathon between IGSN, DataCite, PANGAEA and ORCID in July</a> we focussed on a high-level discussion of technical issues. There is a continuum towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> format, although I don’t like to drift too much from <em>doing</em> to <em>talking</em>. A good example of a workshop open to everyone and not just software developers is the SpotOn London workshop this Saturday on <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-wikipedia-editing-workshop/">Wikipedia Editing</a> run by Brian Kelly and Toni Sant.</li>
<li>Meet before and after the hackathon. This can be done online, but it helps to focus on what can be achieved in the limited time available for a hackathon, and to follow up on projects that have just been started. But a hackathon is also a great opportunity to meet new people and new ideas, so meeting afterwards is more important than before.</li>
<li>Involve remote people. A lot of the fun of hackdays comes from sitting around a table and doing something together. But sometimes this is not possible for everyone, so think about remote participation where it makes sense.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think it is fair to say that commenting on scientific papers is broken. And with commenting I mean online comments that are publicly available, not informal discussions in journal clubs or at meetings. This definition would include discussions of papers on social media such as Twitter or Facebook. Why do I think that commenting is broken?</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of papers with online comments is low. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">For PLOS Biology</a> we have comments on the journal platform for 11% of articles, tweets for 14% of articles and Facebook activity for 22% of articles. The numbers for Twitter and Facebook are much higher for more recently published articles, but are nowhere close to every article having at least one comment.</li>
<li>even though there is a fair amount of social media activity around articles, the quality of the discussion is varied. Twitter for example seems to work mostly as an alerting service for interesting articles with little more than the title of the article in the tweet text and not much discussion.</li>
<li>when comments are made, they are really hard to find coming from the article. Unless they are made on the journal platform, or the publisher tracks article-level metrics and links out to these comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>What can be done to address these issues, i.e. increase the number of comments, increase the depth of the discussion, and make it easier to link comments to articles? Some of the thoughts that I and others have had include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower the technical barriers for commenting by providing a common and familiar commenting platform with an attractive user interface. Many blogs (including this one) and <a href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/">some publishers</a> use Disqus, which is arguably the most popular third-party commenting platform.</li>
<li>develop new features that make commenting more attractive, including comments linked to specific sections of the text and notes that can be public, semi-public or private. See for example <a href="https://medium.com/about/5972c72b18f2">what Medium is doing</a>, check out <a href="http://hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a> and <a href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/62886292466/peerj-questions-a-new-way-to-never-publish-forget">PeerJ Questions</a>, or study what services such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> are doing.</li>
<li>Link comments made in different places about the same object together, e.g. through Article-Level Metrics services.</li>
<li>create incentives for scientists to comment, e.g. through <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Mozilla Open Badges</a> or by making them part of a community.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Tuesday the US National Library of Medicine launched <a href="http://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2013/10/22/pubmed-commons-a-new-forum-for-scientific-discourse/">PubMed Commons</a> as a <em>New Forum for Scientific Discourse</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
We hope that PubMed Commons will leverage the social power of the internet to encourage constructive criticism and high quality discussions of scientific issues that will both enhance understanding and provide new avenues of collaboration within the community.
</blockquote>
<p>PubMed Commons is still a pilot project and in order to read or write comments you have to be a PubMed Commons participant and be signed in with your My NCBI account. PubMed Commons has some important features:</p>
<ul>
<li>PubMed is probably the place where most life sciences researchers search for literature. Having comments and discussion there makes perfect sense, and is probably a better place than a publisher platform that only targets particular journals. PubMed also has a reputation that is very different from social media tools that are popular, but not really familiar to most scientists.</li>
<li>Access to PubMed Commons is restricted to researchers, and this is one strategy to have the comments focus on scientific discourse. It has to be seen whether the process of registering for PubMed Commons (which currently is a bit more involved than most commenting systems) is a barrier for scientists to take part in the discussion, or whether it generates an audience that makes it more likely that scientists contribute.</li>
<li>For people signing in with their My NCBI account (I don’t know the percentage of PubMed users that do that on a regular basis), commenting is really easy and the interface is straightforward. The comment editor uses markdown, which makes it easy to format comments and to include links.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday PLOS Biology published an essay by me: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">What Can Article Level Metrics Do for You?</a> (Fenner, 2013). I had help from many others in writing the essay, in particular PLOS Biology editor Emma Ganley. I hope that the essay can help researchers get introduced to article-level metrics, and I am honored that the essay is part of the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001688">PLOS Biology 10th anniversary collection</a>.</p>
<p>The essay is an Open Access article published under a CC-BY license, so not only can everyone read it, but the text and figures can be freely reused, as long as proper attribution is provided, e.g. Fig. 5:</p>

</figure>
<p>Although this is an essay and not a research article, I’ve added the data and R scripts used to generate the figures (1, 3-5) as <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.s001">supporting information</a>. As I <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/10/20/the-complete-article/">have said earlier</a>, I think it is important that an article contains more than the text. With the open source software <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> or <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> everyone can recreate the figures, and can look at the data underlying the figures in the essay. One can for example look into the data behind Fig. 5 to better understand how articles with F1000Prime recommendations <strong><strong>and</strong></strong> Wikipedia mentions differ from those <strong><strong>only</strong></strong> recommended in F1000Prime. Feel free to ask for help getting started in the comments.</p>
<p>Incidentally this is also my first PLOS article (my wife is way ahead of me with 5 research articles), so that I can finally look at PLOS article-level metrics as an author - after being the technical lead for this project since May 2012.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open access to research data is becoming increasingly important, as manifested by memos or press releases from the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTX035043.htm">Wellcome Trust</a>, the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-790_en.htm">European Commission</a>, and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research">the Office of Science and Technology Policy</a> (OSTP) from the White House.</p>
<p>Open access to research data is important as this makes it easier for other researchers to reproduce the research, and to build upon the research by others by re-analysis of data or combination with other research data. In other words, <a href="http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/">Science as an open enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>The major challenge to open access to research data is that data sharing is not a widespread practice. Several strategies have been developed to create incentives for researchers to share research data, including services that make it easier to share research data (e.g. <a href="http://figshare.com/">figshare</a>, <a href="http://dataup.cdlib.org/">DataUp</a> and <a href="http://www.zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>), <a href="http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=586">metrics for research data</a>, and data journals such as <a href="http://www.earth-system-science-data.net/">Earth System Science Data</a>, <a href="http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/">GigaScience</a> or the <a href="http://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/">Journal of open archaeology data</a>. Some of the sticks that have been tried in addition to the carrots above include data management plan requirements such as those <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">set forth by the National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> in 2011.</p>
<p>I would argue that all these carrots and sticks will eventually fall short, unless we redefine what the journal article (and similarly monograph) in the digital age should be about. Research data should become a required part of any research article, rather than an optional afterthought, or taking on a life on their own in a separate data journal.</p>
<p>The <em>complete article</em> - as I would like to call this journal article made fit for the digital age - should not only include the research data used to create figures and tables and reportes as results. Equally important are descriptions of reagents, workflows and software tools that go into much more detail compared to what is common practice today.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/complete_paper.png" class="kg-image" width="567" height="495" alt="Ingredients of the complete article" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><strong>Ingredients of the complete article</strong></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <em>complete article</em> does not have to come as one big file. More likely the research data will be hosted at one or more data centers elsewhere. Authorship will turn into contributorship and will include all roles required to put the <em>complete article</em> together, including for example data collection and -analysis, and writing software needed to analyze the data. The <em>complete article</em> can be shorter or longer than the typical article today, important is not article length, but the combination of text, data, and description of reagents and analysis tools.</p>
<p>The <em>complete article</em> should also include (or link to) the text of the peer reviews and previous article versions, including preprints. This makes it much easier to understand the article (and the data) in context. The <em>complete article</em> should also link to article-level metrics post-publication for similar reasons.</p>
<p>This idea of a <em>complete article</em> is not too far away from the best practices used today, but it is important to make it the default for scientific publication. Too much of what we publish today is still centered around the concept of what can be printed on paper, and telling exciting stories that have impact counts more than telling complete stories that can be reproduced.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we created a set of roughly 10,000 DOIs for journal articles published in 2011 or 2012. We used these DOIs as a reference set in a <a href="http://almdatachallenge.eventbrite.com/">data hackathon</a> around article-level metrics/altmetrics - material for another blog post.</p>
<p>The random DOis were generated using the <a href="http://random.labs.crossref.org/">CrossRef RanDOIm service</a>, with article titles fetched from the <a href="http://labs.crossref.org/openurl/">CrossRef OpenURL API</a>. We didn’t have time to properly parse the publication date and only used the publication year. We used the <code>crossref_r</code> and <code>crossref</code> functions from the rOpenSci <a href="http://ropensci.github.io/rplos/">rplos package</a> (and some extra help from Scott Chamberlain) to achieve this, the datasets were deposited to figshare and can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.821209">here</a> (2011) and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.821213">here</a> (2012).</p>
<p>The basic idea behind DOI names is summarized well in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">Wikipedia entry</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
A digital object identifier (DOI) is a character string (a “digital identifier”) used to uniquely identify an object such as an electronic document. Metadata about the object is stored in association with the DOI name and this metadata may include a location, such as a URL, where the object can be found. The DOI for a document is permanent, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI provides more stable linking than simply referring to it by its URL, because if its URL changes, the publisher need only update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.
</blockquote>
<p>DOIs for journal articles should provide users with a URL specific for that journal article. This URL could point to a digital copy of the journal article in HTML or PDF format, or could point to a landing page (with an abstract or other basic metadata) for journal articles that require a subscription. This should work not only for humans using a web browser, but also for automated services using command line tools such as <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> as scientific infrastructure depends heavily on automation and computers talking to each other. In our use case we want to find content linking to a specific article, and as some services (e.g. social media) will use the URL and not DOI of an article, we need to find out that URL.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it was difficult to find a URL for many DOIs in our reference set using automated tools. All these DOIs resolve to URLs for human users using a web browser, but for automated tools there are a number of challenges:</p>
<h3 id="requiring-a-cookie">Requiring a cookie</h3>
<p>Some publishers require a cookie, and that can cause problems for automated tools. We can use the popular command line tool <code>curl</code> with the options <code>-L</code> to follow redirects and <code>-I</code> to only send the header (as we care about the location and not the content of the page).</p>
<pre><code>curl -I -L &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2010.531020&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This command will lead us not to a page specific for that article, but to a “Cookie absent” page. You can work around this by having curl accept cookies:</p>
<pre><code>curl -I -L --cookie &quot;tmp&quot; &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2010.531020&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately not all tools do this. The way Facebook tracks likes, shares, comments, etc. is a prominent example.</p>
<h3 id="too-many-redirects">Too many redirects</h3>
<p>Some DOIs never resolve using a HEAD request, and curl stops after 50 redirects:</p>
<pre><code>curl -I -L &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0b013e318235e525&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This error may relate to the “requiring a cookie” error above.</p>
<h3 id="method-not-allowed">Method not allowed</h3>
<p>Some DOis HEAD requests result in a “405 Method Not Allowed” error. The reason is that the journal platform doesn’t accept the HEAD request, but wants a GET instead.</p>
<pre><code>curl -I -L &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sam.10120&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">HTTP 1.1 protocol</a> says about HEAD:</p>
<blockquote>
The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. … This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
</blockquote>
<p>We can work around this error by using a GET request, which unfortunately creates extra overhead and is not the recommended way to obtain this kind of information.</p>
<h3 id="empty-reply-from-server">Empty reply from server</h3>
<p>Some DOIs never resolve using a HEAD because curl reports “Empty reply from server” and we don’t get a HTTP 200 status code.</p>
<pre><code>curl -I -L &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.012&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can again work around this by using the location information before the last redirect, but maybe resolving a DOI should not result in curl routinely throwing an error. It looks as if this error is related to “method not allowed”, as a GET request resolves to a landing page.</p>
<p>This problem is not specific to the <code>curl</code> tool, we get exactly the same error with <code>wget</code>:</p>
<pre><code>wget -S --spider &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.012&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="timeout-errors">Timeout errors</h3>
<p>Some DOI resolutions resulted in timeout errors, but this was temporary and much less frequent than the errors above.</p>
<h3 id="resource-not-found">Resource not found</h3>
<p>We didn’t specifically look into this error, which is a well-known problem with URLs. The DOI names we used were from 2011 and 2012, and it is known that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> is more common the older the resource is.</p>
<h3 id="content-negotiation">Content negotiation</h3>
<p>As Karl Ward has pointed out in the comments there are other ways to get to the URL from the DOI name, e.g. using content negotiation:</p>
<pre><code>curl -LH &quot;Accept: application/vnd.crossref.unixref+xml&quot; &quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.012&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The URL is stored in the <code>doi_data/resource</code> attribute. The URL stored there is unfortunately not always the final landing page for the article, e.g. for the DOI name used in the example above.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>We created a reference set of 10,000 DOIs to collect metrics around them. The first conclusion from this exercise is that getting the URL for these articles is a challenge in many cases. This does not seem to relate to a permission problem for subscription content, but rather how the HTTP HEAD request is handled. Content negotiation is one alternative, but sometimes leads to different URLs for the landing page than where the user would get via the browser. We therefore have to rewrite our code to use GET requests and to better handle the scenarios above.</p>
<p><em>Update 10/13/13: Updated the title and the text to make it clear that I am not talking about DOIs that don’t resolve for human users, but rather about the problems automating this process using command-line tools.</em></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ten days ago Information Standards Quarterly (ISQ) published a <a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/">special issue on altmetrics</a>. I was the guest editor for the five altmetrics articles, and in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.01">editorial</a> that I titled <strong><strong>Altmetrics have come of age</strong></strong> I argued that</p>
<blockquote>
We no longer need to talk about whether it is possible to reliably collect altmetrics, or whether this is valuable information that can complement citations and usage statistics.
</blockquote>
<p>In June we have seen that the National Information Standards Organization (<a href="http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</a>) was <a href="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.07">awarded a grant</a> by the <a href="http://www.sloan.org/">Sloan Foundation</a> to develop standards and recommended best practices for altmetrics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Wikipedia - which is of course an important source of altmetrics information and was also mentioned in the editorial - doesn’t think so. When you try to go to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Altmetrics&amp;redirect=no">Altmetrics</a> page on the English Wikipedia, you get this:</p>

</figure>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">description</a> on the Citation Style Language (CSL) website, CSL <em>is an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies</em>. We use reference managers such as <strong>Zotero</strong>, <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong>, or <strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong> to format our references in manuscripts we submit for publication, and underneath a CSL processor such as <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home">Citeproc-js</a> - together with a CSL file for a particular citation style - is doing the work:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://editor.front-matter.io/content/images/2021/02/csl.png" class="kg-image" width="394" height="577" alt="Citation processing during manuscript writing" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Citation processing during manuscript writing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the journal article is accepted the publisher takes the text with the formatted text citation and turns it into XML, a process that is error-prone and takes time:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It is not hard to see that something is very wrong here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authors are required to use a specific citation style (there are probably about 1,000 different citation styles and many more dependent styles) even though the publisher doesn’t directly use the formatted text. The publisher eLife <a href="http://www.elifesciences.org/elife-references/">accepts references in any format</a>.</li>
<li>Turning structured information into plain text and back into structured XML is always a bad idea. <a href="http://twitter.com/kaveh1000">Kaveh Bazargan</a> is a typesetter who has gone on record for saying that we should stop this nonsense and put him out of business.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also obvious how the ideal workflow should look like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://editor.front-matter.io/content/images/2021/02/csl3.png" class="kg-image" width="768" height="908" alt="Ideal workflow of citation processing" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Ideal workflow of citation processing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We go from structured content to structured content, and never use citations formatted as text as intermediary steps in the workflow.</p>
<p>What is surprising is that this is an ideal workflow and not something that publishers actually do. Most journal author instructions don’t even mention CSL styles (I work for PLOS and they are no exception). There are some issues to be solved, but they are all minor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Citeproc JSON citation format isn’t really an official standard, but rather something invented for the most popular CSL processor, Citeproc-js.</li>
<li>People like to fight over standards, and there are always people you prefer bibtex, RIS, MODS or BibJSON over Citeproc JSON, or want authors to to use JATS XML.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would really like to push Citeproc JSON as a standard bibliographic exchange format for authors. There are several things I like about Citeproc JSON:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the native format to format citations, so it is used internally by many reference managers anyway.</li>
<li>Citeproc JSON is really good in handling all the possible variations of author names. Putting all authors into a single text field as in bibtex requires a lot of trickery to get it right.</li>
<li>JSON is a standard serialization format and there are a kinds of libraries in different programming languages to do things like searching, sorting or finding of duplicates. And JSON is easily extensible, e.g. if we would want to add ORCID identifiers for authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have five suggestions to move forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a specification for Citeproc JSON that is as clear as the CSL specification.</li>
<li>Consider extending the specification to include content other than citations. Ideally we should be able to add arbitrary <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/29/metadata-in-scholarly-markdown/">metadata about a manuscript</a>.</li>
<li>Consider other serialization formats besides JSON. I particularly <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/30/citeproc-yaml-for-bibliographies/">like YAML</a> as it is very similar to JSON, but human-readable, but other people might prefer XML. It is relatively easy to transform data between these serialization formats, in particular between JSON and YAML. In my <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About page</a> I only need the <a href="https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml">js-yaml</a> library and one extra line of code to use Citeproc YAML instead of Citeproc JSON (in the d3.js visualization).</li>
<li>Add Citeproc JSON (and YAML) support to reference managers. Zotero is already doing this, but it should be an easy to add feature if the reference manager is already using CSL internally (Mendeley and Papers).</li>
<li>Push publishers to accept Citeproc JSON with manuscript submissions.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that I can <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/08/04/automatically-list-all-your-publications-in-your-blog/">automatically import my publications from my ORCID profile and display them</a> in this blog, I also want to visualize them. I have started with <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/blog/blob/master/_includes/by_year.js">d3.js code</a> that displays the number of publications per year - using the list of my publications in Citeproc JSON format. The chart is displayed on my <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About page</a>, but I have also embedded the Javascript here:</p>
<p>I am a big fan of data visualizations because they can highlight something that you would otherwise miss. In this case I was really surprised to see how well my different academic jobs over the years (1991-1993, 1994-1998, 1998-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2012) are reflected in my publication pattern. You clearly see the gaps between the jobs, indicating that I not only switched jobs, but also changed the research focus every time. The publications are listed chronologically on the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About page</a> page and you can look at the papers I wrote since my first publication in 1993. My publication pattern seems to indicate that I was never really on track for a typical academic career, so it should not be a surprise that I left academia in 2012.</p>
<p>There are at least two other visualizations I want to do: publications by type (journal article, book chapter, dataset, etc.), and author position with number of co-authors. You can reuse the Javascript code with small modifications (CSS and the JSON query) even if you are not running a Jekyll blog.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A common feature of blogs written by scientists is a listing of all their publications. Publication lists are a great way to provide background information about your research. Publication lists should provide links to the fulltext versions of these publications, should be nicely formatted - e.g. using a common citation style such as APA - and should be easy to maintain. A number of tools for a variety of blogging platforms (including Wordpress and Jekyll) are available to help with this task, but maintaining the list of publications has remained difficult.</p>
<p>Publication lists are best maintained in a system built for this purpose. This could be either a reference manager, or a profile page in a social network for scientists. Even better suited for this task is your Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) profile, as this service (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>) directly integrates with a number of bibliographic databases and makes the profile information available via an open API.</p>
<h3 id="orcid-feed">ORCID Feed</h3>
<p>Last week I have started work on <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/">ORCID Feed</a>, a service that reformats the API response from ORCID into RSS, bibtex and formattted citations, making it easier for scientists to reuse the content stored in their ORCID profile. This service is still experimental, so please report any issues <a href="https://github.com/orcid-eu-labs/orcid-feed/issues">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jekyll-orcid">jekyll-orcid</h3>
<p>I have now added the final piece to automatically import my publications into this blog. <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-orcid">jekyll-orcid</a> is a Jekyll plugin that automatically downloads all my publications from my ORCID profile via <strong><strong>ORCID Feed</strong></strong> and stores them in a subfolder of this blog, both in bibtex and Citeproc JSON format. It does this every time you regenerate your blog, so that the publication list will be automatically updated with new content. I can then use <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar">jekyll-scholar</a>, a popular Jekyll plugin written by Sylvester Keil to generate a bibliography (<code>jekyll-orcid</code> automatically adds a YAML frontmatter section to the files so that jekyll-scholar can process it). I can format this auto-generated bibliography in a variety of ways - you can see the result in my <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About</a> page where I also provide a download link of the bibtex file.</p>
<p>My publications are of course also available if I want to cite them in the text, e.g. our recent publication summarizing the main findings from the 2011 European Consensus Conference on germ-cell cancer (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>), or last year’s case report on liver toxicity induced by the cancer drug imatinib (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>).</p>
<p>Similar tools also exist for Wordpress, e.g. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/papercite/">Papercite</a>, which can import the bibtex file directly from ORCID Feed.</p>
<h3 id="next">Next</h3>
<p>Now there is only one step missing to have your paper that was just published automatically appear in your publication list. Assuming you have provided your ORCID identifier when you submitted the paper, and the publisher has included your ORCID identifier in the metadata sent to CrossRef (both are already common practices), we only need CrossRef to automatically push that paper into your ORCID profile.</p>
<p>And once we have this workflow in place, we can automatically add additional information, including links to the fulltext paper in the institutional repository, copyright information, and metrics.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The standard local file formats for bibliographic data are probably bibtex and RIS. They have been around for a long time, and are supported by all reference managers and many other tools and services. Unfortunately these formats are far from perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li>neither bibtex nor RIS use a web-friendly data interchange format such as XML or JSON, which makes it harder to work with these formats</li>
<li>bibtex - and to a lesser extend RIS - don’t support all entry types that we need, e.g. datasets, or new standards such as ORCID author identifiers</li>
<li>bibtex stores all authors in a single field, which makes author names hard to parse</li>
</ul>

<p>One obvious solution would be to store bibliographic data in XML or JSON. These formats have very good support in all programming languages, and they are the formats used by APIs on the web. There have been some efforts to standardize these formats for bibliographic data, e.g. <a href="http://www.bibjson.org/">BibJSON</a>, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a>, <a href="http://bibtexml.sourceforge.net/">BibTeX XML</a> or Endnote XML.</p>

    &lt;bibtex:pages&gt;261-263&lt;/bibtex:pages&gt;
  &lt;/bibtex:article&gt;
&lt;/bibtex:entry&gt;</code></pre>
<p>My problem with these formats is that they are made for computers talking to each other and not humans. I personally think that a file with bibliographic data should be human-readable, similar to why <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2012/12/13/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">I like markdown</a> for writing scientific documents.</p>
<p>When you have too many standards and are not happy with any of them, you of course create a new standard.</p>

Taken from <a href="http://xkcd.com/927/" class="uri">http://xkcd.com/927/</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My suggestion for a new bibliographic file format is twofold: a) use YAML for data serialization and b) use CSL as data format. <a href="http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML</a> is a data format popular with Ruby Developers and is described on the <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML website</a> as</p>
<blockquote>
YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.
</blockquote>
<p>Something that not may people seem to know is that YAML is a superset of JSON and that <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759572">every JSON file is also a valid YAML file</a>. The main difference is the better human readability of YAML.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Citation Style Language</strong></strong> is described on the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">CSL website</a> as</p>
<blockquote>
CSL is an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies.
</blockquote>
<p>Although some commercial applications still use proprietary citation styles, CSL has become the de facto standard, and is used by the reference managers <strong><strong>Zotero</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong>, and others. This blog uses CSL via Pandoc and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/citeproc-hs/">citeproc-hs</a> library. CSL processors need bibliographic data in a standard format. The popular <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home">Citeproc-js</a> Javascript CSL processor by Frank Bennett for example uses JSON, but we might as well use YAML:</p>

<p>I hope you agree that this format is not only structured and can be understood by computers, but is also very readable by humans. You may have noticed that I have inserted my ORCID, something that is very difficult to do with bibtex where all authors are stored in one text string (see above).</p>
<p>Careful readers of this blog will of course remember that <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/29/metadata-in-scholarly-markdown/">I have written about</a> using YAML to store metadata about a blog post. We could now add bibliographic information to these metadata, either in the YAML frontmatter (if it is a Jekyll blog), or in a separate file. It should be straightforward to adapt the existing CSL processors to understand YAML since YAML and JSON are so similar. To get started with some Citeproc YAML, use the new (and still experimental) <strong><strong>ORCID Feed</strong></strong> Webservice with your ORCID and specify the <code>yml</code> format, e.g. <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.yml">http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.yml</a> for my publications.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mfenner/orcid-connecting-research-and-researchers-1">ORCID</a>) provides a persistent identifier for researchers and lets them claim their research outputs in the ORCID Registry. I have been involved with ORCID since early 2010 and I am happy to see that nine months after launch 200,000 researchers have signed up for the service, and the organization has more than <a href="http://orcid.org/about/community/members">70 member organizations</a>.</p>
<div class="iframe">

</div>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/register">Registering for an ORCID identifier</a> is easy, and can be done in a few minutes. Claiming works in the profile is also straightforward, and works by integration with CrossRef Search, Scopus, Web of Science, DataCite Metadata Search, and other services. Even though about 1.5 million works have been claimed by now, many users have still not claimed any works or added profile information in other ways.</p>
<p>These numbers should go up as more academic institutions sign up for ORCID and help their researchers create ORCIDs and claim works. In the meantime we need more incentives for researchers to add publications to their ORCID profile. Publication lists are a very good reason to add your papers and other research outputs to your ORCID profile.</p>
<h3 id="publication-lists">Publication Lists</h3>
<p>Every researcher maintains a list of his publications in some form. These publication lists are used for grant and job applications, for academic websites to attract collaborators and students, and more. Publication lists can be generated in many different ways, but I have never heard that someone finds this process fun or easy. The challenge is multiplied when the publication list is not generated for an individual, but for a research group, department or institution (my university goes through this process every year uisng RefWorks and produces an <a href="http://www.refworks.com/RefShare2?site=047931198213200000/RWWS6A619751/2013%20Hochschulbibliografie">annual institutional bibliography</a>).</p>
<p>Although the library usually takes care of the larger publication lists and can help researchers setting up their own lists, there still is much that needs to be done by individual researchers, and the process needs to be easier. Some recommendations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t reinvent the wheel</li>
<li>use persistent identifiers</li>
<li>use standards</li>
<li>don’t worry about citation styles</li>
<li>keep everything upstream, not locally</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t try to invent a new way of managing publication lists. Other people have worked on this problem before, and there are many tools available. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try something new, but please build it on top of all the infrastructure and services we have already.</p>
<p>Managing publication lists becomes much easier when you use persistent identifiers such as DOIs. They make it much easier to obtain metadata (e.g. authors, title, journal) and the full-text version. Some disciplines use other identifiers, but a local identifier such as a URL is usually a bad idea.</p>
<p>Use standard protocols, standard file formats and standard metadata. BibTex and RIS are file formats for references that almost every piece of software handling references understands.</p>
<p>Citation styles come from a time when publications were printed on paper. They make no real sense anymore, and as a researcher you shouldn’t bother which one of 3000+ styles is the appropriate one.</p>
<p>The last recommendation is the most important one. Don’t try to manage publication lists in your local system, or your department, but rather do this as much upstream as possible. ORCID is an ideal service for this. But don’t try to manually add or edit publications in the ORCID registry, but rather claim them from CrossRef, DataCite or similar services, because these are the places that have authoritative information about publication. If you try to “fix” information (because all metadata can contain mistakes), nobody will notice. If something is wrong with your works, notify the publisher so that the CrossRef metadata can be updated.</p>
<h3 id="orcid-profiles-as-rss-feeds">ORCID Profiles as RSS Feeds</h3>
<p>ORCID is a good place to manage publication lists, but it is often not easy to get the information out of the system. The standard way is via a REST API (XML or JSON). This might work really well for a software developer who wants to connect his system to ORCID, but most researchers have other things to do.</p>
<p>RSS was invented to publish information about frequently updated works, and a good example are Tables of Content (TOC) for journals. RSS is also a great tool to manage publication lists, as it can be easily integrated into content management systems such as Wordpress or Drupal. There is a <a href="http://oxford.crossref.org/best_practice/rss/">Recommendation on RSS Feeds for Scholarly Publishers</a>, and we can apply the same guidelines to <strong><strong>RSS Feeds for Scholarly Authors</strong></strong>. With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OPML</a> we also have a standard format to aggregate multiple RSS feeds, and this is true not only for journal RSS feeds, but also author RSS feeds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is one missing piece in this workflow: turning ORCID profiles into RSS feeds. At the <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/trading-knowledge/2012/11/13/solo-hackday/">SpotOn London hackathon</a> last November I worked with <a href="http://twitter.com/easternblot">Eva Amsen</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/graemedmoffat">Graeme Moffat</a> to hack this workflow together using available tools. But we really need a more mature solution. Until RSS feeds are provided by the core ORCID service - and there is so much other stuff to do right now that this will take time - the best solution might be a web service that turns ORCID profiles into scholarly RSS as described above for journal articles.</p>
<p>Today I finally came around implementing a first version of this - hacking together a Ruby Sinatra application hosted on Amazon Web Services (<a href="http://hack4ac.com/">#hack4ac</a> attendees know why). The application takes an ORCID ID (e.g. mine: <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.rss">http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/0000-0003-1419-2405.rss</a>) and returns an RSS feed. The first version just returns just the name and biography from the profile, but I only started working on this today. ORCID Feed can be found at <a href="http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org/">http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org</a> and the source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/orcid-feed">Github</a>. Please add suggestions and comments to the Github issue tracker <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/orcid-feed/issues">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Update 7/28/13</strong></strong>: <em>I’ve added publications to the output, and additional content types. Use them as extension (e.g. <code>.json</code>), as format parameter (e.g. <code>?format=rss</code>), or use an accept-header, e.g. <code>Accept: application/x-bibtex</code>. I’ve also added basic error checking with cleanup of names and removal of duplicates.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>html (the default): forward to profile on the ORCID website</li>
<li>rss - RSS feed</li>
<li>bib - bibtex file</li>
<li>json - Citeproc JSON</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A keynote is a presentation typically given at a start of a conference that sets the central theme for the event. A keynote speaker usually has more time (45-60 min) than other presenters, and has the full attention of everyone attending the conference. The keynotes at the conferences I attended the last several years (mostly scholarly communication conferences) seem to work like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>find a prominent speaker, ideally not a core member of the community attending the conference</li>
<li>tell him to talk about something he knows a lot about, not necessarily a central theme of the conference</li>
<li>the keynote should be inspiring and eye-opening, instead of focussing on the conference</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with this approach is that it focusses too much on the <em>prominent speaker</em> and it runs the risk of the keynote speaker talking about what he always talks about. Meaning that we don’t learn much if we have heard the keynote speaker before. Which is too bad, because keynotes should contain things that are unexpected and exciting.</p>
<p>One of the best keynotes I had the pleasure of listening to in the last several years was the one given by <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/">Michael Nielsen</a> at <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/">Science Online London 2011</a> (disclaimer: I was one of the conference organizers). Not only is Michael a very good speaker, but his presentation about <strong><strong>Open Science</strong></strong> fit perfectly into the conference, and it was clear that he had made the presentation specifically for this conference (with an audience that knows a lot about Open Science). One of the main themes of his presentation – the <em>collective action problem</em>, or to get started with something that benefits everyone, but where there is a cost doing the first step - is something I later picked up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1629/24277">in a publication</a> about the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (Fenner, Gomez, &amp; Thorisson, 2011).</p>

<p><em>Keynote by Michael Nielsen at the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/">Science Online London 2011 Conference</a>, video recording and editing by <a href="http://river-valley.tv/keynote-solo2011/">River Valley TV</a>.</em></p>
<p>Luckily we increasingly have video recordings of keynote presentations available online, making it easier to listen to the good presentations. <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx">TED and TEDx</a> have of course made the format of recordings of carefully prepared talks popular. For large scholarly and academic conferences the best starting point is <a href="http://river-valley.tv/">River Valley TV</a>. The <a href="http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/">Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting</a> has hundreds of presentations by Nobel laureates. And as video recording and streaming has become easier technically (e.g. with <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.de/2011/09/google-92-93-94-95-96-97-98-99-100.html">Google Hangouts on Air</a>), recording good keynotes should become the norm and not the exception.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Figures are an important part of any scientific document. While the kind of figure commonly used obviously varies between disciplines, charts are an important part of many publications. There are two problems in how charts are currently used:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data used to draw the chart are not available or difficult to obtain</li>
<li>charts are drawn as static images with no interactivity, e.g. to see the values of individual data points</li>
</ul>
<p>Ross Mounce and others did a <strong><strong>Figures → Data</strong></strong> project at the recent <a href="http://hacka4ac.com/">hack4ac</a> to extract data from figures, described in a <a href="http://rossmounce.co.uk/2013/07/09/hack4ac-recap/">blog post</a>. The experience was painful, even though they started with a <em>really</em> simple chart.</p>
<p>While we should of course <a href="http://datadryad.org/">publish all data associated with a paper</a>, the smarter strategy to overcome the two limitations above would be to embed the data used for a chart directly into the document. We have many tools that can accomplish this, and I have given an example using R in an <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/17/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">earlier blog post</a>. The problem is the sometimes steep learning curve.</p>
<p>One approach is to build an easy-to use online tool, and <a href="http://datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> is exactly that:</p>
<blockquote>
An open source tool helping anyone to create simple, correct and embeddable charts in minutes.
</blockquote>
<p>Datawrapper uses the <strong><strong>d3.js</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Highcharts</strong></strong> Javascript libraries for data visualizations, and the service is easy to use. It took me for example about 15 min to generate the chart below. The data used for the chart are embedded (click <strong><strong>Get the data</strong></strong>) and you can hover over the chart to see the actual numbers by month.</p>
<p>Most journal articles see the highest usage immediately after publication, and the light purple line shows this pattern for Darcy et al. (2009). The dark purple line for Moher et al. (2009) – published on the same day – on the other hand shows a highly unusual usage pattern, as the usage actually increases over time, starting about 1 1/2 years after publication. The article is a guideline for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and is now viewed more often than directly after publication four years ago.</p>
<p>Datawrapper does three things: it makes it easy to generate charts, it allows you to embed them directly into your webpage (using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag), and it is Open Source software (MIT license, Github repo <a href="https://github.com/datawrapper/datawrapper">here</a>) so that you can help improve the code and host this service on your own. DataWrapper was written in Javascript and PHP by a group of German journalists, and the main focus is data journalism where the service has become really <a href="http://blog.datawrapper.de/2013/datawrapper-crosses-mark-of-10-million-visits/">popular</a> with more than 3.5 million views of embedded charts in May 2013 alone.</p>
<p>Datawrapper is a perfect tool for science blogs and websites with scientific content, but it can also enhance the charts in scientific articles. We need a few additional chart types, error bars and more flexible labeling. And we might want to add a license picker, making it easy to add a Creative Commons license so that it is clear how the chart can be reused. Datawrapper is intended for online use, but the service can also save the charts as PNG or PDF. We would want to add saving to SVG (already used for online rendering) for easier embedding into the XML and ePub versions of articles.</p>

<p>Altmetrics track the impact of scholarly works in the social web. Article-Level Metrics focuses on articles, but also looks at traditional citations and usage statistics. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics</a> project was started in 2008. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics manifesto</a> was published in October 2010 and described the fundamental ideas. By October 2011 we had a number of altmetrics tools, fueled by the Mendeley/PLOS API <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/">programming contest</a>. In 2012 the focus shifted from the fact that we can provide these numbers to a discussion of the many open questions. We could see this at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/06/25/random-notes-from-the-altmetrics12-conference/">altmetrics12 conference</a> in June, and even more so at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/">altmetrics workshop</a> hosted by PLOS last week in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Altmetrics can provide a large amount of information about the post-publication activity around an article (and other scholarly content), and this is exciting, but at the same time also somewhat overwhelming and scary. Some of the things that we as a community have to figure out include standards for collecting, aggregating and displaying altmetrics data, strategies to combat attempts to game these metrics, and finding appropriate ways for the different organizations providing altmetrics to work together as a community. These and other topics were discussed in great detail at the PLOS altmetrics workshop, and we made excellent progress not least thanks to the excellent moderation by <em>Cameron Neylon</em>. The third day of the workshop was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/altmetrics-hackathon">hackathon</a>, and we were able to translate some of the ideas into prototypes of new tools.</p>
<p>The most important conclusion from the workshop for me personally was that we should really should focus on use cases. Altmetrics should help answer questions that we can’t answer today, and despite the promise, the various altmetrics tools still have a log way to go. A case in point is the promise that altmetrics can make it easier to find relevant scholarly content. We all use social media to help us find papers and other stuff, but integration of altmetrics into the traditional scholarly search tools is still missing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://rerank.it/">ReRank</a> is a cool prototype developed during the hackathon last Saturday, but we are still a long way from having altmetrics feeding directly into the relevance sorting of search results.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in the back of mind, I look forward to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-altmetrics-beyond-the-numbers/">altmetrics session</a> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/in/london/">SpotOn London conference</a> this Sunday afternoon. <em>Sarah Venis</em> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.msf.org/">Médecins sans Frontières</a> (MSF) will talk about the questions that she hopes altmetrics can answer for her organization. MSF is very interested to look beyond citations for the impact of their publications, as their primary target audience is not really the scholarly community, but rather people in need in various parts of the world. <em>Marie Boran</em> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.deri.ie/about/team/member/marie_boran/">Digital Research Enterprise Institute</a> (DERI) is interested in using altmetrics as a recommendation tool to find researchers with similar interests. <em>Euan Adie</em> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a> and I (technical lead for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics project</a>) will use our respective tools to try to answer some of these questions. For me altmetrics are primarily tools to tell a good story, and that is one reason why we picked the title <em>Altmetrics beyond the Numbers</em> for this session. The focus of the session will then shift to an open discussion, and I hope we can get some good answers to this and other questions.</p>
<p>A clear focus on use cases should go a long way to reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed by all the numbers that altmetrics can provide. If we have specific goals for which we need altmetrics, it becomes much easier to decide what numbers work best for us, what standards we need and whom to ask to collect this information. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-altmetrics-everywhere-but-what-are-we-missing-solo12impact/">AJ Cann</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2012/11/08/understanding-the-limits-of-altmetrics-slideshare-statistics/">Brian Kelly</a> have written two excellent blog post about the confusion that too many altmetrics numbers can create, and the workshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-assessing-social-media-impact/">Assessing Social Media Impact</a> during SpotOn London addresses some of these questions.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago Kafkas et al. (2013) published a paper looking at current patterns of how datasets o biological databases are cited in research articles, based on an analysis of the full text Open Access articles available from Europe PMC. They identified data citations by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accession numbers available in articles as publisher-supplied, structured content;</li>
<li>Accession numbers identified in articles by text mining;</li>
<li>References to articles from the ENA, UniProt and PDBe records.</li>
</ol>
<p>They could show that text mining doubles the number of structured annotations available in journal articles (from 2.26% to 5.15%), and that these structured annotations should be extended beyond the ENA, UniProt and PDB identifiers that their analysis focused on. ENA identifiers (for nucleotide sequences in GenBank, EMBL or DDBJ) make up the largest group, with 160,112 identifiers found in the 410,364 articles that were analyzed.</p>

Fig. 3 from <span class="citation" data-cites="Kafkas:2013fp" style="box-sizing: border-box;">(Kafkas et al., 2013)</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another result in the paper is that references to articles in these databases show little overlap with database links found in articles. One of the conclusions drawn by the author is that</p>
<blockquote>
Text-mining can be used to extend structured data citation, and could be a basis for the development of services to help authors or editors to add structured content at the beginning of the publication process, rather than after the fact.
</blockquote>
<p>Adding structured data citations during the authoring phase of a manuscript requires tools that make this process easier, providing auto-linking and verification of the without requiring extra input from the author. Scholarly Markdown is an ideal platform for these tools, as it is easier to extend than traditional word processors such as Microsoft Word. During a small workshop around persistent identifiers for data (<a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a>), people (<a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) and geological samples (<a href="http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout">IGSN</a>) that took place yesterday and today at the <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/cegit">GFZ Potsdam</a> I worked on a tool that does auto-linking for these identifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>IGSN. <a href="http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout">International Geosample Number</a></li>
<li>MGI identifiers for genetically modified mouse strains in the <a href="http://www.findmice.org/about">Internal Mouse Strain Resource</a></li>
<li>ENA. <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/about">Genbank / ENA / DDBJ nucleotide sequences</a></li>
<li>UniProt protein sequences from the <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/about">UniProt database</a></li>
<li>PDB. <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=home/faq.html">Protein Data Bank protein structure information</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The list includes the IGSN, the database identifiers studied by Kafkas et al (2013), and the MGI identifier for genetically altered mice. In the life sciences there is a long tradition - and requirement by journals - to use database identifiers for data, but identifiers for resources such as genetically modified mice are unfortunately not in common use.</p>
<p>This blog uses the Pandoc markdown processor and the Jekyll static website generator. The easiest way to implement this functionality was by writing a filter for the liquid templating engine used by Jekyll, and provide this filter as a Jekyll plugin. The Jekyll plugin can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-scholmd">mfenner/jekyll-scholmd</a>. The plugin expects the name of the identifier, followed by a colon and optional space, followed by the identifier:</p>
<pre><code>GenBank:  M10090
IGSN:  JRH964436
MGI:  96922

<p>The plugin was written in a few hours today, and is my first Jekyll plugin. There is room for improvement, e.g. support for more identifiers, better regex matching, validation of the resulting links, and automated tag generation if an identifier is found. Ideally the auto-linking should happen in the markdown and not the HTML output, so that these structured database links are also available in other markdown outputs such as PDF. But this is another example how Scholarly Markdown can make it easier for researchers to author documents without requiring a fancy web-based user interface.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scholarly documents often need metadata that describe them: typically author(s), title and location (DOI or URL), but possibly many other things. For some metadata it makes sense to store them in the document text, e.g. as is typically done for citations. The problem is that this can make it hard to make the metadata machine-readable. The worst place for metadata is of course outside of the document, and unfortunately that it is the most common way of doing this. Two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manuscript submission. Papers submitted to scholarly journals contain the metadata in the text, but authors are required to enter the information again into a webform. You can add metadata (<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/word-help/add-property-information-to-a-document-HA010163766.aspx">property information</a>) to Microsoft Word documents, but it seems that nobody is doing it.</li>
<li>PDFs and image files. Even though we have at least one good standard with <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/">XMP</a> to store metadata in these documents, it is not a common practice. Information about these documents is therefore stored somewhere else and doesn’t automatically travel with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best place for metadata is the document itself, and the metadata should be stored in machine-readable format. Another requirement is flexibility in what we can store, and we shouldn’t limit ourselves to a predefined list. Pandoc for example allows only three attributes in the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">title block</a>:</p>
<pre><code>% title
% author(s) (separated by semicolons)
% date</code></pre>
<p>For Scholarly Markdown we have another requirement: the metadata should be writeable and readable by humans. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> is the perfect format for this. JSON is closely related to YAML (and is in fact a subset of YAML 1.2), but YAML can also be written with whitespace instead of curly braces. The static website generator Jekyll - which I use to parse the markdown for this blog into HTML - uses YAML at the beginning of markdown documents to store metadata, and we can easily extend this functionality. Carl Boettinger posted a comment yesterday saying that YAML support is on the Pandoc development roadmap.</p>
<p>Below is the YAML for (Ethan P. White, 2013), where I reposted a paper written in markdown:</p>

<p>You can see that the author information required for manuscript submission can easily be written in YAML (email addresses were removed to protect privacy). JSON is also possible for people where this is a better fit into their workflow, but it is more difficult to write for humans because of the curly braces, and because all strings need to be in double quotes.</p>
<p>Once the ORCID Registry <a href="http://orcid.org/blog/2013/06/27/orcid-plans-launch-affiliation-module-using-isni-and-ringgold-organization">adds affiliation</a> information, we no longer need to provide email and affiliation when submitting manuscripts. I have stored my own name, orcid, email and affiliation in my site configuration file so that I don’t have to provide this info for every blog post.</p>
<p>In this blog markdown files are currently only processed to HTML, and I store the metadata in HTML <code>meta</code> tags in a <a href="http://www.monperrus.net/martin/accurate+bibliographic+metadata+and+google+scholar">format</a> used by many sites and services, including Google Scholar - look at the source code of Ethan P. White et al. (2013) for an example. These metadata are also understood by the <a href="http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/2071">Greycite service</a> built by Phil Lord and Lindsay Marshall that generates citation information for weblinks, adding important metadata such as title, authors and publication_date so that we can properly cite our blog post (Ethan P. White, 2013).</p>
<p>And I use the metadata to link the author names to their ORCID profile (if they have an ORCID) or email address, with the affiliation visible when you hover over the name. My own name is linked to the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About</a> page of this site, but with a little development effort I could automatically add all my publications (and other works) in my ORCID profile to that page.</p>
<p>Metadata are important, and Scholarly Markdown makes it easy to embed them.</p>
<p><em>Update 06/30/13: added JSON example to demonstrate the differences to YAML, and to show that Jekyll also works with JSON (used in this blog post, and tested with the examples above which produce identical HTML output).

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Sharing data is increasingly considered to be an important part of the scientific process. Making your data publicly available allows original results to be reproduced and new analyses to be conducted. While sharing your data is the first step in allowing reuse, it is also important that the data be easy to understand and use. We describe nine simple ways to make it easy to reuse the data that you share and also make it easier to work with it yourself. Our recommendations focus on making your data understandable, easy to analyze, and readily available to the wider community of scientists.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sharing data is increasingly recognized as an important component of the scientific process (Whitlock, McPeek, Rausher, Rieseberg, &amp; Moore, 2010). The sharing of scientific data is beneficial because it allows replication of research results and reuse in meta-analyses and projects not originally intended by the data collectors (Poisot, Mounce, &amp; Gravel, 2013). In ecology and evolutionary biology, sharing occurs through a combination of formal data repositories like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a> and <a href="http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>, and through individual and institutional websites.</p>
<p>While data sharing is increasingly common and straightforward, much of the shared data in ecology and evolutionary biology are not easily reused because they do not follow best practices in terms of data structure, metadata, and licensing (M. B. Jones, Schildhauer, Reichman, &amp; Bowers, 2006). This makes it more difficult to work with existing data and therefore makes the data less useful than it could be (M. B. Jones et al., 2006; O. J. Reichman, Jones, &amp; Schildhauer, 2011). Here we provide a list of 9 simple ways to make it easier to reuse the data that you share.</p>
<p>Our recommendations focus on making your data understandable, easy to work with, and available to the wider community of scientists. They are designed to be simple and straightforward to implement, and as such represent an introduction to good data practices rather than a comprehensive treatment. We contextualize our recommendations with examples from ecology and evolutionary biology, though many of the recommendations apply broadly across scientific disciplines. Following these recommendations makes it easier for anyone to reuse your data including other members of your lab and even yourself.</p>
<h2 id="1-share-your-data">1. Share your data</h2>
<p>The first and most important step in sharing your data is to share your data. The recommendations below will help make your data more useful, but sharing it in any form is a big step forward. So, why should you share your data?</p>
<p>Data sharing provides substantial benefits to the scientific community (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985). It allows</p>
<ol>
<li>the results of existing analyses to be reproduced and improved upon (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985; Poisot et al., 2013),</li>
<li>data to be combined in meta-analyses to reach general conclusions (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985),</li>
<li>new approaches to be applied to the data and new questions asked using it (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985), and</li>
<li>approaches to scientific inquiry that couldn’t even be considered without broad scale data sharing (Hampton et al., 2013).</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, data sharing is increasingly required by funding agencies (Poisot et al. (2013); e.g., <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">NSF</a>, <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html">NIH</a>, <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/FinancialAdminGuide-GuideAdminFinancier/Responsibilities-Responsabilites_eng.asp">NSERC</a>, <a href="http://www.fwf.ac.at/en/public_relations/oai/index.html">FWF</a>), journals (Whitlock et al., 2010), and potentially by law (e.g. <a href="http://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/2013%2002%2014%20DOYLE%20FASTR%20FINAL.pdf">FASTR</a>).</p>
<p>Despite these potential benefits to the community, many scientists are still reluctant to share data. This reluctance is largely due to perceived fears of 1) competition for publications based on the shared data, 2) technical barriers, and 3) a lack of recognition for sharing data (Hampton et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2004). These concerns are often not as serious as they first appear, and the minimal costs associated with data sharing are frequently offset by individual benefits to the data sharer (Hampton et al., 2013; Parr &amp; Cummings, 2005). Many data sharing initiatives allow for data embargoes or limitations on direct competition that can last for several years while the authors develop their publications and thus avoid competition for deriving publications from the data. Also, logistical barriers to data sharing are diminishing as data archives become increasingly common and easy to use (Hampton et al., 2013; Parr &amp; Cummings, 2005). Datasets are now considered citable entities and data providers receive recognition in the form of increased citation metrics and credit on CVs and grant applications (Heather A Piwowar &amp; Vision, 2013; Heather A. Piwowar, Day, &amp; Fridsma, 2007; Poisot et al., 2013). In addition to increased citation rates, shared datasets that are documented and standardized are also more easily reused in the future by the original investigator. As a result, it is increasingly beneficial to the individual researcher to share data in the most useful manner possible.</p>
<h2 id="2-provide-metadata">2. Provide metadata</h2>
<p>The first key to using data is understanding it. Metadata is information about the data including how it was collected, what the units of measurement are, and descriptions of how to best use the data. Clear metadata makes it easier to figure out if a dataset is appropriate for a project. It also makes data easier to use by both the original investigators and by other scientists by making it easy to figure out how to work with the data. Without clear metadata, datasets can be overlooked or not used due to the difficulty of understanding the data (Fraser &amp; Gluck, 1999; A. S. Zimmerman, 2003), and the data becomes less useful over time (Michener, Brunt, Helly, Kirchner, &amp; Stafford, 1997).</p>
<p>Metadata can take several forms, including descriptive file and column names, a written description of the data, images (<em>i.e.,</em> maps, photographs), and specially structured information that can be read by computers. Good metadata should provide 1) the what, when, where, and how of data collection, 2) how to find and access the data, 3) suggestions on the suitability of the data for answering specific questions, 4) warnings about known problems or inconsistencies in the data, and 5) information to check that the data are properly imported, such as the number of rows and columns in the dataset and the total sum of numerical columns (Michener et al., 1997; Strasser, Cook, Michener, &amp; Budden, 2012; A. S. Zimmerman, 2003).</p>
<p>Just like any other scientific publication, metadata should be logically organized, complete, and clear enough to enable interpretation and use of the data (A. Zimmerman, 2007). Specific metadata standards exist (<em>e.g.,</em> Ecological Metadata Language <a href="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/">EML</a>, Directory Interchange Format <a href="http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/add/difguide/index.html">DIF</a>, Darwin Core <a href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/">DWC</a> (Wieczorek et al., 2012), Dublin Core Metadata Initiative <a href="http://dublincore.org/metadata-basics/">DCMI</a>, Federal Geographic Data Committee <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards">FGDC</a> (O. J. Reichman et al., 2011; Whitlock, 2011). These standards are designed to provide consistency in metadata across different datasets and also to allow computers to interpret the metadata automatically. This allows broader and more efficient use of shared data (Brunt, McCartney, Baker, &amp; Stafford, 2002; M. B. Jones et al., 2006). While following these standards is valuable, the most important thing is to have metadata at all.</p>
<p>You don’t need to spend a lot of extra time to write good metadata. The easiest way to develop metadata is to start describing your data during the planning and data collection stages. This will help you stay organized, make it easier to work with your data after it has been collected, and make eventual publication of the data easier. If you decide to take the extra step and follow metadata standards, there are tools designed to make this easier including: <a href="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morpho%20portal.jsp">KNB Morpho</a>, <a href="http://geology.usgs.gov/tools/metadata/tools/doc/xtme.html">USGS xtme</a>, and <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/documents/workbook_0501_bmk.pdf">FGDC workbook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-provide-an-unprocessed-form-of-the-data">3. Provide an unprocessed form of the data</h2>
<p>Often, the data used in scientific analyses are modified in some way from the original form in which they were collected. This is done to address the questions of interest in the best manner possible and to address common limitations associated with the raw data. However, the best way to process data depends on the question being asked and corrections for common data limitations often change as better approaches are developed. It can also be very difficult to combine data from multiple sources that have each been processed in different ways. Therefore, to make your data as useful as possible it is best to share the data in as raw a form as possible.</p>
<p>This is not to say that your data are best suited for analysis in the raw form, but providing it in the raw form gives data users the most flexibility. Of course, your work to develop and process the data is also very important and can be quite valuable for other scientists using your data. This is particularly true when correcting data for common limitations. Providing both the raw and processed forms of the data, and clearly explaining the differences between them in the metadata, is an easy way to include the benefits of both data forms. An alternate approach is to share the unprocessed data along with the code that process the data to the form you used for analysis. This allows other scientists to assess and potentially modify the process by which you arrived at the values used in your analysis.</p>
<h2 id="4-use-standard-data-formats">4. Use standard data formats</h2>
<p>Everyone has their own favorite tools for storing and analyzing data. To make it easy to use your data it is best to store it in a standard format that can be used by many different kinds of software. Good standard formats include the type of file, the overall structure of the data, and the specific contents of the file.</p>
<h3 id="use-standard-file-formats">Use standard file formats</h3>
<p>You should use file formats that are readable by most software and, when possible, are non-proprietary (Borer, Seabloom, Jones, &amp; Schildhauer, 2009; Strasser, Cook, Michener, Budden, &amp; Koskela, 2011; Strasser et al., 2012). Certain kinds of data in ecology and evolution have well established standard formats such as <a href="http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/FASTA/">FASTA</a> files for nucleotide or peptide sequences and the <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html">Newick files</a> for phylogenetic trees. Use these well defined formats when they exist, because that is what other scientists and most existing software will be able to work with most easily.</p>
<p>Data that does not have a well defined standard format is often stored in tables. Tabular data should be stored in a format that can be opened by any type of software to increase reuseability of the data, i.e. text files. These text files use delimiters to indicate different columns. Commas are the most commonly used delimiter (i.e., comma-delimited text files with the .csv extension). Tabs can also be used as a delimiter, although problems can occur in displaying the data correctly when importing data from one program to another. In contrast to plain text files, proprietary formats such as those used by Microsoft Excel (e.g, .xls, .xlsx) can be difficult to load into other programs. In addition, these types of files can become obsolete, eventually making it difficult to open the data files at all if the newer versions of the software no longer support the original format (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012).</p>
<p>When naming files you should use descriptive names so that it is easy to keep track of what data they contain (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012). If there are multiple files in a dataset, name them in a consistent manner to make it easier to automate working with them. You should also avoid spaces in file names, which can cause problems for some software (Borer et al., 2009). Spaces in file names can be avoided by using camel case (e.g, RainAvg) or by separating the words with underscores (e.g., rain_avg).</p>
<h3 id="use-standard-table-formats">Use standard table formats</h3>
<p>Data tables are ubiquitous in ecology and evolution. Tabular data provides a great deal of flexibility in how to structure the data, which makes it easy to structure the data in a way that is difficult to (re)use. We provide three simple recommendations to help ensure that tabular data are properly structured to allow the data to be easily imported and analyzed by most data management systems and common analysis software, such as R and Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each row should represent a single observation (i.e., a record) and each column should represent a single variable or type of measurement (i.e., a field) (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012). This is the standard format for tables in the most commonly used database management systems and analysis packages and makes the data easy to work with in the most general way.</li>
<li>Every cell should contain only a single value (Strasser et al., 2012). For example, do not include units in the cell with the values (Figure 1) or include multiple measurements in a single cell, and break taxonomic information up into single components with one column each for family, genus, species, subspecies, etc. Violating this rule makes it difficult to process or analyze your data using standard tools, because there is no easy way for the software to treat the items within a cell as separate pieces of information.</li>
<li>There should only be one column for each type of information (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2011, 2012). The most common violation of this rule is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_tabulation">cross-tab structured data</a>, where different columns contain measurements of the same variable (e.g., in different sites, treatments, etc.; Figure 1).</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/Data_formatting.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Figure 1. Examples of how to restructure two common issues with tabular data. (a) Each cell should only contain a single value. If more than one value is present then the data should be split into multiple columns. (b) There should be only one column for each type of information. If there are multiple columns then the column header should be stored in one column and the values from each column should be stored in a single column." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><strong>Figure 1. Examples of how to restructure two common issues with tabular data</strong>. (a) Each cell should only contain a single value. If more than one value is present then the data should be split into multiple columns. (b) There should be only one column for each type of information. If there are multiple columns then the column header should be stored in one column and the values from each column should be stored in a single column.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While cross-tab data can be useful for its readability, and may be appropriate for data collection, this format makes it difficult to link the records with additional data (e.g., the location and environmental conditions at a site) and it cannot be properly used by most common database management and analysis tools (e.g., relational databases, dataframes in R and Python, etc.). If tabular data are currently in a cross-tab structure, there are tools to help restructure the data including functions in Excel, R (e.g., melt() function in the R package reshape; Wickham (2007)), and Python (e.g., melt() function in the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> Python module.</p>
<p>In addition to following these basic rules you should also make sure to use descriptive column names (Borer et al., 2009). Descriptive column names make the data easier to understand and therefore make data interpretation errors less likely. As with file names, spaces can cause problems for some software and should be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="use-standard-formats-within-cells">Use standard formats within cells</h3>
<p>In addition to using standard table structures it is also important to ensure that the contents of each cell don’t cause problems for data management and analysis software. Specifically, we recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be consistent. For example, be consistent in your capitalization of words, choice of delimiters, and naming conventions for variables.</li>
<li>Avoid special characters. Most software for storing and analyzing data works best on plain text, and accents and other special characters can make it difficult to import your data (Borer et al., 2009; Strasser et al., 2012).</li>
<li>Avoid using your delimiter in the data itself (e.g., commas in the notes filed of a comma-delimited file). This can make it difficult to import your data properly. This means that if you are using commas as the decimal separator (as is often done in continental Europe) then you should use a non-comma delimiter (e.g., a tab).</li>
<li>When working with dates use the YYYY-MM-DD format (i.e., follow the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/iso8601">ISO 8601</a> data standard).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-use-good-null-values">5. Use good null values</h2>
<p>Most ecological and evolutionary datasets contain missing or empty data values. Working with this kind of “null” data can be difficult, especially when the null values are indicated in problematic ways. Unfortunately, there are many different ways to indicate a missing/empty value, and very little agreement on which approach to use.</p>
<p>We recommend choosing a null value that is both compatible with most software and unlikely to cause errors in analyses (Table 1). The null value that is most compatible with the software commonly used by biologists is the blank (i.e., nothing; Table 1). Blanks are automatically treated as null values by R, Python, SQL, and Excel. They are also easily spotted in a visual examination of the data. Note that a blank involves entering nothing, it is not a space, so if you use this option make sure there aren’t any hidden spaces. There are two potential issues with blanks that should be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can be difficult to know if a value is missing or was overlooked during data entry.</li>
<li>They can be confusing when spaces or tabs are used as delimiters in text files.</li>
</ol>
<p>NA and NULL are reasonable null values, but they are only handled automatically by a subset of commonly used software (Table 1). NA can also be problematic if it is also used as an abbreviation (e.g., North America, Namibia, <em>Neotoma albigula</em>, sodium, etc.). We recommend against using numerical values to indicate nulls (e.g., 999, -999, etc.) because they typically require an extra step to remove from analyses and can be accidentally included in calculations. We also recommend against using non-standard text indications (e.g., No data, ND, missing, —) because they can cause issues with software that requires consistent data types within columns). Whichever null value that you use, only use one, use it consistently throughout the data set, and indicate it clearly in the metadata.</p>

<h2 id="6-make-it-easy-to-combine-your-data-with-other-datasets">6. Make it easy to combine your data with other datasets</h2>
<p>Ecological and evolutionary data are often most valuable when combined with other kinds of data (e.g., taxonomic, environmental). You can make it easier to combine your data with other data sources by including the data that is common across many data sources (e.g., Latin binomials, latitudes and longitudes) It is common for data to include codes or abbreviations. For example, in ecology and evolution codes often appear in place of site locations or taxonomy. This is useful because it reduces data entry (e.g., DS instead of <em>Dipodomys spectabilis</em>) and redundancy (a single column for a species ID rather than separate columns for family, genus, and species). However, without clear definitions these codes can be difficult to understand and make it more difficult to connect your data with external sources. The easiest way to link your data to other datasets is to include additional tables that contain a column for the code and additional columns that describe the item in the standard way. For example, you might include a table with the species codes followed by their most current family, genus, and specific epithet. For site location, you could include a table with the site code followed by latitude and longitude. Linked tables can also be used to include additional information about your data, such as spatial extent, temporal duration, and other appropriate details.</p>
<h2 id="7-perform-basic-quality-control">7. Perform basic quality control</h2>
<p>Data, just like any other scientific product, should undergo some level of quality control (O. J. Reichman et al., 2011). This is true regardless of whether you plan to share the data because quality control will make it easier to analyze your own data and decrease the chance of making mistakes. However, it is particularly important for data that will be shared because scientists using the data won’t be familiar with quirks in the data and how to work around them.</p>
<p>At its most basic, quality control can consist of a few quick sanity checks of the data. More advanced quality control can include automated checks on data as it is entered and double-entry of data (Lampe &amp; Weiler, 1998; Paulsen, Overgaard, &amp; Lauritsen, 2012). This additional effort can be time consuming, but is valuable because it increases data accuracy by catching typographical errors, reader/recorder error, out-of-range values, and questionable data in general (Lampe &amp; Weiler, 1998; Paulsen et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Before sharing your data we recommend performing a quick “data review”. Start by performing some basic sanity checks on your data. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a column should contain numeric values, check that there are no non-numeric values in the data.</li>
<li>Check that empty cells actually represent missing data, and not mistakes in data entry, and indicate that they are empty using the appropriate null values (see recommendation 6).</li>
<li>Check for consistency in unit of measurement, data type (e.g., numeric, character), naming scheme (e.g., taxonomy, location), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>These checks can be performed by carefully looking at the data or can be automated using common programming and analysis tools like R or Python.</p>
<p>Then ask someone else to look over your metadata and data and provide you with feedback about anything they didn’t understand. In the same way that friendly reviews of papers can help catch mistakes and identify confusing sections of papers, a friendly review of data can help identify problems and things that are unclear in the data and metadata.</p>
<h2 id="8-use-an-established-repository">8. Use an established repository</h2>
<p>For data sharing to be effective, data should be easy to find, accessible, and stored where it will be preserved for a long time (Kowalczyk &amp; Shankar, 2011). To make your data (and associated code) visible and easily accessible, and to ensure a permanent link to a well maintained website, we suggest depositing your data in one of the major well-established repositories. This guarantees that the data will be available in the same location for a long time, in contrast to personal and institutional websites that do not guarantee the long-term persistence of the data. There are repositories available for sharing almost any type of biological or environmental data. Repositories that host specific data types, such as molecular sequences (e.g., DDBJ, GenBank, MG-RAST), are often highly standardized in data type, format, and quality control approaches. Other repositories host a wide array of data types and are less standardized (e.g., Dryad, KNB, PANGAEA). In addition to the repositories focused on the natural sciences there are also all purpose repositories where data of any kind can be shared (e.g., figshare).</p>
<p>When choosing a repository you should consider where other researchers in your discipline are sharing their data. This helps you quickly identify the community’s standard approach to sharing and increases the likelihood that other scientists will discover your data. In particular, if there is a centralized repository for a specific kind of data (e.g., GenBank for sequence data) then you should use that repository.</p>
<p>In cases where there is no <em>de facto</em> standard it is worth considering differences among repositories in terms of use, data rights, and licensing (Table 2) and whether your funding agency or journal has explicit requirements or restrictions related to repositories. We also recommend that you use a repository that allows your dataset to be easily cited. Most repositories will describe how this works, but an easy way to guarantee that your data are citable is to confirm that the repository associates it with a persistent identifier, the most popular of which is the digital object identifier (DOI). DOIs are permanent unique identifiers that are independent of physical location and site ownership. There are also online tools for finding good repositories for your data including <a href="http://databib.org/">Databib</a> and <a href="http://re3data.org/">re3data</a>.</p>

<h2 id="9-use-an-established-and-liberal-license">9. Use an established and liberal license</h2>
<p>Including an explicit license with your data is the best way to let others know exactly what they can and cannot do with the data you shared. Following the <a href="http://pantonprinciples.org/">Panton Principles</a> we recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using well established licenses in order to clearly communicate the rights and responsibilities of both the people providing the data and the people using it.</li>
<li>Using the most open license possible, because even minor restrictions on data use can have unintended consequences for the reuse of the data (Poisot et al., 2013; Schofield et al., 2009).</li>
</ol>
<p>The Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) places no restrictions on data use and is considered by many to be one of the best license for sharing data (e.g., (Poisot et al., 2013; Schofield et al., 2009), <a href="http://blog.datadryad.org/2011/10/05/why-does-dryad-use-cc0/">Why does Dryad use CC0</a>). Having a clear and open license will increase the chance that other scientists will be comfortable using your data.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h2>
<p>Data sharing has the potential to transform the way we conduct ecological and evolutionary research (Fienberg &amp; Martin, 1985; Poisot et al., 2013; Whitlock et al., 2010). As a result, there are an increasing number of initiatives at the federal, funding agency, and journal levels to encourage or require the sharing of the data associated with scientific research (Heather A Piwowar &amp; Chapman, 2008; Poisot et al., 2013; Whitlock et al., 2010). However, making the data available is only the first step. To make data sharing as useful as possible it is necessary to make the data usable with as little effort as possible (M. B. Jones et al., 2006; O. J. Reichman et al., 2011). This allows scientists to spend their time doing science rather than cleaning up data.</p>
<p>We have provided a list of 9 practices that require only a small additional time investment but substantially improve the usability of data. These practices can be broken down into three major groups.</p>
<ol>
<li>Well documented data are easier to understand.</li>
<li>Properly formatted data are easier to use in a variety of software.</li>
<li>Data that is shared in established repositories with open licenses is easier for others to find and use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these recommendations are simply good practice for working with data regardless of whether that data are shared or not. This means that following these recommendations (2-7) make the data easier to work with for anyone, including you. This is particularly true when returning to your own data for further analysis months or years after you originally collected or analyzed it. In addition, data sharing often occurs within a lab or research group. Good data sharing practices make these in-house collaborations faster, easier, and less dependent on lab members who may have graduated or moved on to other things.</p>
<p>By following these practices we can assure that the data collected in ecology and evolution can be used to its full potential to improve our understanding of biological systems.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the post last week and the crazy discussion that followed I would understand that you feel you have heard enough about citations in markdown.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/19/citations-in-scholarly-markdown/">post last week</a> and the crazy discussion that followed I would understand that you feel you have heard enough about citations in markdown. But I had the feeling last week that something was still missing, and I have done some more thinking. What we have so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pandoc has nice support for citations, including Citation Style Language support (i.e. it is using the same 5000+ citation styles as Zotero, Mendeley and Papers).</li>
<li>Pandoc requires a separate file to store the citations, typically in bibtex format. This is fine for some people, but can make the workflow complicated for short documents or when several people work on the bibliography at the same time.</li>
<li>Citations are similar to links, and we can use links for almost all the functionality we need, making it much easier to add citations to a text. The problem is a) citations that don’t include a weblink, b) being able to do this offline, and c) where in the HTML to store the citation metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I looked at how Wikipedia is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources">doing this</a>, and they use a) links, b) citations and c) footnotes. If Wikipedia thinks that it can’t do without citations and do everything as links, then maybe we also shouldn’t enforce this for scholarly texts.</p>
<p>I think what we need is the best of both worlds. We should use the Pandoc citation workflow, as it is similar to what we are used to from other authoring environments, and we get good citation style support, including more complex formatting of references. Some reference managers already support copy/paste of Pandoc citation keys. The inclusion of a bibtex file with a scholarly markdown text is also a bonus, as it allows the automated extraction of citations, e.g. by manuscript submission systems.</p>
<p>We also want to support a simpler solution for shorter texts or when people don’t want to use a separate bibtex file. Here we would add the citations as links, ideally in a syntax very similar to Pandoc citation keys:</p>
<pre><code>Johnson [@Johnson2006] didn&#39;t agree with ...

[@Johnson2006]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aris.201 &quot;Data sharing in the sciences&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We need to write a tool that parses the markdown before Pandoc, fetches the citation metadata for these links in bibtex format (e.g. using CrossRef Content Negotiation), and adds them to the existing bibtex file (or creates a new bibtex file). The next time the markdown is parsed, the citation is already “cached” in the bibtex file. Those people who don’t have such a tool would see the citation as link (<strong><strong>???</strong></strong>), with the essential information (DOI or URL) preserved so that a downstream tool can fetch the bibliographic information. Some people were worried about typos in DOIs and URLs. They can add additional information - e.g. the title of the paper - in double quotes to allow checking of the correct DOI.</p>
<p>This workflow now makes a lot of sense to me, as it uses existing solutions, but also allows for easy entering of citation information in a way similar to the <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</a> tools. As I use jekyll and am a Ruby developer, I will implement the citation parsing as a jekyll plugin.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One important outcome of the recent <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/workshop">Markdown for Science</a> workshop was an overall agreement that all the different implementations (or flavors) of markdown that currently exist are a big problem for the adoption of Scholarly Markdown and that we <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">need</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
A reference implementation with documentation and tests
</blockquote>
<p>As described by Karthik Ram (<a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/workshop">31 flavors is great for ice cream but not markdown</a>), <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/what-flavor-is-scholarly-markdown/@flavor">me</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-future-of-markdown.html">others</a>, there is really a large number of markdown implementations to choose from, including</p>
<ul>
<li>John Gruber’s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">original Markdown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Github-flavored Markdown</a></li>
<li><a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown Extra</a></li>
<li><a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These different flavors all serve their needs, but for Markdown to take off in the relatively small scholarly community it would be very helpful to come up with a reference implementation. But how do we get to that point?</p>
<ol>
<li>Think about the features we need for Scholarly Markdown and make this the reference implementation?</li>
<li>Organize a working group or committee that decides what is Scholarly Markdown?</li>
<li>Pick the Markdown flavor with the best developer support?</li>
<li>Figure out what markdown flavor has the widest support by tools relevant for scholars?</li>
<li>See what markdown flavor most scholars are currently using?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think as a starting point, and until we come up with something better, #5 makes the most sense. The number of markdown users among scholars is still small, but my guess would be that Pandoc is currently the most popular Markdown flavor among scholars. This blog uses Pandoc and the static site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> - for the source code use the link in the footer. Please tell me in the comments what you are using (Markdown flavor and tools), and whether I am correct with my wild guess regarding Pandoc. And make sure your preferred tool is listed in the <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring">Tools to support your markdown authoring</a> wiki page.</p>
<p>A reference Markdown document is also very helpful to move forward, as we can see what outputs in HTML, PDF (or other formats) our specific Markdown tools produce, and how they differ. This reference document should include citations, tables, figures, and other features typical for scholarly content. Ideally this is a paper written in Markdown and accepted for publication - proving the concept -, or it can be a published paper transformed into markdown, e.g. a paper by <a href="http://www.elifesciences.org/elife-now-supports-content-negotiation/">eLife</a>. Feel free to suggest a paper in the comments.</p>
<p>The idea of tests that came up in the Markdown workshop is also great. Ideally we have a set of tests that we (or someone else, e.g. a publisher) can run to make sure that the markdown in the document conforms with the reference implementation. This could also include basic checks for required metadata (title, author, publication date, etc.), and could optionally validate the citations as well.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the comments on <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">Monday’s blog post</a> about the Markdown for Science workshop, <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettiger</a> had some good arguments against the proposal for how to do <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/citations">citations</a> that we came up with during the workshop. As this is a complex topic, I decided to write this blog post.</p>
<p>Citations of the scholarly literature are an essential part of scholarly texts and therefore have to be supported by scholarly markdown. Both the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide">Multimarkdown</a> flavors of markdown support citations, using a bibtex file that contains citations, placeholders for citekeys – <code>[@smith04]</code> for Pandoc and <code>[#smith04]</code> for Multimarkdown – and the <a href="http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a> for citation formatting (Pandoc). A very reasonable approach would therefore be to use this functionality, with a preference for Pandoc because of the Citation Style Language support. All reference managers can export to the bibtex format, and some of them (e.g. <a href="http://www.papersapp.com/papers/">Papers</a>) make it very easy to copy and paste citekeys.</p>
<p>Ten days after the workshop I’m not so sure anymore this is the best approach. For four reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><strong>YFNS</strong></strong>. This approach failed the YFNS (your friendly neighborhood scientist) test. We came up with this term during the workshop and it means that our ideas about authoring should make sense to the workflow of the average scientist. I thought that using citekeys is a good idea, but my wife (my YFNS) tells me that she never uses citekeys because there are just too many <code>[@smith04]</code>, and it is too easy get out of sync with the reference manager. She therefore prefers to put the complete reference information into the text while writing.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Snippets</strong></strong>. As I said <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">previously</a>, I think that scholarly markdown has great potential not so much for writing full papers, but for all the little scientific documents we write on a daily basis. For this reason the citation information should ideally be embedded in the document if it is short, and that is difficult with bibtex (which is not human-readable).</li>
<li><strong><strong>Citations as links</strong></strong>. Carl Boettiger reminded me that I wrote a <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/citations-are-links-so-where-is-the-problem/">blog post in 2010</a> stating that citations are nothing else than links, and that we should treat them accordingly. He has written a tool (<a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</a>) for R that does just that, and Phil Lord and colleagues have written a similar tool (<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</a>) for Wordpress. In 2010 I wrote a tool for Wordpress (<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/link-to-link/">Link to Link</a>) that takes a different approach but also treats citations as links. All that we need is the DOI (or URL) for the article.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Vendor lock-in</strong></strong>. Although a number of excellent reference managers are available now, users are still limited in their choices because everyone has to use the same reference manager when multiple authors work on the same document. This has always annoyed me. It would no longer be the case if we embed the citation information in the document in a standard format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Part of the motivation for using scholarly markdown is that we can come up with best practices that make sense for digital content and don’t need to support conventions from an era when articles were still printed on paper. Reference information in the form of volumes and pages, and 1000s of citation styles certainly have outlived their purpose. Citation styles are a particular pain point, as they are nothing more than a visual representation of a citation - we should care much more about the machine-readable metadata, in particular the DOI or other identifier.</p>
<p>The best practice for scholarly markdown could therefore be to treat citations as links, using DOIs or other standard identifiers (PMID, ArXiV, etc.) where possible. Because we typically want to list the citations as references at the end of the document, reference-style links should be preferred over inline links. From the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">markdown syntax documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

This is [an example](http://example.com/ &quot;Title&quot;) inline link.
[id]: http://example.com/  &quot;Optional Title Here&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It might be tempting to use sequential numbers as id for the reference-style links, but the order of links can of course change during writing. It may make sense to think of the id in reference-style links as a citekey, and people should be free use that functionality of their reference manager. The citekey is used to link to the reference list at the bottom of the document, different from linking to the citekey in a separate bibtex file.</p>
<p>All of the above can be done in any text editor. This also includes the text editor that scholars spend most of their time with - their email program. Reference-style citations in an email are very readable, and also actionable since they are links and not text with bibliographic information.</p>
<p>One problem with this approach is of course that all links are inline in the resulting HTML, without a references section at the end of the document. This may be fine, as we can provide citation information in the title attribute, available upon hovering over the link (try hovering over <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">this link</a>, the journal eLife is doing <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00633">something similar</a>). The markdown could look like this (using the <em>Vancouver</em> citation style):</p>
<pre><code>[@Ioannidis2005]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 &quot;Ioannidis JPA. Why Most Published Research Findings Are False. PLoS Medicine. Public Library of Science; 2005;2(8):e124. Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The title attribute now of course uses a citation style, but this is optional information and can easily be reformatted as we have the DOI.</p>
<p>Or we break away from standard markdown and display reference-style links at the end of the document - similar to <a href="http://rephrase.net/box/word/footnotes/syntax/">footnotes</a>, which are also not part of standard markdown. But this is just a display issue that can be solved, and the solution might look different depending on whether the output is HTML, PDF or XML. This document for example contains 14 reference-style citations.</p>
<p>There is obviously a need for tools that make adding citations to scholarly markdown easier. This could be accomplished by relatively small changes to existing reference managers (enabling copy/paste of citations in reference-style markdown format), or by tools similar to the <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</a> mentioned above.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the important discussions taking place at the <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki">Markdown for Science</a> workshop last weekend was about the definition of Scholarly Markdown. We came up with <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">this</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Markdown that supports the requirements of scientific texts</li>
<li>Markdown as format that glues open scientific text resources together</li>
<li>A reference implementation with documentation and tests</li>
<li>A community</li>
</ol>
<p>We also agreed that <strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong> is a better term than <strong><strong>Markdown for Science</strong></strong>, as it also includes the Social Sciences and Humanities. And we agreed on a hashtag, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scholmd&amp;src=typd">#scholmd</a>.</p>
<p>I like #3 and #4, and I was not surprised to see #1. #2 is one of the most important outcomes of the workshop for me personally, and was reflected in the discussion we had in the breakout session on <em>What is needed for Markdown to be adopted by the scientific community?</em> One important strategy is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
We need an online tool that makes it easy for scholars to write scholarly markdown in a collaborative manner.
</blockquote>
<p>We called this the <strong><strong>Google Docs for Scientists</strong></strong> (Google Docs is a good collaborative tool, but is lacking some important features required for scientific documents, e.g. integrated citation management). <a href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</a> was mentioned as a promising example of this concept. It was also noted that some previous efforts failed, because the tool looked too different from Microsoft Word. But building such a tool wouldn’t really require markdown as a file format, and could for example also be done directly in HTML5. This would be a reasonable strategy, but in my mind is falling short because I think the problem we need to solve is more complicated than making collaboration easier with tools that look like Microsoft Word. We therefore also discussed a different strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
We need multiple tools that make it easy for scholars to create scholarly markdown documents and openly share them. This collaborative work is not limited to authoring scholarly papers, but also includes shorter scholarly texts, e.g. experimental results, lab notebooks, lecture notes, blog posts and working papers. Ease of use is not only defined by the writing experience, but also how easy it is to share documents with others.
</blockquote>
<p>This definition almost sounds like a definition for Open Science, and assumes that data - and increasingly software - are an integral part of reporting science. This makes <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/reproducibility">reproducibility</a> of scientific results much easier, and one nice example how this can be done is the integration of markdown into the R statistical software, using the <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr package</a>. Using the <a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/plos-alm-data/">May 2013 PLOS article-level metrics data</a> which are freely available for download, the R code below can be embedded into a markdown file and will produce the bar plot below when the markdown file is run in R (to try this yourself, download the ALM data and <a href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/plosOpenR/blob/master/barPlotSummary.Rmd">markdown file for this article</a>).</p>

<p>In a way this approach to scholarly markdown is much more difficult than building a nice online collaborative writing tool. But for me scholarly markdown is not about competing with Microsoft Word, it is about building something new that scholars want to use because it allows them to do something that is impossible with the existing tools. For the same reason my todo item at the end of the workshop was <em>think about document type where markdown shines</em>. The R example above is a great example where markdown shines. If you can think of additional examples, please add them to the comments.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the last <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner">Gobbledygook</a> post on PLOS Blogs, and at the same time the first post at the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/">new Github blog location</a>. I have been blogging at PLOS Blogs since the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/blogosphere/">PLOS Blogs Network</a> was launched in September 2010, so this step wasn’t easy. But I have two good reasons.</p>
<p>In May 2012 I started to work as technical lead for the <a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics</a> project. Although this is contract work, and I also do other things - including spending 5% of my time as clinical researcher at Hannover Medical School - this created the awkward situation that I was never quite sure whether I was blogging as Martin Fenner or as someone working for PLOS. This was all in my head, as I never had any restrictions in my blogging from PLOS. With the recent launch of the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/">PLOS Tech Blog</a> there is now a good venue for the kind of topics I like to write about, and I have started to work on two posts for this new blog.</p>
<p>There will always be topics for which the PLOS Tech Blog is not a good fit, and for these posts I have launched the new personal blog at Github. But the main reason for this new blog is a technical one: I’m moving away from blogging on Wordpress to writing my posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> (a lightweight markup language), that are then transformed into static HTML pages using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>. Last weekend I co-organized the workshop <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki"><strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong></a> together with <a href="http://twitter.com/houshuang">Stian Håklev</a>. A full workshop report will follow in another post, but the discussions before, at and after the workshop convinced me that <strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong> has a bright future and that it is time to move more of my writing to markdown. At the end of the workshop each participant suggested a <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki/Todo-list-from-workshop">todo item</a> that he/she would be working on, and my todo item was “Think about document type where MD shines”. Markdown might be good for writing scientific papers, but I think it really shines in shorter scientific documents that can easily be shared with others. And blog posts are a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The new site is work in progress. Over time I will copy over all old blog posts from PLOS Blogs, and will work on the layout as well as additional features. Special thanks to <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettiger</a> for helping me to get started with Jekyll and Github pages.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week re3data.org – the Registry of Research Data Repositories – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://www.re3data.org/2013/05/re3data-org-launched/">officially launched</a>. The registry is nicely described in a <a href="https://dx.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.21v1">preprint</a> also published this week.</p>
<p><em>re3data.org offers researchers, funding organizations, libraries and publishers and overview of the heterogeneous research data repository landscape. Information icons help researchers to identify an adequate repository for the storage and reuse of their data.</em></p>
<p>I really like re3data.org, and that is not because I personally know several of the people involved in this project, or because they <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/figshare-interview-with-mark-hahnel/">cited this blog</a> in their preprint. I think that we are just at the beginning of building the infrastructure needed for research data management, and re3data.org fills an important need. In my opinion it is not enough to provide lists of research data repositories, we need additional information that can help guide researchers in selecting an appropriate research data repository. re3data.org has addressed this nicely by providing a <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/re3data-org-registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched/10.2312/re3.002">vocabulary for the registration and description of research data repositories</a>, and by creating a simple icon system:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/figure2.png" class="kg-image" width="500" height="569" />

<p><em>Possible values for each icon. From <a href="https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.21v1">https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.21v1</a></em></p>
<p>Future directions I would like re3data.org to take include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training and education.</strong> Researchers probably pick research data repositories mainly based on the familiarity of the repository within their community rather than the criteria developed by re3data.org. A lot more training and education is needed before researchers understand the importance of persistent identifiers, licenses and other criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Integration.</strong> re3data.org can make it easier to integrate into existing scientific infrastructure, e.g. by using persistent identifiers such as DOIs for research data repositories, or by providing an API that makes it easier for other services to integrate re3data.org.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong>. Whether or not scientific infrastructure such as re3data.org is accepted and used by the community depends on many factors, and governance is one of the most important ones. re3data.org should seek the support of other organizations, in particular from outside Germany. A governing board, re3data.org as an independent organization, and strategies to coordinate with similar efforts such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://www.databib.org/">Databib</a> are possible strategies.</li>

<p>This Thursday I take part in a panel discussion at the <a href="http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013">Joint ORCID – Dryad Symposium on Research Attribution</a>. Together with <a href="http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/editorial-staff/trish-groves">Trish Groves</a> (BMJ) and <a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/cborgman/Chriss_Site/Welcome.html">Christine Borgman</a> (UCLA) I will discuss several aspects of attribution. Trish will speak about ethics, Christine will highlight problems, and I will add my perspective on metrics. This blog post summarizes the main points I want to make.</p>
<p>Scholarly metrics can be used in discovery tools, as business intelligence for funders, research organizations or publishers, and for research assessment. For all these scenarios – and in particular for research assessment – it is important to not only collect metrics for a particular journal publication, dataset or other research output, but to also link these metrics to the creators of that research output.  That is why unique identifiers for researchers, and ORCID in particular, are so important for scholarly metrics, and this is also reflected in the ORCID membership of organizations such as Thomson Reuters, Elsevier/Scopus, Altmetric or F1000Prime who provide metrics in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>A good starting point for any discussion on metrics for research assessment is the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (<a href="https://sfdora.org">DORA</a>) that was published las week, together with a set of editorials in several journals, including the <em><a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/early/2013/05/14/jcb.201304162.full">Journal of Cell Biology</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/24/10/1505.full">Molecular Biology of the Cell</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/emboj/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/emboj2013126a.html">EMBO Journal</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/787">Science</a></em>, <em><a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/early/2013/05/09/jcs.134460.full.pdf+html">Journal of Cell Science</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/elife/2/e00855.full.pdf">eLife</a></em>. The first three recommendations are a good starting point for the panel discussion:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Do not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions.</em></li>
<li><em>Be explicit about the criteria used in evaluating the scientific productivity of grant applicants and clearly highlight, especially for early-stage investigators, that the scientific content of a paper is much more important than publication metrics or the identity of the journal in which it was published.</em></li>
<li><em>For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="persistent-identifiers">Persistent Identifiers</h2>
<p>Before we can collect any metrics, we need persistent identifiers for research outputs. Most journal articles now come with a DOI, but we should make it easier for smaller publishers to use DOIs, as cost unfortunately is still an issue.</p>
<p>Persistent identifiers for data are a much more complex issue, as there a number of persistent identifiers out there (including DOIs, handles, ARKs and purls), in addition to all the domain-specific identifiers, e.g. for nucleotide sequence or protein structures. DataCite DOIs are probably the first choice for attribution, as this is their main use case and they have features that make attribution easier (e.g. familiar to researchers, funders and publishers, global resolver). There are many other use cases for identifiers for data (e.g. to identify temporary datasets in an ongoing experiment), and is of course possible to use several identifiers for the same dataset. CrossRef is of course also issuing DOIs for datasets on behalf of their members, and the publisher PLOS is for example using CrossRef <a href="https://front-matter.io/mfenner/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">component DOIs</a> for figures and supplementary information associated with a journal article, and is <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2013/01/easier-access-to-plos-data/">making them available via figshare</a>.</p>
<p>Particular challenges with persistent identifiers for research data include different versions of a dataset, and aggregation of datasets (e.g. whether we want to cite the aggregate dataset, or a particular subset). Persistent identifiers for other research outputs are an even bigger challenge, e.g. how to uniquely identify scientific software.</p>
<p>In addition to persistent identifiers for research outputs, we also need persistent identifiers for researchers. ORCID is obviously a good candidate, as it focusses on attribution (by allowing researchers to claim their research outputs and by integration in many researcher workflows). But it is clear that ORCID is not the only persistent identifiers for researchers, and that we need to link these identifiers, e.g. <a href="https://orcid.org/blog/2013/04/22/orcid-and-isni-issue-joint-statement-interoperation-april-2013">ORCID and ISNI</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on how we want to aggregate the metrics we are interested in, we might also need persistent identifiers for institutions, for funding agencies and their grant IDs, and for resources such as particle accelerators or research vessels. Unfortunately much more work is needed in these areas.</p>
<h2 id="attribution">Attribution</h2>
<p>Attribution is then the next step, linking persistent identifiers for research outputs to their creators. Attribution is therefore essential for research assessment. The <a href="https://www.force11.org/AmsterdamManifesto">Amsterdam Manifesto on Data Citation Principles</a> that came out of the Beyond the PDF 2 workshop in March are an excellent document, but are unfortunately missing the important step of linking persistent identifiers for data to the persistent identifiers of their creators.</p>
<p>One important issue related to attribution is the provenance of the claims. Has a researcher claimed authorship for a particular paper, is a data center linking creators to research data, or is a funder doing this? The ORCID registry is built around the concept of self-claims by authors, but will allow the other stakeholders to confirm these claims.</p>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Metrics for scholarly content fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citations</li>
<li>Usage stats</li>
<li>Altmetrics</li>
</ul>
<p>Altmetrics is a mixed bag of many different things, from sharing on social media such as Twitter or Facebook to more scholarly activities such as Mendeley bookmarks or F1000Prime reviews. I therefore expect the altmetrics category to over time further evolve into 2-3 sub-categories.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with citation-based metrics for journal articles. We currently see the long-overdue shift from journal-based citation metrics to article-level metrics (see #1 from the DORA statement above for the reasoning), and as the technical lead for the PLOS Article-Level Metrics project I of course welcome this shift in focus. We also see a trend towards opening up reference lists that will make citation-based metrics much more accessible, and the <a href="http://opencitations.net/">JISC Open Citations</a> project by David Shotton and others is an important driver in this, as is the <a href="http://openbiblio.net/">Open Bibliographic Data</a> project by OKFN. Until open bibliographic data become the norm, we have to deal with different citation counts from different sources. PLOS is collecting citations from Web of Science, Scopus, CrossRef and PubMed Central, and the citation counts are highly correlated overall (e.g. R2= 0.87 for CrossRef and Scopus citations for 2009 PLOS Biology papers), but for some papers differ substantially. Similar to persistent identifiers, reference lists of publications should become part of the open e-infrastructure for science and not depend on proprietary systems. This makes citation metrics more transparent and easier to compare, and fosters research and innovation, in particular by smaller organizations.</p>
<p>The data citation community has adopted the journal article citation model, and we are starting to see more citations to datasets. Even though data citations look similar to citations of journal articles, many essential tools and services still don’t properly handle datasets. The <a href="http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/">Web of Knowledge Data Citation Index</a> is an important step in the right direction, as is the <a href="http://odin-project.eu/2013/05/13/new-orcid-integrated-data-citation-tool/">new DataCite import tool for ORCID</a>. Something that we should pay closer attention to is the citation counts of the paper(s) associated with a dataset. Maybe the major scientific impact is in the data, but scientific practice still dictates to the cite the corresponding paper and not the dataset itself (one of the reasons we see data journals being launched). The DataCite metadata can contain the persistent identifier of the corresponding journal article, thus making it possible to associate the citation count of the corresponding paper with the dataset. This approach is particularly important for datasets that are always part of a paper, as is the case for Dryad. One important consideration is that contributor lists may differ between journal article and dataset, or between related datasets.</p>
<p>Another problem with data citation is that citation counts might not be the best way to reflect the scientific impact of a dataset. We are increasingly seeing usage stats for datasets, and DataCite for example has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.datacite.org/node/76">started in January</a> to publish monthly stats for the most popular datasets by number of DOI resolutions. The #1 dataset in March was the raw data to a figure in a F1000Research article, <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Figure_7_raw_data_Effect_of_variable_exposure_to_PTHrP_1_36_on_bone_nodules_and_AP_activity_in_high_plating_density_cultures_/154685">hosted on figshare</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to citations we see a strong trend for usage stats to move from aggregate numbers for journals to article-level metrics. COUNTER has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.projectcounter.org/pirus.html">released</a> a draft code of practice for their PIRUS (Publisher and Institutional Repository Usage Statistics) standard in February, and increasing numbers of publishers and repository infrastructure providers such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.irus.mimas.ac.uk/">IRUS-UK</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english">OA-Statistics</a> are providing usage stats for individual articles.</p>
<p>One challenge with usage stats, in particular with Open Access content, is that an article or other research output might be available in more than one place, e.g. publisher (or data center), disciplinary repository and institutional repository. For PLOS articles we don’t know the aggregated usage stats from institutional repositories, but we know that 17% of HTML pageviews and 33% of PDF downloads happen not at the PLOS website, but at PubMed Central.</p>
<p>Altmetrics provide new challenges, but they are also a more recent development compared to usage stats and citations. Similar to usage stats they are easier to game than citations, and for some altmetrics sources (e.g. Twitter) standardization is still difficult. Altmetrics not necessarily measure impact, but sometimes rather reflect attention or self-promotion. We have just started to look into altmetrics beyond the numbers, e.g. who is tweeting, bookmarking or discussing a paper or dataset. Altmetrics provide the opportunity to show the broader social impact (as Mike Taylor from Elsevier explains it) of research, e.g. changing clinical practice or policies.</p>
<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<p>One important aspect to attribution is contribution, i.e. what is the specific contribution by a researcher to a paper or other research output. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102820/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/attribution_workshop">International Workshop on Contributorship and Scholarly Attribution</a> was held together with the May 2012 ORCID Outreach Meeting to discuss this topic. Authorship position (e.g. first author, last author) is used in some metrics, but overall the contributor role is still poorly appreciated in most metrics. David Shotton has proposed a <a href="http://purl.org/spar/scoro/Shotton_SCoRO_and_SCoRF_Contributions-Workshop_Harvard_16May2012.pdf">Scholarly Contributions and Roles Ontology</a> (ScoRO), and is suggesting to split authorship credit in percentage points based on relative contributions, but I haven’t seen these numbers used in the context of metrics.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Persistent identifiers for people, attribution and metrics are closely interrelated and we have seen a lot of exciting developments in this area in the last two years. The widespread adoption of ORCID identifiers by the research community will have a huge impact on scholarly metrics. But with all the excitement we should never forget that a) there will never be a single metric that can be used for research assessment, and b) that scientific content will always be more important than any metric. I look forward to a great panel discussions on Thursday, and welcome any feedback via comments, Twitter or email.</p>

<p>There are many things I like about this new DataCite/ORCID integration tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes it easier for researchers to get credit for their research outputs.</li>
<li>it shows the value of persistent identifiers for data, publications and people, and linking them together</li>
<li>it shows the Creative Commons licenses for DataCite content where this info is available, facilitating reuse of content</li>
<li>it demonstrates the power of open source (thanks CrossRef!), open collaboration, standard REST APIs, and lightweight programming (Sinatra/Ruby) and deployment (Vagrant, Amazon EC2, Rackspace) tools</li>
<li>it shows that we don’t need a single – often closed – system, but open services that build on top of each other using accepted community standards. Tools using the ORCID API can immediately reuse the new DataCite content, altmetrics provided by <a href="https://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> are a good example</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to explore some of these ideas in the panel <strong>Attribution: Managing Provenance, Ethics, and Metrics</strong> at the combined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013">ORCID/Dryad Meeting</a> in Oxford next Thursday.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday June 8th – exactly a month from today – the PLOS San Francisco offices will host a workshop/hackathon about using markdown for science. A lot of people are experimenting with markdown for authoring scientific articles – see blog posts <a href="http://blog.yoavram.com/markx/">here</a>, <a href="http://inundata.org/2012/06/01/markdown-and-the-future-of-collaborative-manuscript-writing/">here</a> or my post <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">here</a>, and the scientific manuscript <a href="https://github.com/weecology/data-sharing-paper/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Markdown is a simple markup language for text, and is primarily used for HTML content on the web, but can also be converted to PDF, LaTeX and others. One challenge with markdown is that there are a number of slightly different “flavors” out there, from the original markdown to multimarkdown, github-flavored markdown and pandoc. Some of the advanced formatting of scientific documents – tables, citations, math – is still a challenge for markdown.</p>
<p>Will markdown become our next authoring format for scientific content? Will there be yet another flavor, scholarly markdown? How will markdown writing tools be different from LaTeX tools or Microsoft Word? If you care about any of these questions and are in or near San Francisco, join us on for all full day on June 8th. Free registration is open at <a href="http://mdsci13.eventbrite.com/">http://mdsci13.eventbrite.com</a>. We are collecting workshop ideas at <a href="https://github.com/karthikram/markdown_science/wiki/workshop">https://github.com/karthikram/markdown_science/wiki/workshop</a>, the Twitter hashtag is #mdsci13.</p>
<p>This event is organized by <a href="http://twitter.com/houshuang">Stian Håklev</a> and myself, with generous support by a <a href="http://www.force11.org/node/4358">1K Challenge prize from Force11</a>, and hosting provided by PLOS.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102027/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article-Level Metrics</a> provide new ways to look at the impact of scholarly research. Two important concepts are a) to track metrics for individual scholarly articles instead of using numbers aggregated by journal, and b) to go beyond citations and also include usage stats and altmetrics.</p>
<p>Article-Level Metrics is also doing something else: instead of tracking impact by year, it looks at usage, altmetrics and citations in real-time. There might have been technical reasons to do so 20 years ago, but there really is no longer any reason why scholarly impact should be tracked on a yearly basis in 2013. Unfortunately there is one big stumbling block:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>The publication date of a scholarly article is often difficult or impossible to obtain. Publication year may be the only available information.</em></em>
</blockquote>
<p>A good example is CrossRef. They provide a lot of interesting metadata about an article and make this information available in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102027/http://search.crossref.org/">a very nice search interface</a>. But they only require the publisher to provide the publication year, information about the publication month and day is optional. There are many other examples of journals and services that just can’t tell you when exactly an article was published. This might have made sense when periodicals were printed on paper, but doesn’t work for digital content.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cameron Neylon yesterday wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://cameronneylon.net/blog/whats-the-right-model-for-shared-scholarly-communications-infrastructure/">great blog post</a> about appropriate business models for shared scholarly communications infrastructure. This is an area I have also been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2013/03/20/the-price-of-innovation-my-thoughts-for-beyond-the-pdf/">thinking about a lot recently</a>, and in this post I want to add a technical perspective (and an announcement) to the discussion.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> is an important trend that brings software development and administration of IT infrastructure closer together. Agile software development, server virtualization, cloud infrastructure and software automation tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://cfengine.com/">CFEngine</a> are an important pars of DevOps, but it is really the collaborative aspect of IT administrators working much closer with software developers what defines DevOps. The end result is often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://readwrite.com/2013/03/27/devops-booms-in-the-enterprise">faster and more stable software releases</a>, and that is what is users and customers care about.</p>
<p>This makes DevOps particularly relevant for all areas where innovation is important, and that of course includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://science.okfn.org/tools-for-open-science/">tools and services for Open Science</a>. We not only need infrastructure that facilitates software development (with services like Github, among many others), but we also have to streamline IT administration. The question is not whether you do your development in Java, Python, Ruby, PHP or Javascript, but how well you integrate your software development and IT administration. The shift towards web-based tools has centralized software installation and updates, but these web-based services are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to set up and administer. Running an institutional respository, research information system or a journal is a complex task. The software may be freely available as open source (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.dspace.org/">Dspace</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://vivoweb.org/">VIVO</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs">Open Journal Systems</a>), but the resources required to run such a service still make this a big investment.</p>
<p>Two solutions to this dilemma are to pay either a vendor for installation and maintenance, or to use the software as a service (SaaS) that is hosted somewhere else. Why these two options are popular, they may not always be the best choices because they mean that you are locked in to a particular vendor or service provider, and that you may give expertise and direct access to your data away. I believe that these are helpful approaches for auxillary services, but that ideally the core services of a library, publisher or other provider of scientific infrastructure should not be outsourced. Developing software for scientific infrastructure that you want organizations to install locally should therefore always include work on integration with IT infrastructure, and just providing manual installation instructions isn’t good enough anymore.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/article-level-metrics/">Article-Level Metrics</a> (ALM) and the related altmetrics are becoming increasingly popular. The collection and display of this information is a complex process, as it requires the integration of information from several upstream APIs which may be temporarily unavailable, have changed their data format, or put up restrictions on how you can use the data. In turn this information has to be processed and aggregated, and then reliably be provided to downstream users. This kind of information gathering fits perfectly with a service provider model, and organizations such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.altmetric.com/">Altmetric</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.plumanalytics.com/">Plum Analytics</a>. PLOS is collecting and displaying this information with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">its own tool</a>. The simple reason is that PLOS started doing this several years before the services above became available, and none of them currently provide the same comprehensive set of information about citations, usage stats and altmetrics (although there are of course a lot of things they do better than the PLOS ALM application).</p>
<p>But there is also the question of whether Article-Level Metrics are a core service for every publisher and are best collected in-house. This not only makes it easier to collect information from some sources (e.g. usage stats or CrossRef citations), but also gives unrestricted access to the data in real-time. When I took over as technical lead for the PLOS Article-Level Metrics project last May, I therefore not only worked on improving the ALM application for PLOS, but we are also working hard on making it easier for other publishers to install and use the application. We want to provide an attractive alternative for organizations for which the service provider model is not the best option.</p>
<p>To that end I want to announce the latest feature which allows the automated installation of the PLOS ALM application on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance. This option is great not only for setting up an ALM production service, but because of the EC2 pricing model by hour (about $1 a day for a small EC2 instance) without setup costs is a great way to test-drive the application for a publisher, to analyze a particular set of papers from different publishers for a research project, or to set up a PLOS ALM server for a hackathon or workshop.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are of course many options to automate software deployment on a production server, including the PaaS (platform as a service) providers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.cloudfoundry.com/">CloudFoundry</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>, and the recently announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://aws.amazon.com/de/opsworks/">Amazon OpsWorks</a>. I am a big fan of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> software development tool in combination with Chef for automation, and in March Vagrant added <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html">support for Amazon AWS</a>. This makes deployment of the PLOS ALM application to AWS really simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Vagrant and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws">vagrant-aws plugin</a></li>
<li>Setup an Amazon Web Services Account</li>
<li>Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">PLOS ALM source code</a> from Github</li>
<li>run the command <strong>vagrant up –provider aws</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Step #4 took 898 sec or about 15 min on my computer (see screenshot), and at the end I had a PLOS ALM server where I could access the admin dashboard via the web interface. If you are familiar with Amazon Web Services – you have to think about  the right size for the EC2 instance, an appropriate AMI, security groups, elastic IPs, and DNS service – then the whole process should be done in well under an hour. I will use this instance to load and analyze some articles from a publisher for a presentation next week. When I’m done, another command (<strong>vagrant destroy</strong>) will destroy this server and Amazon will stop billing me. During testing I have created and destroyed many servers, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102958/http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/preview-vagrant-aws.html">vagrant-aws video</a> shows you how easy this process is.</p>
<p>At this stage the installation process is working (and has been working for a local Virtualbox install for many months), but needs testing and documentation. I therefore invite everyone interested in testing this out to contact me so that we can make this well-documented and working reliably.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week the rumors that started in January became official: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/start-up-life/team-mendeley-is-joining-elsevier/">Elsevier is buying Mendeley</a> (see also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://elsevierconnect.com/elsevier-welcomes-mendeley/">here</a>). A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://enjoythedisruption.com/post/47527556151/my-thoughts-on-mendeley-elsevier-why-i-left-to-start">lot has been written</a> about this announcement, in particular about the fear that Mendeley as a product and organization will turn into something not as open and collaborative as before.</p>
<p>I first met Victor and Jan from Mendeley in 2008 and did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/09/05/interview_with_victor_henning_from_mendeley/">interview with Victor</a> in September 2008. We worked together in the organization of two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London conferences</a> (2009 and 2010, together with Nature.com and others), and my current job started with an entry for an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/">API programming contest</a> co-organized by PLOS and Mendeley, with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/">first lines of code written</a> in the Mendeley offices during the Science Online London 2011 hackathon. I wish Mendeley all the best with their new parent.</p>
<p>What this acquisition signals to me is that commercial publishers are now moving into the software tools for scientists business at full speed. They have always done this, but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.readcube.com/">ReadCube</a> by Digital Science (a Nature Publishing Group sister company) in 2011, the acquisition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.papersapp.com/">Papers</a> by Springer last year and now Mendeley, reference management now often means using a tool owned by a publisher – this market used to be dominated academic software such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and commercial software vendors such as Thomson Reuters (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://endnote.com/">Endnote</a>) or ProQuest (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a>).</p>
<p>For me this trend signals that publishers have realized that we are moving into an Open Access publishing model, which in contrast to subscription publishing is not about owning the content, but about providing valuable services around content that is free to read and reuse.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week Philippe Desjardins-Prouly et al. published the article <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.655710">The case for open preprints in biology</a> – naturally as a preprint on figshare. The article sees preprint servers as a great opportunity for open science, and discusses the status of preprints in the biological sciences. In this blog post I want to add some comments to the text.</p>
<h2 id="e-biomed">E-BIOMED</h2>
<p>What is now PubMed Central <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.nih.gov/about/director/pubmedcentral/ebiomedarch.htm">started out as E-BIOMED in 1999</a> and initially was envisioned to include a repository for preprints. It is important to look back at what happened then, and why the preprint repository was dropped from what then became PubMed Central. Harold Varmus talks a bit about this in this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://poynder.blogspot.de/2006/06/interview-with-harold-varmus.html">interview</a> from 2006.</p>
<h2 id="nature-precedings">Nature Precedings</h2>
<p>The article talks about why biologists have not developed a culture of sharing preprints. It would be good to mention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>, a preprint server for the life sciences started in 2007 that stopped taking new submissions in 2012. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/nature-precedings-to-stop-accepting-submissions-next-week-after-finding-model-unsustainable/">This blog post</a> on RetractionWatch cites the announcement by Nature Publishing Group (which doesn’t explain why the service was shut down), and there are a good number of interesting comments.</p>
<h2 id="ssrn">SSRN</h2>
<p>Preprints in other disciplines are mentioned in the text, in particular ArXiv, but also RePEc. I would also include <strong>SSRN</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.ssrn.com/">Social Science Research Network</a>), which uses a different model, but is as important for the working paper and preprint culture in the social sciences as ArXiV is in physics/mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="google-scholar-metrics">Google Scholar Metrics</h2>
<p>In April 2012 Google launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=en">Google Scholar Metrics</a>, listing the top 100 publications (according to their h5-index) in several disciplines. Six out of the top 10 publications in physics/mathematics are ArXiV sections (arXiv Astrophysics (astro-ph) is #2), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers">IZA Discussion Papers</a> are #1 in Social Sciences, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://www.nber.org/papers.html">NBER Working Papers</a> are #1 in Economics, and arXiv Astrophysics (astro-ph) is #12 on the top 100 list for all disciplines (#1-5 are journals in biology and medicine: <em>Nature</em>, <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>Lancet</em>, <em>Cell</em>). All these metrics are a strong indicator that preprints can be highly cited.</p>
<h2 id="citation-advantage-of-preprints">Citation Advantage of Preprints</h2>
<p>Anne Gentil-Beccot et al. have written a nice paper (of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418">available as preprint</a>) that shows that publication as preprint now only increases the citation rate for the corresponding peer-reviewed article published later, but also leads to much faster citations, with a peak immediately after publication.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="scoap3">SCOAP3</h2>
<p>The Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publications in High Energy Physics (<a href="https://scoap3.org/">SCOAP3</a>) is working on turning the majority of peer-reviewed publications in high energy physics into gold open access. It is important to understand that the high energy physics community feels that they need peer-reviewed journal articles in addition to ArXiv.</p>
<h2 id="preprint-culture-in-clinical-medicine">Preprint Culture in Clinical Medicine</h2>
<p>It is a little known fact that there is a strong preprint culture in clinical medicine. I have written about this topic in <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">October 2010</a>. Clinical trials have to be registered before starting the trial, and information about the trial is publicly available in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</a> and other registries. Results are presented in conferences (as poster or oral presentation), at which stage it becomes public information. The peer-reviewed paper – with a few exceptions – follows much later, sometimes even after drug approval by the FDA (in the blog post I used the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61389-X">TROPIC</a> trial as example). The problem is of course that information in oral presentations and posters is incomplete and difficult to find. But publication of a clinical trial in a peer-reviewed journal is more about giving credit to the researchers involved (similar to SCOAP3 in high energy physics) than about spreading the knowledge. Peer review is not an appropriate filter for whether or not a new drug or drug combination should be used to treat patients – the approval process by regulatory authorities is much more extensive than any peer review can ever be.</p>
<h2 id="preprint-culture-in-biology">Preprint culture in Biology</h2>
<p>The paper mentions several reasons why the field of biology has essentially no preprint culture. One argument against preprints is that it would be easier to steal ideas. Although I agree with the authors that preprints are a great way to establish precedence, there is a big difference between research based on years of work using expensive equipment (as is often the case in high energy physics but also some other fields), and research that can be reproduced in a few weeks. In the latter case it is possible that someone else is faster in publishing the peer-reviewed paper. Another difference is the community: “stealing” ideas from someone else is probably more difficult in smaller scientific communities, and some scientific communities are more competitive and less collaborative than others.</p>
<p>Another concern about preprints raised in the paper is the Ingelfinger rule, i.e. the uncertainty that a journal would accept a manuscript if already published as a preprint. This concern is fortunately unfounded regarding most publishers, and the paper includes a table listing the preprint policies of important publishers in biology.</p>
<p>I would like to add two other reasons why the preprint culture is probably not established in biology. Preprints are competition for the peer-reviewed journal article and scholarly publishers might not be particularly interested in encouraging a preprint culture. A lot has fortunately changed since E-BIOMED in 1999.</p>
<p>Finally, whereas some disciplines use preprints and working papers to communicate, in biology the preferred way to communicate research findings before publication of a peer-reviewed paper is the oral presentation. What we may need is a service that makes it easy to upload and share scientific presentations. We for example already have Slideshare, Speaker Deck as generic tools, and SciVee, figshare aimed at scientists. Speaker Deck <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/speaker-deck-for-sharing-presentations/">is currently my favorite tool</a> and is a Github product (Github has been mentioned in the manuscript as an option for hosting preprints). Maybe what is missing is a killer combination of features in a new or existing service – persistent identifiers, uploading of background material (text, data, software, video) in addition to the slides, non-textual search, cooperation with conference organizers, etc. – for presentation sharing to take off as a way to establish a preprint culture in biology.</p>

Read <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/04/03/who-killed-the-preprint-and-could-it-make-a-return/">this blog post</a> for details, and this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731034700/http://blog.mendeley.com/open-access/is-the-time-right-for-a-preprint-server-for-life-science/">post</a> on the Mendeley blog.</em></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PLOS Article-Level Metrics (ALM) are a great set of data (available via API and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/plos-alm-data/">monthly data dump</a>) for some nice data visualizations. I have recently become a big fan of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> javascript library, and have now used d3 to look at some ALM data over time.</p>
<p>I like simple visualizations without too many labels or axes, and wanted to do a visualization inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">sparklines</a> ever since we discussed this idea in our <em>altviz</em> breakout group at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/alm-workshop-2012/hackathon/#altviz">ALM workshop hackathon</a> in November 2012 (kudos in particular to Juan Alperin, Karthik Ram and Carl Boettiger). In the chart below every column represents the numbers for a given month, with alternating colors for the years (the article was published November 2009).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sparklines4-e1364338936408.png" class="kg-image" width="300" height="263" alt="CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article Article-Level Metrics and the Evolution of Scientific Impact by month, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000242." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article <strong>Article-Level Metrics and the Evolution of Scientific Impact</strong> by month, available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000242">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000242</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can see a pattern that is probably typical for many articles independent of the absolute numbers: most pageviews and downloads happen in the weeks after publication, as does academic bookmarking and science blogging.</p>
<p>The second example shows a very different pattern. This is not only the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://alm.plos.org/sources/counter">most-downloaded</a> PLOS article, but  the distribution of downloads over time is very different, with the number of monthly downloads actually higher the last two years (this article was published in August 2005). We also see a few spikes in the usage stats, probably indicating events that triggered usage. Academic bookmarking was most active from 2009 to 2011 and not right after publication, although that might also have to do with the relative popularity of CiteULike over time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sparklines5-500x262.png" class="kg-image" width="500" height="262" alt="CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article Why Most Published Research Findings Are False by month, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article <strong>Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</strong> by month, available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Citation data are unfortunately more difficult to get with exact publication dates (why is that so difficult?), but we can at least look at CrossRef numbers by year for the same article.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sparklines31-e1364340861413.png" class="kg-image" width="200" height="169" alt="CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article Why Most Published Research Findings Are False by year, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">CiteULike bookmarks, usage stats from PLOS website and blog posts for article <strong>Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</strong> by year, available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The citation numbers by year are still increasing (the last bar is for 2013), indicating that this article is still of general interest 8 years after publication. This would probably be unusual for a life sciences research article, but the article is an essay looking at common pitfalls in the statistical analysis of research data.</p>

<p>How to pay for the development of new scientific infrastructure and tools is something that I think a lot about science moving away from academia to become a developer of scientific software last year. I would assume three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are a lot of great ideas out there to improve scholarly communication</li>
<li>there is enough money out there to pay for improvements in scholarly communication</li>
<li>we are frustrated because progress is much slower than we anticipate</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have enough great ideas and enough money, but don’t see the results we expect, something must be going wrong. A simple answer would be that it is different people and organizations that have the ideas from those that have the money, but I don’t think that this is the reason. My suspicion is that there is a deeper problem, and that the approach we take to scholarly innovation is broken. Below is how innovation is approached by the major players:</p>
<ul>
<li>individual scientists and/or software developers come up with great ideas, but don’t get past the prototype stage because of limited resources</li>
<li>academic tools and infrastructure are built as part of a funded project (anywhere from 6 months to a few years), but there are no resources to turn this into a service that is persistent beyond the project</li>
<li>publishers and large academic institutions have the resources to build these tools. They are often less innovative because of their size</li>
<li>funders pay for projects (see above), but rarely for infrastructure, and they rarely get involved in innovative projects themselves</li>
<li>commercial organizations can quickly bring great ideas to market (in particular small startups), but it is often unclear how their services are paid for in the long run</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day it seems that we have a lot of great ideas, but many of them never reach critical mass, and an even smaller number has long-term sustainability. I can think of a number of great projects that have never gained traction, and of a number of great tools and services where I have no idea how their development and service is paid for. The idea to get to a large number of users no matter what it costs, and figure out the business plan later is popular with internet startups, but dangerous when we care about tools we want to still use two years from now. Two projects that are not specific to science, but are important for science and have made this work are <strong>Wikipedia</strong> and <strong>Github</strong>. From the long list of tools for scientists I would not pick <strong>Mendeley</strong> or <strong>figshare</strong> (both great services, but still in search of sustainability), but <strong>ArXiV</strong> and <strong>Papers</strong>.It also doesn’t help that most scientists are a conservative bunch when it comes to technology, and that the scientific market is fairly small compared to the overall number of users. Another big challenge is to innovate in an open environment, i.e. to make the innovation available to as many people as possible without barriers of access. Some of my personal conclusions from all this are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>we should acknowledge that we have an innovation problem, and it is not simply solved by getting more money</li>
<li>we have a collaboration problem, too many people are doing similar things without talking to each other and working together</li>
<li>scientific infrastructure and tools cost money. We need the right people to pay (ideally not the individual researcher), fair prices and intelligent business models</li>
<li>funders should reconsider how they pay for scientific infrastructure, as the project-based approach is broken</li>
<li>large organizations (commercial, non-commercial and academic) should think about their approach to innovation, in particular how they support innovation outside of their organization</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the journal <em>Nature</em> has released a special on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155331/http://www.nature.com/news/specials/scipublishing/index.html">Future of Publishing</a>. It includes a lot of interesting reading, but I want to focus on the comment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155331/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/495437a">Beyond the Paper</a> by Jason Priem. In the comment Jason describes his vision of the future of scholarly communication, a future where many of today’s roles for articles and journals will be replaced by the <em>decoupled journal</em> and online tools taking the lead in dissemination and filtering of scholarly content.</p>
<p>Jason makes a strong case for this vision, and takes his time to also discuss the concerns and challenges. He doesn’t have the space to discuss in more detail how we get to that future, and in particular what the role of researchers, publishers, libraries and funders be in that transition.</p>
<p>Jason’s vision will probably be overwhelming for many researchers, and might not directly address what is probably the biggest issue for most researchers: funding for grants and jobs is limited, and the processes we use to select for good science and good scientists are inefficient and often arbitrary. Most students entering graduate school will not be able to have a career in academia, and most academics will say that they spend far too much time with evaluations – of their own work and the work of others. It is unclear to me how we can get from the current system – where one misstep such as denied grant or submission to the wrong journal can mean the end of a career – to the system that Jason envisions. The current climate doesn’t really foster experimentation by researchers and I am interested to understand how researchers can take part in this process of change.</p>
<p>The vision of the decoupled journal is very threatening for some of the stakeholders of the current scholarly communication ecosystem, in particular publishers and libraries. Every journal publisher and library knows that it has to reinvent itself to survive the digital transformation, but a vision that is build around a new ecosystem of service providers needs to be clear how publishers and libraries can be part of the transformation process.</p>
<p>Lastly, I disagree with the notion that <em>today’s publication silos will be replaced by a set of decentralized, interoperable services that are built on a core infrastructure of open data and evolving standards — like the Web itself.</em> I would argue that both scholarly communication and the web in general have a tendency for centralization, and that scientific infrastructure needs to be interoperable first and decentralized second. Without a focus on interoperability the future of scholarly communication will not be open and in the hands of many, but will be a race to become one of the dominant players in this new ecosystem, and we might end up with not 1000s of libraries and publishers but just a handful of technology companies holding the keys to our scientific infrastructure.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Google announced that they will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://googleblog.blogspot.de/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">shut down Google Reader</a> July 1st. In a way this announcement didn’t surprise me, as my own use of RSS readers has gone down in favor of news readers such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/05/flipboard-plos-blogs-on-the-ipad/">Flipboard</a> and using Twitter as a discovery tool. And built-in support for RSS had slowly been depreciated in web browsers such as Firefox (version 4, 2011) and Safari (version 6, 2012).</p>
<p>Although RSS (and the related Atom) may never have caught on with the typical web user, it is an essential tool for scholarly content. It is the best format to subscribe to journal table of contents, much more suitable than email alerts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/">JournalTOCs</a> is a good place to get started, but most publishers prominently display the RSS icon. RSS is also great for searches you want to do regularly and is supported by PLOS, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/040_060.html">PubMed</a>, and others. Because it is a machine-readable format, it is also used by many websites to automatically read in article information. RSS feeds for journal table of contents differ in format, but CrossRef in 2009 has posted <a href="https://oxford.crossref.org/best_practice/rss/">recommendations</a> for publishers.</p>
<p>Google Reader is of course only one of many RSS readers, so this announcement shouldn’t have any immediate impact. Nevertheless it is probably another sign that the web is moving away from RSS, and that we should start to think about alternatives for distributing tables of content. Or that we should use different strategies for finding interesting articles that have recently been published, e.g. follow the article recommendations in your social network.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following up from <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">my post last week</a>, below is a suggested list of features that should be supported in documents written in scholarly markdown. Please provide feedback via the comments, or by editing the Wiki version I have set up <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/scholarly-markdown/wiki">here</a>. Listed are features that go beyond the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">standard markdown syntax</a>.</p>
<p>The goals of scholarly markdown are</p>
<ol>
<li>to support writing of complete scholarly articles,</li>
<li>don’t make the syntax more complicated than it is today, and</li>
<li>don’t rely on HTML as the fallback mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice this means that scholarly markdown should support most, but not all scholarly texts – documents that are heavy in math formulas, have complicated tables, etc. may be better written with LaTeX or Microsoft Word. It also means that scholarly markdown will probably contain only limited semantic markup, as this is difficult to do with a lightweight markup language and much easier with XML or a binary file format.</p>
<h2 id="cover-page">Cover Page</h2>
<p>Optional metadata about a document. Typically used for title, authors (including affiliation), and publication date, but should be flexible enough to handle any kind of metadata (keywords, copyright, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="typography">Typography</h2>
<p>Scholarly markdown should support superscript and subscript text, and should provide an easy way to enter greek ζ letters.</p>
<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
<p>Tables should work as anchors (i.e. you can link to them) and table captions should support styled text. Unless the table is very simple, tables are probably better written as CSV files with another tool, and then imported into the scholarly markdown document similar to figures.</p>
<table style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 19px; font-family: ff-tisa-sans-web-pro, Arial, sans-serif; width: 750px; margin-bottom: 21px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
<caption><strong>This is the table caption</strong>. We can explain the table here.</caption>
<thead style="box-sizing: border-box;">
<tr class="header header" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
<th style="text-align: center;" style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; font-weight: bold">Centered Header</th>
<th style="text-align: right;" style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; font-weight: bold">Right Aligned</th>

<td style="text-align: right;" style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221)">12.0</td>
<td style="text-align: left;" style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221)">Example of a row that spans multiple lines.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even even" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
<td style="text-align: center;" style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221)">Second</td>
<td style="text-align: right;" style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221)">5.0</td>
<td style="text-align: left;" style="box-sizing: border-box; padding: 8px; vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid rgb(221, 221, 221)">Here’s another one. Note the blank line between rows.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
<p>Figures in scholarly works are separated from the text, and have a figure caption (which can contain styled text). Figures should work as anchors (i.e. you can link to them). Figures can be in different file formats, including TIFF and PDF, and those formats have to be converted into web-friendly formats when exporting to HTML (e.g. PNG and SVG).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/set-operations-illustrated-with-venn-diagrams.png" class="kg-image" width="500" height="500" alt="Set operations illustrated with Venn diagrams. Example taken TeXample.net." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Set operations illustrated with Venn diagrams. Example taken <a href="https://texample.net/tikz/examples/set-operations-illustrated-with-venn-diagrams/">TeXample.net</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="citations-and-links">Citations and Links</h2>
<p>Scholarly articles typically don’t have inline links, but rather citations. The external links (both scholarly identifiers such as DOIs and regular web URLs) are collected in a bibliography at the end of the document, and the citations in the text link to this bibliography. This functionality is similar to footnotes.</p>
<p>Citations should include a citation key in the text, e.g. <code>[@kowalczyk2011]</code>, parsed as (Kowalczyk &amp; Shankar, 2011), and a separate bibliography file in BibTeX (or RIS) format that contains references for all citations. Inserting citations and creating the bibliography can best be done with a reference manager.</p>
<p>Cross-links – i.e. links within a document – are important for scholarly texts. It should be possible to link to section headers (e.g. the beginning of the discussion section), figures and tables.</p>
<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
<p>Complicated math is probably best done in a different authoring environment, but simple formulas, both inline 2‾√x and block elements</p>
<p>ddxarctan(sin(x2))=−2cos(x2)x−2+(cos(x2))2</p>
<p>should be supported by scholarly markdown.</p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p>Comments are important for multi-author documents and if reviewer feedback should be included. Comments should be linked to a particular part of a document to provide context, or attached at the end of a document for general comments. It would also be helpful to “comment out” parts of a document, e.g. to indicate parts that are incomplete and need more work. Revisions of a markdown document are best handled using a version control system such as git.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber for writing content for the web. Other popular lightweight markup languages are Textile and Mediawiki. Whereas Mediawiki markup is of course popular thanks to the ubiquitous Wikipedia, Markdown seems to have gained momentum among scholars. Markdown really focuses on writing content, many of the features of today’s word processors are just a distraction (e.g. fonts, line spacing or style sheets). Adding markup for document structure (e.g. title, authors or abstract) on the other hand is overly complicated with tools such as Microsft Word.</p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately there are several versions (or flavors) of Markdown. The original specification by John Gruber hasn’t been updated for years. Github uses Markdown with some minor modifications. Multimarkdown and Pandoc provide features important for scholarly content, e.g. citations, superscript and tables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>Github-flavored Markdown</li>
<li>Multimarkdown</li>
<li>Pandoc</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pandoc flavor of Markdown probably comes closest to the requirements of a scholar, but still has limitations, e.g. support for metadata and tables isn’t very flexible. I propose that we as a community create a new Scholarly Markdown flavor, which takes into account most of the use cases important for scholarly content.</p>
<p>One of the big advantages of Markdown is that the format can not only be translated to HTML, but also to other formats, and Pandoc is particularly good in translating to and from many different formats. We want to make sure that Scholarly Markdown not only translates into nice Scholarly HTML (with good support for HTML5 tags relevant for scholars), but also into Microsot Word, LaTeX and PDF, as these are the formats typically required by manuscript tracking systems.</p>
<p>Some of the features required for Scholarly Markdown include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Superscript and subscript</li>
<li>Highlighting text (supporting the HTML tag <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code>)</li>
<li>Captions for tables and figures (with support for the HTML tags <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>)</li>
<li>Support for document sections (the HTML5 tags <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>)</li>
<li>Good table support</li>
<li>Math support</li>
<li>Good citation support</li>
<li>Support for comments and annotations</li>
</ul>
<p>Multimarkdown and Pandoc of course already support many of these features. Tables and citations are two examples where it is important to not only support them, but support them in a non-intrusive way that doesn’t get in the way of the flow of writing.</p>
<p>BTW, this wouldn’t be the first community flavor for Markdown. The screenwriting community has done this already with <a href="http://fountain.io/">Fountain</a>.</p>

<p>I was invited to work with ORCID in early 2010 after writing about the initiative that was started in November 2009 on this blog (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid_or_how_to_build_a_unique_identifier_for_scientists_in_10_easy_steps/">ORCID or how to build a unique identifier for scientists in 10 easy steps</a>). And now, after three years and a lot of work by a lot of people, ORCID is real and everyone can use the system. As a researcher, you can go to the ORCID website and register.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Obtaining a number is of course not very interesting in itself, few people get excited about the fact of having a 16-digit unique identifier. What ORCID is really about is claiming your publications and other scholarly works, and <strong>Connecting Research and Researchers</strong> is the slogan of the organization. In the ORCID system you can now claim publications found in the CrossRef database, and other work types will be added over time.</p>
<p>What I’m particularly interested in is the claiming of research datasets. Everyone wants to give researchers better credit for the data they have produced, transformed and annotated, but data citation is still not a widespread practice. I am therefore very excited to be involved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://www.odin-project.eu/">ORCID and DataCite Interoperability Network</a> (ODIN), a EU-funded project that had its kickoff meeting last week in Berlin.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/odin-500x319.png" class="kg-image" width="500" height="319" />
</figure>
<p>In the ODIN project we will work closely with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, an organization that provides digital object identifiers (DOIs) for research data. One of the many things I like about ODIN is that social sciences is one of the disciplines where we will build a proof of concept (with the British Library, the other discipline is high-energy physics and CERN). We also want to understand how to best link researchers, data and publications. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a> is an ODIN project partner and obviously has a lot of experience linking biological datasets to publications, and we will discuss how to integrate ORCID identifiers into the workflow.</p>
<p>Unique identifiers for researchers are of course also an essential part of any work on article-level metrics. I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/06/25/random-notes-from-the-altmetrics12-conference/">spoke about this</a> at the altmetrics12 conference in June, and I’m excited that we can now finally start linking things together. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> was one of the ORCID launch partners, and I demoed their ORCID integration last week in Berlin.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is a fork of the open source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics application</a>, and is a project I started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/">about a year ago</a>. ScienceCard allows researchers to list all their publications, and the metrics associated with them. With the launch of ORCID I was able to finally add one important missing piece. Through automatic lookup of the ORCID identifier and retrieval of the publications claimed in the ORCID profile is has become much easier to create and maintain a ScienceCard profile – it shouldn’t take more than 5 min and a few mouse clicks (collecting all metrics takes longer because that happens in the background). I added ORCID integration to ScienceCard over the weekend, using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://dev.orcid.org/resources">free public ORCID API</a>.</p>

<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/sciencecard-500x438.png" class="kg-image" width="500" height="438" />
</figure>
<p>ScienceCard is a great tool to explore how research impact can be collected and displayed, and I appreciate feedback in the form of feature requests and bug reports, ideally in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/https://github.com/mfenner/alm/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> of the project. This will also provide very valuable feedback to improve the PLOS Article-Level Metrics application, as they use almost the same code base. The API is for example completely the same, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/https://github.com/ropensci/rplos">rplos</a> and other tools using the PLOS ALM API can be used with ScienceCard by just changing the URL. Another example is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/plos-alm-widget/">PLOS ALM WordPress Widget</a>, with minor modifications it can be also be used with ScienceCard, allowing a researcher to display the metrics for his publications from PLOS and other sources on his blog. The upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120701/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/">Altmetrics workshop and hackathon</a> (November 1-3 in San Francisco) will be a great opportunity to explore this further.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly a year ago (in the hackathon of the Science Online London 2011 conference) I <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/announcing-sciencecard/">started the ScienceCard project</a>. ScienceCard is a fork of the Open Source PLOS Article-Level Metrics (ALM) code, personalizing the Article-Level Metrics.</p>
<p>A lot has happened in the last 12 months, most importantly that I started to work for PLOS as technical lead for the Article-Level Metrics project in May. In July, version 2.0 of the PLOS ALM application was released, and the code made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/https://github.com/articlemetrics/alm">available on Github</a>. This not only means that everyone can install his own ALM application (assuming some familiarity with the Ruby and Rails web framework), but that we can fork the code and modify it.</p>
<p>Although my focus is now clearly on improving the PLOS application, it didn’t feel right to shut down the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> project. I really like the idea of personalized Article-Level Metrics (something I spoke about at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/06/25/random-notes-from-the-altmetrics12-conference/">altmetrics12</a> conference). So I sat down the last two weekends to upgrade ScienceCard to the PLOS ALM 2.0 code (the source code of my fork can be found <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/alm">here</a>). With the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://about.orcid.org/content/orcid-launch-plan-announced">imminent launch</a> of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) service next month I dropped the functionality to get all articles by a particular person from Microsoft Academic Search. For now you can add your articles by DOI or PubMed ID (currently only articles from PubMed), but you can now also add interesting articles not authored by you. This makes ScienceCard a nice tool to try out the PLOS ALM code without installing the software. Please remember that all metrics are collected in the background, so it can take a few hours until they show up for newly added articles.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>ScienceCard also shows the power of open source software. Open source doesn’t simply mean free software, it means that you can modify the code if your requirements are different. For ScienceCard I added authentication via Twitter (required to add articles, I don’t want to deal with usernames and passwords), a simple lookup by DOI or PubMed ID (something not needed if you are publisher of the article and have that information), and comments and likes. Article-Level Metrics is not about collecting numbers, it is about capturing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402053034/http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2011/04/06/richard-smith-what-is-post-publication-peer-review/">activity surrounding an article post-publication</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by four recent blog posts and their comments (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/comments-at-journals-websites-just-turn-them-off/">Comments at journal websites: just turn them off</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://figshare.com/blog/Open_Access_and_The_Dramatic_Growth_of_PLoS_ONE/41">Open Access and The Dramatic Growth of PLoS ONE</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2012/07/23/no-comment/">No Comment?</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://perlsteinlab.com/round-table/if-you-email-it-they-will-comment">If you email it, they will comment</a>), I created a graphic to show what users do with PLoS ONE papers. As always, the data behind the graphic are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action">openly available</a>. I think that the number of times a paper is informally discussed (comments, Facebook, science blogs, etc.) should be much larger compared to the numer of formal citations. The challenge is of course to have technology that captures all these discussions – this is much more difficult than for bookmarks or citations, and is obviously what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a> is all about. The blog posts I link to above also express another feeling: that there are still too many barriers for scientists to take part in the informal discussion of scholarly research on the web, in particular as comments on journal websites. Hat tip to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://www.davidmccandless.com/">David McCandless</a> for inspiration.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037945">DNA Barcoding the Native Flowering Plants and Conifers of Wales</a> has been one of the most popular new <em>PLoS ONE</em> papers in June. In the paper Natasha de Vere <em>et al.</em> describe a DNA barcode resource that covers the 1143 native Welsh flowering plants and conifers.</p>
<p>My new job as technical lead for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLoS Article Level Metrics (ALM) project</a> involves thinking about how we can best display the ALM collected for this and other papers. We want these ALM to tell us something important and/or interesting, and it doesn’t hurt if the information is displayed in a visually appealing way. There are many different ways this can be done, but here I want to focus on <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>CiteULike</strong>, the only two data sources where PLoS is currently storing every single event (tweet or CiteULike bookmark) with a date. Usage data (HTML and XML views, PDF downloads) are aggregated on a monthly basis, and PLoS doesn’t store the publication dates of citations.</p>
<p>We know from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">work of Gunter Eysenbach</a> and others that most tweets linking to scholarly papers are written in the first few days after publication. It therefore makes sense to display this information on a timeline covering the first 30 days after publication, and the tweets about the de Vere paper follow the same pattern.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/sparklines.png" title="sparklines" class="kg-image" width="500" height="375" />
</figure>
<p>I like the simplicity of sparklines. It would be interesting to also map the 274 Facebook <strong>Likes, Comments</strong> and <strong>Shares</strong>, but we don’t have date information for them. The same is true for the 9 Mendeley readers and groups.</p>
<p>Another way to display the time course of tweets (or bookmarks) is to use a calendar heat map (the paper was published June 6).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/calendarPlot.png" title="calendarPlot" class="kg-image" width="500" height="320" />

<p>The chart looks a little bit empty, a calendar heat map probably works better for information with many daily data points. I would appreciate feedback on how these visualizations can be improved.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/">altmetrics12</a> workshop in Chicago. You can read all 11 abstracts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/program/">here</a>, and the conference had good Twitter coverage (using the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/https://twitter.com/search/%23altmetrics12">#altmetrics12</a>), at least until Twitter had a total blackout around 12 PM our time.</p>
<p>All but two presenters used slides – I have uploaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/https://speakerdeck.com/u/mfenner/p/altmetrics-will-be-taken-personally-at-plos">my presentation</a> to Speaker Deck. Kelli Barr used the blackboard to explain that</p>
<ul>
<li>filtering (via altmetrics or any other means) by definition always selects out content and therefore runs against the democratization of science</li>
<li>peer review is a black box. altmetrics is also a black box, only much bigger</li>
</ul>

<p>altmetrics12 was one of the best conferences that I have attended recently. The intensity of the discussions was palpable. My only regrets are that there wasn’t more time for discussions, but many of us convened in the bar afterwards.</p>
<p>We were off to a very strong start with two excellent keynote presentations by Johann Bollen ( Altmetrics: from usage data to social media) and Gregg Gordon (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrnblog.com/2012/05/18/alternative-is-the-new-grey/">Alternative is the new Grey</a>). Johann emphasized why it is both important and fascinating to study how science is actually working. He stressed that science is a gift economy, where the currency is acknowledgement of influence in the form of citations. He sees two major problems with the present citation-based analysis of scientific impact: a) data and b) the metrics. Citation data are very domain specific (with very different citation practices in different disciplines), and delayed (several years after publication of the research they are citing). The problem with current citation-based metrics is that they ignore the network effect in science. Johann then went on to explain the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://mesur.informatics.indiana.edu/">MESUR</a> project, which studies the patterns of scientific activity on a very large scale (1 billion usage events, 500 million citations, 50 million papers).</p>

</figure>
<p>Johann then briefly explained the results of another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022">2009 PLoS ONE paper</a> where he analyzed 39 metrics with principal component analysis. He found two major components in the metrics analysis: counting vs. social influence and fast vs. slow.</p>

</figure>
<p>Johann then told the interesting story behind a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3003">2010 paper</a> where he showed that <strong>Twitter mood can predict the stock market</strong>. The paper was rejected by all publishers and was finally published on ArXiV in October 2010. It immediately became very popular in terms of downloads and media attention (and was eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007">published</a> in the <em>Journal of Computational Science</em> in March 2011).</p>
<p>Gregg Gordon has summarized his keynote in a May <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrnblog.com/2012/05/18/alternative-is-the-new-grey/">blogpost</a>, so I will focus on a few highlights. Gregg Gordon runs the Social Science Research Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrn.com/">SSRN</a>), a leading resource for sharing social sciences research. Gregg thinks that altmetrics can provide the compass to navigate the map of science described earlier. He told us some very interesting anecdotes of users trying to game SSRN by inflating their download counts (e.g. “downloads for donuts”), and mentioned a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1346397">research paper</a>analyzing gaming at SSRN. Download counts are apparently taken very seriously by SSRN authors and are also used for hiring decisions. SSRN not only has written software to protect against gaming, but also has a person constantly looking over these numbers (Gregg feels that computer algorithms alone are not enough).</p>
<p>The two keynotes were followed by 11 short (10-15 minute) presentations, including two presentations about the PLoS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article-Level Metrics</a> project. Jennifer Lin spoke about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/lin/">anti-gaming mechanisms</a> and I emphasized the importance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/fenner/">personalizing altmetrics</a> to fully understand the “network of science”. All presentation abstracts are available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/program/">online</a>.</p>
<p>After the lunch break (and some interesting discussions) we continued with demos of various altmetrics applications and users, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://total-impact.org/">Total Impact</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.plumanalytics.com/">Plum Analytics</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://alm.plos.org/">PLoS Article-Level Metrics</a> application, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://knodeinc.com/">Knode</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://academia.edu/">Academia.edu</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.biomedcentral.com/">BioMed Central</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.ubiquitypress.com/">Ubiquity Press</a> (example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/article/intensive-survey-data-from-antikythera-greece/">here</a>).</p>
<p>In the last our and a half we split up into several smaller group to discuss issues relevant for altmetrics. I was in the <strong>standards</strong> group and we all agreed that it is too early to sep up rigid standards for this evolving field, but not too early to start the discussion. The two standards experts in our group (Todd Carpenter from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</a> and David Baker from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://casrai.org/">CASRAI</a>) were of course very helpful with the discussion in our group. In the closing group discussion the breakout groups reported their major discussion points (which will hopefully be written up by someone). We also learned that the NIH is considering changing the Biosketch format for CVs and is looking for input via a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-12-115.html">Request for Information</a> (RFI) until June 29.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has become common practice to make presentation slides available for those unable to attend in person, or for more in-depth review later. The most popular service to do this is of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a>. Slideshare is a fine service, but the website has become fairly cluttered over the years, and visuals are of course important when it comes to presentations.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://speakerdeck.com/">Speaker Deck</a> is an alternative to Slideshare with a focus on “simplicity and beauty”. The service has the features you would expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>upload presentations (currently in PDF only)</li>
<li>view presentations, including fullscreen mode</li>
<li>share presentations, including downloads and embedding</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>Speaker Deck was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/share-presentations-without-the-mess/">announced last September</a> and is free to use. It would be helpful if Speaker Deck allowed the upload of Powerpoint or Keynote files, making it easier to reuse the slides. But the big item on my wish list is an improvement of the social activities enabled around a presentation. I want to see download counts, comments, number of tweets and Facebook likes, and I want an API for them. Ordered List, the company behind Speakerdeck, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/ordered-list-acquired-by-github/">acquired by Github</a> in December, turning Speaker Deck into a Github product. This makes me confident that we will see these Speaker Deck improvements rather sooner than later.</p>
<p>To see a few Speaker Deck presentations, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/https://speakerdeck.com/u/mfenner">my presentations</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/https://speakerdeck.com/c/science">Science category</a>.</p>

These <a href="https://front-matter.io/interviews">interviews</a> have always been among my favorite blog posts. This now is obviously an interview with myself, but I felt this is the best format to explain some important news.</p>

<p>Starting May 16 I will be working full-time as technical lead for the PLoS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article Level Metrics</a> (ALM) project. I will help with development of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">PLoS ALM application</a>, and will do community developer outreach for this project.</p>
<p>The PLoS ALM application is written in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, an open-source web framework I have been working with since 2005. The ALM project was launched in 2009, and I first learned about ALM in a July 2009 presentation by Pete Binfield at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">SciBarCamp Palo Alto</a>. A month later I did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">interview with Pete</a> about Article Level Metrics and PLoS ONE.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-article-level-metrics">What is Article Level Metrics?</h3>
<p>Article Level Metrics <em>place transparent and  comprehensive information about the usage and reach of published articles onto the articles themselves, so that the entire academic community can assess their value</em> (from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLoS ALM website</a>). A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000242">November 2009 paper</a> by Cameron Neylon and Shirley Wu gives a more detailed introduction. And a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://www.slideshare.net/kristenratan/metrics-the-new-black">recent presentation</a> by Kristen Ratan, PLoS Director of Product Management, given at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://www.nfais.org/page/361-program-2012-nfais-annual-conference">2012 NFAIS meeting</a>, provides an update for 2012.</p>
<p>Article Level Metrics is part of the larger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a> movement, which also looks at metrics for other scholarly works besides journal articles.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-mean-that-you-will-be-moving-to-san-francisco">Does this mean that you will be moving to San Francisco?</h3>
<p>For personal reasons I will continue to live in Hannover, Germany and work from home as a contractor with occasional trips to San Francisco.</p>
<h3 id="will-you-miss-treating-cancer-patients-and-doing-cancer-research">Will you miss treating cancer patients and doing cancer research?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. This has not been an easy decision. To make the transition easier, I will continue to spend 10% of my time at Hannover Medical School. I will no longer be seeing patients, but this will allow me to conclude the RADIT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242631">clinical trial</a> for testicular cancer patients where I am the principal investigator.</p>
<p>I hope to continue doing research in the new position, but with a focus on information science. There are for example still a lot of things we don’t know about altmetrics. A more detailed analysis of our recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/19/crowdsourcing-the-analysis-of-scholarly-tweets/">CrowdoMeter</a> project (a crowdsourced analysis of tweets linking to scholarly papers) would be a good start.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-happen-with-sciencecard">What will happen with ScienceCard?</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is a website that collects author level metrics and was my entry into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/">Mendeley/PLoS Binary Battle API contest</a> last fall. ScienceCard is based on the PLoS ALM code (which is open source and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">available via Google Code</a>). I will decide in the coming months what to do with ScienceCard. This depends mainly on how much author level metrics make sense in the PLoS ALM project.</p>
<h3 id="and-what-will-happen-to-your-other-scholarly-communication-activities">And what will happen to your other scholarly communication activities?</h3>
<p>There is no reason not to continue my other activities, including involvement in the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://about.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) initiative, and using WordPress as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/">tool to write and publish manuscripts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-future-plans-for-this-blog">What are your future plans for this blog?</h3>
<p>I plan to continue this blog in a very similar format, and I will have more time for more in-depth articles. And of course I will indicate a conflict of interest when I write about Article Level Metrics.</p>

<p>Scientists may feel uncomfortable about marketing their work, but we all are doing it already. We know that giving a presentation at a key meeting can be a boost for our career, and we know about the importance of maintaining an academic homepage listing our research interests and publications. And people reading this blog will understand that a science blog can be a powerful marketing tool.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://altmetrics.org/">Altmetrics</a> – tools to assess the impact of scholarly works based on alternative online measures such as bookmarks, links, blog posts, etc. –have become a regular topic in this blog. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics manifesto</a> was published in October 2010, and in the last 18 months we have seen a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://altmetrics.org/tools/">number of interesting new altmetrics services</a>, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://blogs.plos.org/blog/tag/sciencecard/">ScienceCard</a> service that I started six months ago. ScienceCard has been a very interesting learning experience, because I not only had to write the software, but also think about my perspective on altmetrics. Some of my recent thoughts are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>FriendFeed still is a great model for a scholarly service</strong><br />
I have stopped using FriendFeed a few months ago in favor of Twitter, but I still very much like the design of the service. I think that the concept should also work very well for altmetrics, and I have therefore continued work on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_stream">activity stream</a> for ScienceCard. At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://sciencecard.org/works">http://sciencecard.org/works</a> you find a listing of all recent scholarly works of your ScienceCard friends, and now you can like/comment/share them. ScienceCard friends are the people you follow on Twitter who also have a ScienceCard account and sharing is possible via Mendeley and CiteULike. Comments are still in the testing stage, and Twitter integration is also in the works. I also want to add more scholarly content including Slideshare presentations and blog posts, although the latter are really hard to do in an automated way.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Altmetrics tools should not only present scholarly works and their metrics, but they should also allow users to interact with them via sharing, commenting, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Altmetrics is about search</strong><br />
Altmetrics is really about two related concepts: reputation and discovery. ScienceCard tries to summarize the metrics available about a particular researcher, although much more work needs to be done to show that these numbers correlate with reputation. The discovery aspect of altmetrics is at least as important, and this means that these alternative metrics should help provide better search results. Some bibliographic databases let you sort your search results by number of citations – the problem is of course that citations can have a delay of several years. Download counts, social bookmarks, Twitter links, etc. on the other hand can give information about the impact of a paper within days of publication. The search results can be improved further by personalizing them based on what the friends in your social network are publishing, bookmarking or discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Altmetrics is expensive</strong><br />
It is great to see so many altmetrics grassroots projects. Unfortunately it is resource-intensive and therefore costly to collect altmetrics, in particular if it is almost real-time numbers such as Twitter citations. I’m afraid that many people (including myself) will have a hard time providing this service in a sustainable way. There are two possible solutions: providing altmetrics as a commercial service, and providing altmetrics as a collaborative effort. Although I understand the reasoning behind commercial services, I would very much prefer the open and collaborative approach. Collaboration could mean that several people and/or organizations join forces and run an altmetrics service together, but it could also mean that we break altmetrics into smaller services connected via programming interfaces. A typical altmetrics service has at least these functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>an interface to add journal articles and other scholarly objects, whether it is manual input by users or via an API</li>
<li>a searchable database with metadata about scholarly objects</li>
<li>a background service that collects metrics from other sources</li>
<li>a public interface that displays metrics for particular scholarly objects and collections</li>
<li>an interface for visualization and analysis of aggregate numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t think that all five functions (and possibly more) necessarily have to be provided by the same service. I’m sure that there are enough people that are only interested in providing interesting ways to add scholarly objects, or in visualization and analysis. The background service is probably the most boring and resource-intensive part.</p>
<p><strong>I want second-order metrics</strong><br />
Second-order metrics means the metrics for the scholarly works citing a particular paper or for the person bookmarking or tweeting a scholarly work. This approach would add valuable information and is obviously similar to the PageRank algorithm for web links. Unfortunately this approach also creates a lot of extra work, as this means collecting the metrics (or at least some metrics) for all citing works. Again something that makes altmetrics expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter is important</strong><br />
Many of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/02/09/more-tweets-more-citations/">recent altmetrics discussions</a> have really been about the role of Twitter in scholarly communication. A lot of people are excited about the potential of Twitter to help discover interesting scholarly works, and to allow this within days after publication. It is still too early to know for sure whether <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">highly tweeted papers will be cited more often later on</a>. Better Twitter integration is high on my to do list for ScienceCard.</p>
<p><strong>Yet another bibliographic database</strong><br />
The core function of altmetrics is to build a database with metadata about scholarly objects, including a variety of metrics. There are of course a large number of bibliographic databases already out there, so maybe existing databases can also be extended to include metrics. Ideally the existing database should not be restricted to particular kinds of scholarly works (e.g. journal articles) or disciplines, should be free to use and should allow reuse of the data with an appropriate license. There are several candidates that fit this description, includind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://bibsoup.net/">BibSoup</a> run by the Open Knowledge Foundation and possibly also the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528083343/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> database allowing synchronization with the desktop reference manager. Both services focus on biobliographic collections uploaded by users, whereas my idea of an altmetrics database relies on disambiguated authors and scholarly works.</p>
<p><strong>There are too many altmetrics</strong><br />
It is great that altmetrics increases the variety of available metrics, but too many different metrics can be confusing to users. Although it is interesting that the number of citations for the same work vary widely between PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Microsoft Academic Search, Pubmed and Google Scholar, the typical user is probably only interested in one citation count. The same is true for usage metrics and number of social bookmarks. I think it would be helpful to consolidate the metrics about a scholarly work to maybe five numbers, including views/downloads, bookmarks, citations, comments, and tweets. This doesn’t mean that the other information shouldn’t be collected, just that the numbers will be consolidated for display.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was another week with a fair amount of spam in my email inbox. We all receive email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE">spam</a> on a regular basis and most of us have probably also received science spam: invitations to scientific conferences about topics we are not working on, invitations to submit articles to journals not covering your field, and information about lab supplies we never had asked for. Although I’m of course aware that spam is now a fact of online life, I don’t quiet understand how this science spam works.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722im_/http://farm1.staticflickr.com/206/519906069_de5953764a_m.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Flickr photo by AJ Cann." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajc1/519906069/in/photostream/">Flickr photo</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://scienceoftheinvisible.blogspot.com/">AJ Cann</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>1. How do science spammers get my email address?</strong><br />
Most science spam is not really targeted towards my research interests. From this I conclude that these spammers automatically harvest email addresses of researchers, or they buy these lists. One potential source to harvest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/07/13/did-you-receive-spam-because-you-published-a-paper/">email addresses is PubMed</a> and other bibliographic databases, but I don’t know whether this is actually done.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is even a small percentage of researchers responding to this science spam?</strong><br />
Science spam is as uninteresting to me as any other spam, and I can’t really imagine a colleague submitting a manuscript to a journal marketed this way. But the idea behind spam is that there is a – admittedly very small – conversion rate.</p>
<p><strong>3. When will we start to see more social media science spam?</strong><br />
I think it is only a question of time before we see more science spam on Twitter, Google+ and Facebook – I already receive a small amount of spam through these channels.</p>
<p><strong>4. Is there anything an individual researcher can other than using good spam filters in his email program?</strong><br />
Would it for example help if we hide our email address as much as possible? Should we deny publishers the permission to post our email address in journal articles, and should places like PubMed hide them? Do publisher organizations such as OASPA (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association) enforce their <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234722/http://www.oaspa.org/conduct.php">Member Code of Conduct</a>,</strong> which clearly state that a<em>ny direct marketing activities publishers engage in shall be appropriate and unobtrusive.</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Will it get worse?</strong><br />
I know this answer. Yes. This blog has seen more than 60,000 spam comments already, most of the spam in my email is filtered out before I even see it, but I think it will get much worse – via email and other channels.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In December Euan Adie and I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">started the CrowdoMeter projec</a>t, an analysis of the semantic content of tweets linking to scholarly papers. Because classifying almost 500 tweets is a lot of work, we turned this into a crowdsourcing project. We got help from 36 people, who did 953 classifications, and we discussed the preliminary results (available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">here</a>) at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference.</p>
<p>There is no reason to stop the crowdsourcing here, so we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://hdl.handle.net/10779/01c28ce592291e7e294ed328208a5869">uploaded the result set</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/16/figshare-interview-with-mark-hahnel/">figshare</a> and invite everybody to help us with the data analysis. For this purpose I have created a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer">public repository</a> on Github which contains not only the source code for the CrowdoMeter website, but also all data – the same dataset made available on figshare. I have written a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer/blob/crowdometer/public/assets/shares_author.R">first R script</a> that produces the following pie chart:</p>

</figure>
<p>The figure doesn’t look all that exciting, but there is some calculation involved. There are different numbers of classifications per tweet and sometimes there is disagreement: true means at least 50% of classifications were true. It would be great if we find people willing to help with data analysis, preferably using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://rstudio.org/">R</a> and contributing their scripts to the Github repository.

<p>fig<strong>share</strong> <em>allows researchers to publish all of their research outputs in seconds in an easily citable, sharable and discoverable manner</em>. The service was started by Mark Hahnel last year while still a PhD student. Mark joined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a> to work on fig<strong>share</strong> in September and last month relaunched a much improved version of the service. I asked Mark a few questions about fig<strong>share</strong> below. I also uploaded two datasetst to fig<strong>share</strong> and made them publicly available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://hdl.handle.net/10779/1c48a305c08c717fea3f6fe1687b3eff">CrowdoMeter Tweets</a> – all 467 tweets used in the CrowdoMeter project</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="1-what-is-figshare">1. What is figshare?</h2>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://figshare.com/">figshare</a> is a repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable, sharable and discoverable manner. figshare allows users to upload any file format so that figures, datasets and media can be disseminated in a way that the current scholarly publishing model does not allow.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/screenshot.png" title="screenshot" class="kg-image" width="500" height="258" />
</figure>
<h2 id="2-what-is-the-right-content-for-figshare-and-what-should-rather-go-somewhere-else">2. What is the right content for figshare? And what should rather go somewhere else?</h2>
<p>Every experiment that is completed without error in the methods is valuable. Researchers investigate things because the question is interesting and supposedly unanswered. This means that other researchers will at some point ask that same question. Just because the hypothesis didn’t turn out to be true, doesn’t mean that this data should be thrown away.</p>
<p>With fig<strong>share</strong>, you can share your negative results or results that you were not planning to publish. You can make raw data available or supplementary material that journals cannot handle linked to from the published article. You can even make your papers and posters available and citable. People have uploaded whole chapters of their PhD thesis to share with the world and make sure that all of their hard work is not wasted.</p>
<p>Currently we are not focusing on handling massive datasets, whilst this is an aim for the future. These edge cases seem to be better handled by journals set up specifically for publishing these huge files, such as the excellent <span>GigaScience</span>.</p>
<h2 id="3-you-relaunched-figshare-in-january-what-has-changed-to-the-previous-version">3. You relaunched figshare in January. What has changed to the previous version?</h2>
<p>The old site was a proof of concept based on Mediawiki software. The new site has been completely built from scratch so that it is rapidly extendable in terms of features and scale. This means that we can adapt quickly and easily to the needs of researchers. As well as being much more intuitive, the biggest new feature for fig<strong>share</strong> is the private space.</p>
<p>Whilst we would like everyone to make all of their research objects available, we appreciate that some researchers would like to keep research private for many reasons. Because of this we set about giving users their own private repository to store their research objects. These objects can be uploaded in seconds and all objects are initially held in the private space, from where they can be made publicly available when the user decides. All research is easily tagged and categorisable, so that researchers can filter through their many files to find the one they were looking for in no time at all.</p>
<h2 id="4-how-important-is-the-user-interface-for-figshare-what-particular-features-do-you-like-the-most">4. How important is the user interface for figshare? What particular features do you like the most?</h2>
<p>The user interface is essential, researchers are busy enough as it it. They haven’t got the time to attend training course on how to use a repository. If this was the case with facebook, no one would use facebook. For this reason fig<strong>share</strong> is stupidly simple and allows users to get their research onto the site in seconds, even the PIs. At this point they can choose to make it publicly available and immediately citable, sharable and discoverable, or keep it private – securely hosted, taggable and accessible when they need it, from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This is something we are constantly aiming to improve and we not only welcome feedback, we are actively seeking the thoughts of researchers on how we can make this a seemless part of their research process.</p>
<h2 id="5-do-you-have-plans-for-a-desktop-version-of-figshare-e-g-to-watch-folders-for-new-figshare-content">5. Do you have plans for a desktop version of figshare, e.g. to watch folders for new figshare content?</h2>
<p>We do! By creating a desktop uploader, the process becomes even more intuitive for researchers, allowing them to make backups of their research in the cloud with no effort expenditure. Research data management is something I personally was terrible at. My research was organised into folders based on the month and the year I did that work. I lost days trying to find files that ‘I know I worked on sometime last summer’. Hopefully a desktop uploader will add to the current simple management system so that researchers like me have no excuse when it comes to losing (often expensive) results files.</p>
<h2 id="6-how-is-figshare-different-from-data-repositories">6. How is figshare different from data repositories?</h2>
<p>fig<strong>share</strong> is not limited as many repositories are. It caters for all research domains, no matter where your research is carried out. Institutional repositories are often limited to members of said institution. Also, the majority of institutional repositories are built specifically for papers. The Dryad repository has been doing some great work making the datasets behind published articles available under CC0. fig<strong>share</strong> is not limited by the normal constraints of publishing, data generated in the lab can be shared and made available to the world as a citable object the same day.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/usermetrics.png" title="usermetrics" class="kg-image" width="275" height="115" />

<p>fig<strong>share</strong> also gives the researchers the credit for their research. By adding metrics to the public uploads, and putting the cumulative metrics of a researcher’s uploads on their profile, users can see the true impact and reach of the hard work they put in.</p>
<h2 id="7-you-currently-use-handles-for-figshare-content-what-are-your-thoughts-on-persistent-identifiers-are-the-plans-to-use-dois">7. You currently use handles for figshare content. What are your thoughts on persistent identifiers? Are the plans to use DOIs?</h2>
<p>Persistent identifiers are essential for the long term availability of research outputs. One of the reasons I set up figshare was because I wanted to cite a video in my thesis. Research data on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://figshare.com/blog/A%20YouTube%20%20for%20Scientists/11">YouTube</a> is not easily citable, by adding persitent identifiers and an organised citation structure, videos as well as any other file format can be easily cited. All citations can be exported to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.refman.com/">RefMan</a>with one click. We use handles at the moment, but have noticed that researchers tend to be more familiar with DOI’s and so will be making the move over to them shortly. We’re currently working with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> through the British Library to get this set up.</p>
<h2 id="8-how-does-figshare-guarantee-long-term-preservation-of-uploaded-data">8. How does figshare guarantee long-term preservation of uploaded data?</h2>
<p>The long term persistence of this research data is essential. The research is backed up locally as soon as it is uploaded. We are currently in talks with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171633/http://www.portico.org/">Portico</a> to back up all data and further guarantee this long term persistence.</p>
<h2 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-figshare-what-did-you-do-before-figshare">9. What are your responsibilities at figshare? What did you do before Figshare?</h2>
<p>I’m basically responsible for making the platform as useful for researchers as possible. I also love going to talk at Universities and conferences to researchers directly, to hear their thoughts/opinions. As a former life science researcher (I finished my PhD in stem cell biology at Imperial College London in September), I understand that what makes sense in a rational world does not make sense in the scientific world. You just have to look at the established model of scientific research dissemination to understand that. fig<strong>share</strong> is useful whether you want to make all of your research outputs available or none. Science would just be a lot more efficient and dynamic if they did.</p>

The default open access license is CC-BY, and CC0 for data.</p>
<p>Important features include:</p>
<ol>
<li>immediate publication</li>
<li>open, post-publication peer review</li>
<li>revisioning of work</li>
<li>raw data repository</li>
<li>article format and content is not predefined</li>

<p>F1000 Research is a <em>publishing program</em> rather than a journal. The format for F1000 Research hasn’t been finalized, and F1000 welcomes comments at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://f1000research.com/">blog</a> or via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/https://twitter.com/#!/F1000Research">Twitter</a> account.</p>
<p>My main question about F1000 Research: is this a preprint archive similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>? I’m a big fan of preprint archives, and I think that – contrary to what most people think – they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">should work particularly well</a> for clinical trial data.</p>

<p>Together with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://twitter.com/Stew">Euan Adie</a> I moderated a session on Friday:</p>
<h2 id="using-altmetrics-tools-to-track-the-scholarly-impact-of-your-research-">Using altmetrics tools to track the scholarly impact of your research.</h2>
<p>We started the session by asking several people in the audience to demonstrate their altmetrics tools: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a> (Euan Adie), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://readermeter.org/">ReaderMeter</a> (Dario Taraborelli), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://total-impact.org/">Total Impact</a> (Jason Priem), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLoS Article-Level Metrics</a> (Jennifer Lin), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> (me). We briefly showed our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://crowdometer.org/">CrowdoMeter</a> project where we crowdsourced the meaning of tweets about scholarly papers.</p>
<p>The discussion covered many interesting aspects. I would like to focus on three of them.</p>
<h3 id="gaming">Gaming</h3>
<p>Altmetrics are still fairly new, and therefore not many people try to the cheat yet (but almost 1% of tweets in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">CrowdoMeter dataset</a> were already spam). I’m sure that this will change over time, and some metrics will be more prone to gaming than others. Gaming is a particular problem for usage stats, as it is difficult to impossible to verify them. Metrics provided by the producer of a research object (author or publisher) will be more susceptible to gaming than metrics from an independent source. Anonymous metrics (e.g. Mendeley readers) are more susceptible to gaming than metrics that list the source of every citation (e.g. CiteULike bookmarks).</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>Altmetrics is currently at a stage where we collect various metrics, but don’t really know what these numbers mean. Does 1,000 downloads, 10 Mendeley bookmarks or 50 tweets mean that the paper has impact? And how do we compare altmetrics from different disciplines? Does it make a difference if a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/fields/details/">Fields Medalist</a> blogs about your paper (an example given in the session)? I think that the most interesting metrics are those that take into account who is citing the work, being it a regular citation, a social bookmark or a social media comment. This is of course how Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> works for webpages, and how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000038/http://www.eigenfactor.org/">Eigenfactor</a> ranks scholarly journals. The context can be further improved by including the social networks of the person looking for information, e.g. how many people I follow on Twitter have bookmarked this particular paper.</p>
<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>The tools discussed in the ScienceOnline session all have a particular approach for gathering altmetrics: altmetrics over a given time period (<em>altmetric.com</em>), altmetrics for content produced by a particular publisher (<em>PLoS ALM</em>), altmetrics for a given researcher (<em>ReaderMeter</em> and <em>ScienceCard</em>), and altmetrics produced for a given dataset on demand (<em>Total-Impact</em>). One obvious advantage of this approach is that it reduces the number of datasets needed to run the service. Unfortunately this is an arbitrary distinction, and it falls apart when you use a PageRank approach and also look at the metrics of citing sources.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>I think that altmetrics has made tremendous progress in 2011, but that there is a lot of work to do in 2012. I’m very interested in altmetrics based on PageRank, but also want to take social networks into consideration. This is of course how finding information on the web works – scholarly communication is just a subset. Unfortunately this approach requires a massive database of scholarly citations, something that is impossible to do for the small part-time altmetrics projects mentioned at the beginning of the post.</p>
<p>I’m less interested in usage metrics because they are so prone to gaming and will probably become problematic in a few years, and I want to focus on a reasonable number of altmetrics. I hope that there will never be a single “altmetric”, but I also don’t think that we need 20 different altmetrics for every scholarly work. A lot of interesting work ahead for my ScienceCard project.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to the altmetrics session at ScienceOnline2013.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Sloan Foundation has awarded a $125,000 grant to Columbia University and Mendeley to fund the development of a <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">Citation-Style Language</a> (CSL) editor. CSL is a XML-based language to format citations and bibliographies, and is used by the reference managers Zotero, Mendeley and Papers, and in many other places. Even though more than 1000 citation styles are available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235632/http://citationstyles.org/">CitationStyles.org</a> (and built into the tools using CSL), it has until now been fairly hard to create new citation styles – editing XML files is not everyones idea of having fun. The CSL editor will be made available as open source software.</p>
<p>Building a dedicated CSL editor will be a tremendous boost to the format.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago Euan Adie from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://altmetric.com/">altmetric.com</a> and myself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">launched</a> the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://crowdometer.org/">CrowdoMeter</a>, a crowdsourcing project that tries to classify tweets about scholarly articles using the Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO). Despite the holidays we have gotten off to a good start with currently 597 classifications by 56 different users, already covering 93% of the tweets we wanted to classify. We will discuss the results of this project at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference in two weeks, but the most important findings can also be watched in real-time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">here</a>.</p>
<p>To our knowledge this is the first time that CiTO has been used for the systematic classification of tweets, and the preliminary results seem to confirm what we and others had thought, i.e. that most tweets contain little semantic information and often only retweet the title of a paper. But not only do we now have numbers to confirm this, but we can also make some interesting additional observations. We find for example that only 1% of tweets disagree with the statements made in a paper – most Twitter users don’t seem to care telling others about papers they dislike or disagree with.</p>
<p>This project is far from over, ideally we want 3-5 classifications per tweet or an additional 1,000 classifications. It is a challenge to build a website so that enough people want to help with this project. One idea is to make the classifications as simple as possible, and to help further with this we today launched a mobile version of CrowdoMeter. Simply browse to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://crowdometer.org/">http://crowdometer.org</a> with your iPhone or Android phone, sign in via your Twitter account, and you should see something similar to this:</p>

<p>CrowdoMeter uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>, a touch-optimized Javascript framework for smartphones and tablets. There are still some minor issues, but in general jQuery Mobile is a great tool to optimize a website for mobile users. Users are presented with 10 random tweets they haven’t classified yet, and see a simple classification screen when clicking (touching) a tweet:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/crowdometer1.png" title="crowdometer1" class="kg-image" width="320" height="480" />
</figure>
<p>It should not take longer than 15 minutes to classify 15-25 tweets, and this would be a tremendous help for the project.</p>
<p>The CrowdoMeter results page displayed the same information as in the desktop version of the website, the charts are produced by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107002621/http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> Javascript library (and again jQuery).</p>

<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/crowdometer2.png" title="crowdometer2" class="kg-image" width="320" height="480" />
</figure>
<p>I’m interested to see how well the crowdsourcing for CrowdoMeter will work in the coming weeks. We hope to finish the data gathering part in January. If this project generates enough interest I could imagine doing another crowdsourcing project, maybe again using the Citation Typing Ontology, but this time for blog posts about scholarly papers.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Version 1.0 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://annotum.org/">Annotum</a>, the free WordPress theme for writing scholarly articles, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/more-spring-cleaning-out-of-season.html">announced</a> in late November. Back in June I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/06/30/annotum-publishing-with-wordpress-soon-coming-to-a-journal-near-you/">wrote about</a> the first public version of Annotum, but until now using Annotum was experimental. Annotum is available in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/annotum-base">WordPress Themes Directory</a> at WordPress.org (and has been downloaded more than 9,000 times in the past three weeks), and is also available for users of WordPress.com. I have installed Annotum 1.0 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://blogs.scienceonlinelondon.org/annotum/">here</a>, please drop me a note if you want an account.</p>
<p>But how is an Annotum blog different from a regular WordPress blog?</p>
<h3 id="annotum-is-a-wordpress-theme">Annotum is a WordPress Theme</h3>
<p>WordPress can be extended via Plugins and Themes. Whereas Plugins add functionality, themes usually change the look and feel of a WordPress site. Annotum is a theme that includes a lot of plugin functionality. This strategy makes it easier to get started with Annotum, as there is only one theme to install and not a set of plugins that has to work with a particular theme. Annotum can still be extended via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">child themes</a>, e.g. if you want a different look for your blog. And of course you can still use other scholarly plugins.</p>
<h3 id="annotum-uses-articles-and-not-posts">Annotum uses articles and not posts</h3>
<p>Annotum uses the custom post type <em><em>article</em></em> for scholarly content. This can be confusing in the beginning, but makes it easier to separate scholarly content from regular blog posts.</p>
<h3 id="the-annotum-editor-knows-about-document-structure"><strong><strong>The Annotum editor knows about document structure</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Scholarly articles have more structure than blog posts, and you can add this structure with the Annotum editor (see below). This structure is enforced, and the WordPress HTML editor is disabled. This makes it easier to create content that conforms to the NLM-DTD XML format.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/annotum1.png" title="annotum1" class="kg-image" width="487" height="319" />
</figure>
<h3 id="annotum-can-import-and-export-in-the-nlm-dtd-format">Annotum can import and export in the NLM-DTD format</h3>
<p>More specifically, Annotum supports the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/kipling/">Kipling subset</a> of the NLM Journal Publishing DTD. NLM-DTD is the standard XML format for scholarly articles, and you can for example import published articles (with a license that allows reuse) into Annotum to get started. Unfortunately there aren’t that many NLM-DTD tools for authors (I haven’t tested the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview-with-pablo-fernicola">Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-In</a> with Annotum), but this is a great way to get content written somewhere else into Annotum.</p>
<h3 id="annotum-knows-that-articles-can-have-multiple-authors">Annotum knows that articles can have multiple authors</h3>
<p>This is of course important for scholarly articles, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/co-authors-plus/">Co-Authors Plus Plugin</a> also adds this feature to any WordPress blog.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/annotum2.png" title="annotum2" class="kg-image" width="416" height="166" />
</figure>
<h3 id="annotum-knows-about-tables-figures-equations-and-references">Annotum knows about tables, figures, equations and references</h3>
<p>Scholarly articles have special formatting requirements for these content types, particularly references. Annotum adds visual editors for all of them. Annotum also has an editor for LaTeX equations.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/annotum4-406x500.png" title="annotum4" class="kg-image" width="406" height="500" />
</figure>
<p>Annotum currently does not integrate with reference managers (Endnote, Mendeley, Zotero, etc.) or other WordPress tools that insert citations into blog posts (e.g <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kcite/">kcite</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-to-link/">Link to Link</a>), but you can look up references via DOI and PubMed ID.</p>
<h3 id="annotum-knows-about-reviewers-and-editors">Annotum knows about reviewers and editors</h3>
<p>Annotum has  a built-in review system that knows about authors, reviewers and editors. Annotum allows comments only visible to authors and reviewers, and sends out notification emails. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://editflow.org/">Edit Flow</a> plugin provides similar functionality.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/annotum3.png" title="annotum3" class="kg-image" width="298" height="206" />
</figure>
<h3 id="annotum-can-export-to-pdf">Annotum can export to PDF</h3>
<p>Annotum automatically creates a PDF version of your article (using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://code.google.com/p/dompdf/">dompdf</a> HTML to PDF converter).  Annotum also works with my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">ePub Export plugin</a>, using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/https://gist.github.com/1046450">this hack</a> to display the ePub link next to the PDF link:</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Annotum is a complete and free solution for starting a scholarly journal using WordPress. It has everything you need to write great scholarly content with WordPress and improves a regular WordPress blog in several important ways. Thanks to the support for the NLM-DTD format, Annotum can also be used as a writing tool for articles intended for submission somewhere else. One of the biggest strengths of WordPress is that it is really a writing <em><em>platform</em></em> that can be extended in many interesting ways. Maybe we will see WordPress plugins that enhance the equation editor or the reference management – or that connect Annotum to traditional journal submission systems.</p>
<p>Science bloggers will also be interested in many of the features of Annotum, but they don’t need the review workflow and might find that the support for NLM-DTD restricts them in how they can write content. Annotum is at version 1.0, and it is therefore not surprising that it still has a few rough edges. My biggest wish for a future version is better support for revisions and inline comments – Google Docs and other collaborative writing tools do a much better job highlighting the changes made in a text.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m very proud to report that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> last week has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://dev.mendeley.com/api-binary-battle">named finalist</a> in the Mendeley/PLoS API Binary Battle. Not bad for a project that started only two months ago in a hackathon following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a> conference and is done in my spare time. The winners of the contest will be named on November 30, but I’m more than happy that the project has even gotten this far.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/11/sciencecard.jpg" title="sciencecard" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>The idea of ScienceCard is threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>make it as easy as possible to create a profile page with your publications</li>
<li>Automatically collect citations and other metrics for these publications</li>
<li>make it as easy as possible to reuse this information, e.g. in your personal blog or reference manager</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration with ScienceCard is easy. You create an account by logging in via Twitter (using the OAuth 2 protocol for the technically inclined), and then add your account name from one or more author identifier services. I added Google Scholar today, the other options are Microsoft Academic Search, AuthorClaim and Mendeley (I’m working on Scopus Author ID). If you add an Microsoft Academic Search or AuthorClaim identifier, ScienceCard will import all your publications from these services. ScienceCard currently only understands publications with a DOI, other scholarly items could be added in the future. With Mendeley and Google Scholar you only link to these services, I’m still having trouble with the Mendeley OAuth 1 authentication and Google Scholar doesn’t have an API.</p>
<p>ScienceCard is importing all the relevant bibliographic information using the CrossRef service. And ScienceCard is creating a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/10/17/serving-shortdois/">shortDOI</a> for all papers. But more interestingly, ScienceCard is calculating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">article-level metrics</a> for all publications, and composite numbers for authors. For this ScienceCard is using the PLoS Article-Level Metrics API code, but I have added more sources, including Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search and altmetric.com (but here only the number of blog posts citing a paper). ScienceCard links to most sources so that you can see the actual citations there, only CrossRef and altmetric.com don’t offer that. A future update will show all citations directly in ScienceCard.</p>
<p>ScienceCard tries to display a nice profile page for each researcher, but also makes it easy to reuse the information somewhere else. Each author page is available in six different formats, simply add the extension after the (Twitter) username, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://sciencecard.org/mfenner.json">http://sciencecard.org/mfenner.json</a></p>
<ul>
<li>HTML – for regular viewing</li>
<li>XML – for reuse by another computer</li>
<li>JSON – for reuse by another computer</li>
<li>CSV – comma-separated values for import into a spreadsheet</li>
<li>RIS – for reuse by a reference manager</li>
<li>BIB – BibTeX, for reuse by a reference manager</li>
</ul>
<p>JSON is the most interesting format, because it makes it very easy to connect two different services. If you for example want to use ScienceCard data on your personal WordPress blog you can simply download my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-info-options/">Contact Info Options WordPress</a> plugin, add your ScienceCard username in your WordPress settings and do some hacking of the author template. The process is unfortunately different for every WordPress theme, but you can see an example WordPress profile that uses the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://annotum.wordpress.com/">Annotum</a> theme (and publishing platform) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://blogs.scienceonlinelondon.org/annotum/author/mfenner/">here</a>:</p>

</figure>
<p>This WordPress author profile is generated on the fly using ScienceCard data, and will therefore automatically update.</p>
<p>The ScienceCard project is still at the beginning, and there are enough ideas to move this project forward in interesting ways. I’m particularly interested in improving the user interface and display of information, in adding datasets and other scholarly content, and in integrating with the ORCID unique author identifier service once the service launches in spring 2012. If you are interested to learn more about ScienceCard, please contact me via email or Twitter, or attend the altmetrics session at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a>, which I will do together with Euan Adie from altmetric.com and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://altmetric.com/interface/plos.html">PLoS Impact Explorer</a>, and Jason Priem from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525033358/http://total-impact.org/">Total Impact</a> (two other Mendeley/PLoS API Binary Battle finalists).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> is one of the most popular file formats for bibliographies, and is therefore commonly used to transfer bibliographies from one reference manager to another, or to other applications that handle bibliographic references. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp">RIS</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.endnote.com/support/helpdocs/endnote.zip">Endnote XML</a> are probably the other two bibliographic file formats most commonly used. Most reference managers support all three formats, making it easy to move references around.</p>
<p>All three formats have been around for a while, BibTeX for example since 1985. Reference management has of course gone through many changes during this time, and an important change will happen next year: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/orcid/">unique identifiers for scholarly authors</a>. In 2012 the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) initiative will start issuing unique identifiers for researchers, and researchers, universities, funding organizations, publishers and hopefully everyone else will start using them. But ORCID will only be successful if as many bibliographic tools as possible can handle ORCID identifiers, and if these tools can exchange these author identifiers.</p>
<p>None of the three bibliographic file formats mentioned above can handle unique author identifiers. If we take for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://sciencecard.org/articles/d6n">this paper</a> from ScienceCard, then the authors would look like this in BibTeX:</p>
<pre><code>author = {Kirstein, Janine and Dougan, David and Gerth, Ulf and Hecker, Michael and Turgay, Kürşad}</code></pre>
<p>And like this in RIS:</p>
<pre><code>AU  - Kirstein, Janine 
AU  - Dougan, David 
AU  - Gerth, Ulf 
AU  - Hecker, Michael 
AU  - Turgay, Kürşad</code></pre>
<p>I suggest we extend the BibTeX  format to understand author identifiers like this:</p>
<pre><code>orcid = {1274643, 8474644, 847412, 9183414, 7461414}</code></pre>
<p>And RIS:</p>
<pre><code>AI  - 1274643 
AI  - 8474644 
AI  - 847412 
AI  - 9183414 
AI  - 7461414</code></pre>
<p>This would look similar in Endnote XML. Will we see these changes to BibTeX, RIS and Endnote XML in 2012? I don’t know, but I very much hope so. Imagine what your Zotero, Mendeley or Endnote could do if the application knew about unique author identifiers, e.g. find all papers by a particular author, alert me when a particular author publishes something new, or organize your reference library by author.</p>

</figure>
<p>The workshop started with product demos (18 demos in a little over three hours!), we then spent two half days working in smaller groups on one of the six topics above. I was assigned to the <strong><strong>#recognition</strong></strong> group, and we started with a very open discussion about recognition, reputation, altmetrics and related topics. The work was much more focussed on the second day, where we produced a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://msrworkshop.tumblr.com/tagged/recognition">draft text</a> with practical recommendations.</p>
<p>We all reported back to the whole group in the plenary discussion the second day, but unfortunately didn’t have much time (and energy) left to discuss the reports of the other topic groups in more detail. It was suggested that we create a Wikipedia page summarizing our reports, so that researchers interested in new scholarly communication tools would have a starting point.</p>
<p>I personally felt that most reports (including our own) had too much detail information – they are great resources of information, but are probably overwhelming for the average researcher. I therefore thought that a good alternative to a wiki page would be a Question &amp; Answer site similar to the hugely popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>. Even simpler would be a book in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/cookbooks.do">Cookbook</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://pragprog.com/book/fr_arr/advanced-rails-recipes">Recipes</a> format so popular with programmers. The book would be a collection of solutions for many of the small problems we face in scholarly communication today. We probably need hundreds of recipes, to start this off I today wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scholarly-communication-cookbook-create-a-researcher-profile-page/">recipe for creating a researcher profile page</a> (very much based on our topic report).</p>

<p>Reinventing Discovery, the book by Michael Nielsen we all have been waiting for, has finally been published on Friday. Today I flew to Boston for the Microsoft Research eScience Workshop: Transforming Scholarly Communication, and reading the book on the plane was the perfect preparation for the workshop.</p>
<p>Michael says in the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>I wrote this book with the goal of lightning an almighty fire under the scientific community. … We have an opportunity to change the way knowledge is constructed.</em></em>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9517.pdf">download the chapter 1 as PDF</a>, and you can also watch the videos of two of his recent presentations: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnWocYKqvhw">TEDx Waterloo</a> in March and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040623/http://river-valley.tv/keynote-solo2011/">Science Online London</a> in September.</p>
<p>The book uses examples from science and related disciplines – e.g. programming or chess – to examine both the opportunities and challenges of doing Open Science. The book is good reading, because Michael is aware of the many challenges that we face before science can be done differently. One example for this is the peer-reviewed journal article as the main currency to evaluate researchers. Until scientists are also rewarded for producing or curating data, programming scientific software, etc., we will not be able to start a new era of networked science.</p>
<p>Highly recommended reading.</p>
<p>Timo Hannay has also written a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nphys2109">review of the book</a> for Nature Physics, and I’m sure we will soon see many more.</p>

<p><em>If you have generated/collected data to be used as evidence in an academic publication, you should deposit them with a suitable data archive or repository as soon as you are able. If they do not provide you with a persistent identifier or URL for your data, encourage them to do so.</em></p>

<p><em><em>Give dataset identifiers in the form of a URL wherever possible, unless otherwise directed.</em></em></p>
<p><em><em>Include data citations alongside those for textual publications. Some reference management packages now include support for datasets, which should make this easier.</em></em></p>
<p><em><em>Cite datasets at the finest-grained level available that meets your need. If that is not fine enough, provide details of the subset of data you are using at the point in the text where you make the citation.</em></em></p>
<p><em><em>If a dataset exists in several versions, be sure to cite the exact version you used.</em></em></p>
<p><em><em>When you publish a paper that cites a dataset, notify the repository that holds the dataset, so it can add a link from that dataset to your paper.</em></em></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The shortDOI service was launched by the International DOI Foundation (IDF) in May 2010. The service creates short versions of the often long DOIs, e.g. <strong><strong>10/dvq</strong></strong> instead of <strong><strong>10.1093/hmg/ddp202</strong></strong> – written as URL this would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://doi.org/dvq">http://doi.org/dvq</a> instead of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddp202">http://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddp202</a>. shortDOIs started as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://labs.crossref.org/site/toi_dois.html">CrossRef Labs project</a> in 2009 and were originally named TOI DOI – TOI stands for tiny object identifier. For a good introduction I recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2010/05/long-handle-on-shortened-digital-object.html">Eric Hellman’s blog post</a> written in May 2010 when the shortDOI service was launched.</p>

</figure>
<p>shortDOIs provide exactly the same service as normal DOIs, i.e. they redirect the user to the digital resource. They are convenient, particularly for email and Twitter where space is limited. Links to journal articles created by URL shorteners such as bit.ly or goo.gl look similar, but require two redirects (first to dx.doi.org, then to the journal article). But URL shorteners provide additional services to users, e.g. customized links and usage statistics.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell shortDOIs have not become popular since the service started more than a year ago. One important reason is certainly that publishers are not really using them for their journal articles. I don’t think many users will go through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://shortdoi.org/">extra steps creating a shortDOI</a> just to use a DOI with Twitter – the Twitter URL shortener t.co will do this automatically for them. Michael Kuhn has created a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://blog.mckuhn.de/2011/02/bookmarklet-for-shortdoiorg.html">bookmarklet</a> that makes it a little bit easier to create shortDOIs. If we want shortDOIs to ever become popular, then we should ask journal publishers, bibliographic databases, reference managers and other places that currently use DOIs to enable them.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is using shortDOIs instead of DOIs, and is also using the shortDOI to link to individual articles on ScienceCard, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://sciencecard.org/articles/dvq">http://sciencecard.org/articles/dvq</a>. Yesterday I’ve created about 750 shortDOIs for ScienceCard, and  this probably already makes ScienceCard one of the larger shortDOI users. I will decide in the coming months whether shortDOIs have improved the ScienceCard service. A nice feature would for example be the announcement of newly published papers via Twitter.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a> announced an investment in startup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.labtiva.com/">Labtiva</a>. And Labtiva released a “community preview” of their reference manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.readcube.com/">ReadCube</a>. The community preview is a free download for Windows and Mac, and this is the summary of my first impressions.</p>
<p>You could write two different reviews about ReadCube. The first version would mention the really slick interface, and the fun you have using the program. ReadCube is doing a good job importing the PDFs on your hard drive and adding bibliographic information to them. In addition to PDF import you can also search PubMed and Google Scholar. ReadCube helps you find related papers by listing the references and citing papers of the paper you imported. ReaderCube also gives recommendations based on the papers in your library.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/10/readcube1-500x276.jpg" title="readcube" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>ReadCube includes an integrated PDF viewer that also allows text highlighting and note taking.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The community preview is free, so please download ReadCube to find out whether you like it.</p>
<p>The second review would take a different approach. It would ask what problem ReadCube tries to solve, and why researchers should start using ReadCube rather than the tools they already use, maybe for many years. ReadCube is a reference manager with a particular focus on organizing the PDFs of scholarly papers. There a number of programs out there that can do the same. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> for Macintosh for example is a very similar program, but the first version of it has been released four years ago. Even more traditional reference managers now include inline PDF readers with annotation support, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121628/http://www.endnote.com/enx5info.asp">latest version of Endnote</a>. Mendeley and Zotero are two other alternatives, and they are both free and available for Windows, Mac and Linux. It’s difficult to see what is unique in ReadCube, and on the other hand some important features are missing (e.g. no bookmarklet to import from other sources, no reference type other than journal articles, no group sharing feature, no integration with Microsoft Word). And ReadCube is based on Adobe Air, a cross-platform development environment that you either love or hate.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch what direction ReadCube development will take. They started a few years later than their competitors, and it will be a lot of work to catch up. I wish the Labtiva team good luck.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a> is a new service that I started last month with the simple idea to automatically track all journal articles of a given author, and to collect the article-level metrics (citations, bookmarks, etc.) for these papers. ScienceCard requires unique identifiers for articles and authors to work. Unique identifiers for authors is a difficult topic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/orcid/">regularly discussed</a> in this blog. But I thought that using digital object identifiers (DOI) for journal articles would be easy. The system managed by CrossRef was started 10 years ago, and almost all journal publishers now use DOIs – there were 49,350,542 registered CrossRef DOI links as of today.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/4632436148_7795a0127c.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="500" height="375" alt="Number buttons by fragmented on Flickr" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.flickr.com/photos/fragmented/4632436148/">Number buttons</a> by fragmented on Flickr</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first problem I encountered is that many bibliographic databases don’t fully support DOIs. Most of them store DOIs, but not all of them allow queries using DOIs, and very few services allow linking to them using DOIs. In the end I had to store various other article identifiers in ScienceCard (currently PubMed ID, PubMed Central ID, Microsoft Academic Search ID, Mendeley UUID, Scopus ID). One side effect of this proliferation of identifiers is that (in very rare cases) DOIs are not unique in these bibliographic services. And it makes it more complicated than necessary to build tools based on DOIs. The members of CrossRef are publishers, the other service providers (whether public or private) seem to be reluctant to fully support a service where they have no direct influence.</p>
<p>The second problem with DOIs is that they are often not web-friendly. DOIs are really permanent URLs, and CrossRef has recently changed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.crossref.org/help/Content/02_Getting_started/Displaying_DOIs_in_print_and_online.htm">display guidelines for DOIs</a> to reflect this. Instead of <strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057">doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057</a></strong></strong> we are supposed to show DOIs as <strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057</a></strong></strong>. The problem is that DOIs can contain characters such as “+”, “(“, “.” or “/” that need to be escaped when used as URLs. Some ScienceCard examples include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049(05)80357-0">http://doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049(05)80357-0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/12.4.357">http://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/12.4.357</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi980175+">http://doi.org/10.1021/bi980175+</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119%5B0088:SSCPEO%5D2.0.CO;2">http://doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0088:SSCPEO]2.0.CO;2</a></li>
</ol>
<p>These special characters can create problems when DOIs are used in software programs. ScienceCard for example wants to create links to articles in the format <strong><strong>http://sciencecard.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0088:SSCPEO]2.0.CO;2.xml</strong></strong>, but this function is currently broken.</p>
<p>One possible solution are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://shortdoi.org/">shortDOIs</a>. Article (3) would for example become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://doi.org/dcp">http://doi.org/dcp</a>, whereas article (4) is rejected as invalid DOI. I would love to use shortDOIs in ScienceCard and other places (e.g. Twitter), but haven’t found an API yet that automatically returns shortDOIs for DOIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/26/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">Component DOIs</a> directly link to a figure or table of a paper. This is an underused, but very useful feature, and is for example provided by the <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals. Unfortunately component DOIs can confuse bibliographic databases and make it more difficult to track all the links to a given article. I had to write a little routine to detect component DOIs imported into ScienceCard.</p>
<p>Articles are sometimes updated or corrected, and many publishers will use a different DOI for the updated article. This is a problem when you want to track all references to this particular article. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020121">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020121</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020181">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020181</a> are for example DOIs for the same <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> article (the latter is the corrected version). <em><em>Nature Precedings</em></em> uses a format that is easier to understand for computers - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npre.2011.4479.3">http://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2011.4479.3</a> is for example a link to the third version of this particular manuscript. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/index.html">CrossMark</a> is a new CrossRef service that will make it easier to track the different versions of a manuscript, including retractions.</p>
<p>ScienceCard should of course not be limited to journal articles. I’m also interested in other scholarly content, e.g. preprints from <strong><strong>ArXiV</strong></strong> or research datasets from <strong><strong>DataCite</strong></strong>. But I want to first solve the problems with DOIs for journal articles, before I tackle the much bigger problems with uniquely identifying and tracking other scholarly contributions. Science blog posts are a good example. It would be wonderful to track them in ScienceCard, but I don’t see how we can do that before we have a system in place that assigns unique and persistent identifiers to blog posts. For this and other reasons I really want unique identifiers for science blog posts, and we should also think about using DOIs for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Update October 9</strong></strong>: A ScienceCard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://sciencecard.org/articles/804">example</a> of multiple identifiers for the same paper:</p>

In the past few years we finally started to have the technology to do article-level metrics (citations, downloads, etc.) and PLoS has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">pushed this concept</a> since at least 2009. I first heard about the PLoS Article-Level Metrics project in a presentation given by Pete Binfield in July 2009, and a month later I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/08/15/plos_one_interview_with_peter_binfield/">interviewed him</a> about this project.</p>
<p>Article-level metrics are a major step forward from journal-level metrics, but I always wanted to extend this concept to authors. Three events in the past few weeks worked nicely together and made me start an author-level metrics project myself: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://dev.mendeley.com/api-binary-battle">programming contest by Mendeley and PLoS</a> with a September 30 deadline, a hackfest following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> in early September, and two conferences (in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://irisc-workshop.org/irisc2011-helsinki/">Helsinki</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://www.orcid.org/civicrm/event/info?id=2&amp;reset=1">Geneva</a>) in mid-September discussing the value of unique author identifiers for researchers.</p>

</figure>
<p>I’ve taken the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">Open Source Article-Level Metrics API Server</a> from PLoS and added a few important features: metrics by author, additional metrics from Mendeley and Microsoft Academic Search, and a web-based interface that less authors register via their Twitter account. The result is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</a>, a website I launched this weekend and today entered for the Mendeley/PLoS Binary Battle contest. ScienceCard currently uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">Microsoft Academic Search</a> to find all papers of a particular author, the next version will allow users to retrieve info about their personal papers from Mendeley.</p>
<p>Working on ScienceCard has already taught me a lot about the problems we face when doing metrics for scholarly works. Most problems are social and not technical. Digital object identifiers (DOIs) for example have been the standard identifier for journal articles for ten years, but many places (including PubMed, Microsoft Academic Search and Mendeley) want users to use their own identifiers for journal articles. This makes it unnecessarily difficult to find articles and collect metrics. Identifiers for authors are even more complicated. ScienceCard will of course use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140041/http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> identifiers when they become available in 2012, and I hope that I can make the transition to ORCID easier for ScienceCard users.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London 2011 Conference</a> was a great event that took place last Friday and Saturday. I was able to celebrate the first <em><em>PLoS Blogs</em></em> anniversary together with community manager <strong><strong>Brian Mossop</strong></strong>, but a detailed conference post will follow later. The blog posts covering the event are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/coverage">here</a>, and the list is growing by the hour.</p>
<p>On Sunday a few brave souls met at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> offices for the Science Online London hackathon to spend some time on a cool programming project. We were greeted by <strong><strong>Victor Henning</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Jason Hoyt</strong></strong> and quickly came up with a few good ideas. Jason finished work on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://twendeley.ologeez.org/">Twendeley</a>, a cool Twitter/Mendeley mashup that looks for papers mentioned in your Twitter stream and finds relevant articles in Mendeley. I wanted to do some work on the PLoS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">Article-Level Metrics API</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article-Level Metrics</a> looks at the usage and reach of an individual article instead of using the <strong><strong>Journal Impact Factor</strong></strong> as a proxy for the impact of a paper. The PLoS Article-Level Metrics API provides access to some interesting numbers: not only citations, HTML pageviews and PDF downloads, but also social metrics such as number of bookmarks in CiteULike or number of readers in Mendeley.</p>
<p>But for the hackathon I was not interested in building a tool that talks to the Article-Metrics API. On Sunday morning I had discovered that the PLoS Article-Level Metrics server software is not only available as Open Source software, but is built with <strong><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong></strong>, a programming framework that I’m familiar with. So I thought it would be fun to start improving the software by adding metrics on the author level. And by building your own Article-Level Metrics server, you are not limited to papers published in PLoS journals, or to the kinds of metrics provided by PLoS. Wouldn’t it for example be nice to also include download counts for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a> datasets?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/09/alm2-500x355.png" title="alm2" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>With the help of <strong><strong>Kristi Holmes</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></strong> we quickly got the API server up and running, added a few papers and retrieved citation counts from PubMed Central and the number of bookmarks from CiteULike (see above). A few hours later we could add authors, and today I was able to automatically import the first papers by author.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/09/alm-500x274.png" title="alm" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>For author-level metrics we of course need a widely used unique author identifier, and an API we can talk to. Otherwise author disambiguation quickly becomes frustrating. Until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> comes along next year, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/mas/thread/9a23b2d6-6599-4853-acf5-c1692a64365e">Microsoft Academic Search API</a> looks like one of the best ways to retrieve DOIs for papers published by a particular author.</p>
<p>The code for this project is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://github.com/mfenner/plos-alt-metrics">Github</a>. This obviously needs a lot more work, but it shouldn’t take more than a few months to have the author part working properly and to find a host for a server. And because this is an API server based on the PLoS code, all tools that interact with the PLoS Article-Metrics server can use this system immediately.</p>
<p>This service should make it a little bit easier to build a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1417">professional trading card for scientists</a>, or a dashboard of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://total-impact.org/">total impact</a> of your research.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> later this week I will moderate a session on <strong><strong>microattribution</strong></strong>, together with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://www.mikepeel.net/blog/">Mike Peel</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/">Bora Zivkovic</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/gigablog/">Scott Edmunds</a>. I thought that microattribution would be an established concept, so I was surprised to find so little information about it. Wikipedia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microattribution&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">doesn’t know</a> about microattribution. A search in PubMed retrieves only two hits (the 2011 <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em> paper mentioned below and an editorial in the same issue). One of the first mentions of the term appears to be an August 2007 Editorial in <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em> (<strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng0807-931">Compete, collaborate, compel</a></strong></strong>), but at the time the term also included what we today would call data citation. It therefore might be a good idea to try a definition:</p>
<blockquote>
Microattribution ascribes a small scholarly contribution to a particular author.
</blockquote>
<p>Important for this definition is the <strong><strong>small scholarly contribution</strong></strong>, which until now we have been unable to appropriately associate with its contributor. This scholarly contribution is too small to merit a scholarly paper or publication as dataset. And in most cases we have not bothered to provide unique identifiers for the scholarly contribution and/or the author.</p>
<p>A very good example for where microattribution can be valuable is the description of genetic variation. A March 2011 <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em> paper (<strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.785">Systematic documentation and analysis of human genetic variation in hemoglobinopathies using the microattribution approach</a>)</strong></strong> concluded that microattribution <em><em>demonstrably increased the reporting of human variants, leading to a comprehensive online resource for systematically describing human genetic variation</em></em>. One example described in the paper is the genetic variation in the promoter of the KLF1 erythroid transcription factor, explaining differences in the level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Most of these variants were never published in a paper (the blue squares in the figure).</p>

</figure>
<p>For the first time we now seem to have both the technology and willingness to enable microattributions on a large scale. There will be ample time for discussion in the microattribution session on Friday, but I’m personally most interested in the next practical steps to move microattribution forward. My background is unique author identifiers (ORCID) and my co-moderators bring in their experience with Wikipedia (Mike Peel), science blog aggregation (Bora Zivkovic) and crowdsourcing of sequencing efforts (Scott Edmunds). Some of the questions that I would like to address in the session are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should all microattribution information be collected in one, several or many places?</li>
<li>Do we need one, several or many identifier schemes for contributions and authors?</li>
<li>What level of detail should we allow for microattributions?</li>
<li>Should microattributions use persistent identifiers?</li>
<li>Can and should we keep our scholarly contributions separate from other contributions?</li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p><em><em>My simplified view of the scholarly record, updated</em></em></p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/">have said before</a> that I think that attribution should be separated from evaluation, and I think is also true for microattribution. The main reason is that evaluation is something we still know very little about, and a scholarly record available to everybody will make it much easier to make progress here. I don’t think anybody knows yet what distinguishes a good from a bad microattribution, or whether it is possible to compare the scientific impact of 10 or 100 microattributions to one scholarly paper.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first beta of the reference manager Zotero 3.0 was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525045252/http://www.zotero.org/blog/announcing-zotero-3-0-beta-release/">released</a> yesterday. The big news is that Zotero 3.0 no longer only runs within the Firefox browser, but is now also available as a standalone version similar to other reference managers.</p>

<p>Zotero does not support Internet Explorer. Users of this blog are not representative of all internet users, and Zotero 3.0 would offer browser support for more than 80% of them.</p>

<p>Zotero 3.0 is beta software and you should expect bugs. One small problem I discovered is that the German translation is incomplete, e.g. in the menus. But overall Zotero looks and feels very similar to the familiar Zotero 2.1 – just as a standalone version. One new feature I like is duplicate detection, an experimental feature of earlier versions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I discovered (via a tweet by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/https://twitter.com/#!/ostephens">Owen Stephens</a>) a very interesting document <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names">Personal names around the world</a> that discusses the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
How do people’s names differ around the world, and what are the implications of those differences on the design of forms, databases, ontologies, etc. for the Web?
</blockquote>
<p>The document was written by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://rishida.net/">Richard Ishida</a>, Internationalization Activity Lead at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://www.w3.org/International/">W3C</a> (World Wide Web Consortium). The document was published on July 26, and Richard was seeking comments until August 7 before finalizing the document.</p>
<p>The document is a good summary how names for people differ around the world, e.g. multiple family names (Spain, Latin America), no family name (Iceland), different ordering of names (China, Korea, Japan), non-latin characters in names (many countries), and other issues.</p>
<p>The second part of the document makes a few suggestions of how these variations in names could be handled on the web. The text should be required reading for anybody who is designing databases that handle international names – and there are a lot of them. A form that asks for <strong><strong>first name</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>middle initial</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>last name</strong></strong> will just not be appropriate for a lot of people.</p>

<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/noname.jpeg" title="noname" class="kg-image" width="500" height="500" alt="Flickr photo by Giant Gingko." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em><em>Flickr photo by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133741/http://www.flickr.com/photos/giantginkgo/37740313/">Giant Gingko</a>.</em></em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I am lucky that my German name doesn’t contain any German umlauts (ä, ö, ü) or the letter ß, so I haven’t had any bad (or funny) experiences with my name. But I know that it can be a big problem for a lot of people. The result is that people end up having several spellings for their name, or write their name in ways that were not intended, e.g. a hyphen between the two family names in Spain. The name is something very personal, and I think the least we can do is to allow people to use their name appropriately.</p>
<p>Science is probably no better or worse in this regard than other domains. If we are lucky, we find a journal that prints our name correctly, or have a database that understands that ü should be sorted as ue. But for the most part, this seems to be an unresolved issue. And I don’t want everybody to start using a first name and last name in that order and only with ASCII or latin characters. That would be boring. So please start thinking about this issue when you design systems that use personal names, and use the W3C document by Richard Ishida as a starting point.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In July Wiley published the book <strong><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111645/http://book.flowingdata.com/">Visualize This – The Flowing Data Guide to Design, Visualization and Statistics</a></strong></strong>. The book is written by <em><em>Nathan Yau</em></em>, and he is of course also behind the popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111645/http://flowingdata.com/">FlowingData</a> blog about the same topic. This is a short review of the book.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/visualize-this-drop.png" title="Visualize This" class="kg-image" width="304" height="383" />
</figure>
<p>Please keep in mind that I’m no expert in data visualization. The book is written for people like me, an expert in the topic will probably look at the book differently.</p>
<p>And the book is intended as an introduction to important concepts. It is probably the wrong book if you are interested in using a particular tool – e.g. Adobe Illustrator, R or Flash – for Data Visualization.</p>
<p>The examples in the book are about topics similar to those used in the FlowingData blog, most of them are about data journalism. This is not a book about visualization of scientific experiments.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the book talks about how to tell stories with data. This is a very important chapter, as learning how to tell a good story is more important than knowing all the details on how to use a tool for visualization.</p>
<p>Nathan continues with a chapter on how to find and format data for data visualization. We are then introduced to a number of important visualization tools, and their particular strengths. Nathan uses a large number of tools in the book, but seems to particularly like Python for formatting data, R for for calculation and visualization, and Adobe Illustrator for perfecting the result for publication. This is one of the take-home messages of the book for me: instead of perfecting the use of one particular tool, learn to decide what works best for a particular problem. R and Illustrator are a good start for most problems.</p>
<p>The next few chapters look at visualizations in different contexts: patterns over time, proportions, relationships, differences and spatial relationships. All chapters are written with examples that you can follow along, and with enough basic information that you can start solving similar problems on your own. Below is a chart I tried myself after reading the book. It looks at the number of member organizations of the non-profit ORCID over time (more info <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111645/http://www.orcid.org/news/250-participating-organizations-have-joined-orcid">here</a>).</p>

<p>I can highly recommend <strong><strong>Visualize This</strong></strong> to anybody interested in learning about data visualization. I found only two things I didn’t like. I wish Nathan had spent more time explaining how a data graph can be improved visually. In many examples he shows how small changes in color or font size can make a big difference in presentation, but I would prefer to see a more systematic approach to this important topic. I wouldn’t mind if he would drop the chapter on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face">Chernoff faces</a> instead – fun stuff, but not really important in an introductory text.</p>
<p>My other problem is with the publisher. I read the book as ePub on my iPad. It is nice to have web links you can click in the text, but it would have been even nicer if the ePub had ben prepared with a little bit more care. Most images in the text (there are many) are too small – in an ePub you expect figures to enlarge and show more detail when you click on them. And figure headings were regularly orphaned (on a different page than the figure itself). ePub is an evolving standard, but a little bit of consideration for typography and layout would go a long way.</p>

<p>Mendeley has changed reference management in many ways. Most importantly it has added another choice for users, and their constant push for new features has benefitted everybody, including the competition.</p>
<p>The Mendeley software has been downloaded one million times and 100 million papers have been uploaded to the service. Mendeley is no longer the new kid on the blog. With their popularity and size also comes an increased responsibility for the community. On top of my wish list: a decent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041606/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">Citation Style</a> Editor that would also benefit <strong><strong>Zotero</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Papers 2</strong></strong> users (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041606/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/research-tutorials/howto-edit-citation-styles-for-use-in-mendeley/">hacking the XML files</a> is not an option for most people).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week Google Scholar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://googlescholar.blogspot.com/2011/07/google-scholar-citations.html">announced a new feature</a> on the Google Scholar Blog: <strong><strong>Google Scholar Citations</strong></strong>. The stated purpose of this tool is to allow researchers to calculate their citation metrics, e.g. their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2007/08/17/do_you_know_your_hirsch_number/">Hirsch index</a> (H-index).</p>

</figure>
<p>This is an interesting new service, that not only helps with calculating citation metrics, but also shows you who is citing your papers – a great discovery tool. Signup to Google Scholar Citations is currently limited, but I was able to create a profile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N05QljgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</p>
<p>The problem? We have this service already. <strong><strong>Scopus</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Researcher ID</strong></strong> and others have provided this information for some time, and Google Scholar Citations looks very much like a response to the recently launched Microsoft Academic Search:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/SafariSnapshot002-500x349.jpeg" title="SafariSnapshot002" class="kg-image" width="500" height="349" />
</figure>
<p>Will we soon see a similar offering from <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>ResearchGate</strong></strong>? There is of course nothing wrong with competition, and there is no reason why we can’t have more than one place that provides researcher profiles. But as I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/">argued before</a>,</p>
<p><strong><strong>Systems that measure and evaluate scientific contributions can and should be separate from the databases that hold the scholarly record.</strong></strong></p>
<p>It is not only a waste of resources (both Google Scholar’s and the individual researchers’ who maintain their profiles) to many many different bibliographic databases, but it also makes it impossible to compare citation metrics. In the examples above Alonzo Church has a H-index of 19 at Google Scholar, but only 11 at Microsoft Academic Search (and probably again a different one somewhere else). This means that we can only use an H-index when we mention where (and when) it was calculated.</p>
<p>The better solution is a common <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://3lib.org/">open bibliography</a>, and the difference between the various service would be how they calculate the citation metric or present the bibliographic data – you can see the different approaches taken by Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search in the screenshots above. This is a difficult task, but not impossible to do. The first step would be to realize that having a common open bibliography would create tremendous value for everybody as we can start building tools on top this bibliography without requiring to collect all the bibliographic data ourselves. We see something like this happening in smaller domains, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/04/29/web-tools-for-searching-the-biomedical-literature-part-i/">tools using the PubMed database</a> are a good example.</p>
<p>From a researcher perspective it makes little sense to have many different places where you can maintain your publications. It makes much more sense to do this once and then see the information reused in different services. This is the approach the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID initiative is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610140256/http://www.orcid.org/principles">taking</a>:</p>
<p><strong><strong>All profile data contributed to ORCID by researchers or claimed by them will be available in standard formats for free download (subject to the researchers’ own privacy settings) that is updated once a year and released under the CC0 waiver.</strong></strong></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Other blog posts often provide important background material for your own posts, and they are typically cited by <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">inline links</a> in the text. But sometimes we need more formal citations, e.g. when citing blog posts in a journal article or when providing a bibliography. But how do you properly cite a blog post?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4534468843_176c790812.jpg" class="kg-image" />

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.apastyle.org/">APA Style</a> – from the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association – suggests the following format:</p>
<p><strong>Fenner, M.H.</strong> (2011, January 23). Beyond the PDF … is ePub [Web log post]. Retrieved from <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a></p>
<p>This is a good start, but I think the citation should include the name of the blog. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Chicago Manual of Style</a> does this:</p>
<p><strong>Fenner, M.H.,</strong> “Beyond the PDF … is ePub,” Gobbledygook, January 23, 2011, <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.library.illinois.edu/learn/tutorials/mla.html">MLA Style</a> also mentions the Publisher, and the date the blog post was accessed (in addition to the publication date):</p>
<p><strong>Fenner, M.H.</strong> “Beyond the PDF … is ePub”. <em>Gobbledygook</em>. PLoS Blogs. January 23, 2011. Web. July 21, 2011. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a></p>
<p>This is a little bit too much for me. There is an argument to use the accession date for web content, but having two dates can be confusing and the publication date is more important. I personally prefer a citation format that looks very similar to a journal article citation (and comes closest to the Chicago Manual of Style):</p>
<p><strong>Fenner, M.H.</strong> Beyond the PDF … is ePub. <em>Gobbledygook</em>, January 23, 2011. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub</a></p>
<p>If we want to include blog posts in a reference list, we also have to think about the formatting. In <strong>BibTeX</strong>a blog entry would look like this:</p>
<p>@misc{ author = {Fenner, Martin}, title = {Beyond the PDF … is ePub}, journal = {Gobbledygook}, type = {Blog}, number = {January 23}, year = {2011}, howpublished = {\url{https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/}}</p>
<p><strong>BibTeX</strong> doesn’t have an entry type for blog posts, so we have to use @misc and use the type field. @unpublished is an alternative, but that is a strange name. We have to put the URL into the howpublished field, which is also awkward.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp">RIS</a> is another popular format, and knows about blogs and URLs:</p>
<pre><code>TY  - BLOG 
AU  - Fenner, Martin 
TI  - Beyond the PDF … is ePub 
JF  - Gobbledygook 
PY  - 2011/01/23 
UR  - https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/ 
ER  -</code></pre>
<p><strong>BibTeX</strong> and <strong>RIS</strong> both predate the web. A modern reference format should use HTML or XML so that it can be embedded directly in the blog post. The recently announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/06/07/schema-org-for-scholarly-html/">Schema.org</a> micro data format is a strong candidate for this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>, and it has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://schema.org/BlogPosting">BlogPosting</a> format:</p>
<p>&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"&gt; &lt;span itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"&gt; &lt;span itemprop="name"&gt;Fenner, Martin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span itemprop="name"&gt;Beyond the PDF … is ePub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span itemprop="publisher"&gt;Gobbledygook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;time datetime="2011-01-23"&gt;01/23/11&lt;/time&gt; &lt;a href="<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/</a>" itemprop="url"&gt;<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/</a>&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>There are other ways to describe this blog post with <strong>Schema.org</strong>, but the best practices are still evolving. How this BlogPosting above looks in a blog obviously depends on the CSS styling used, without any styling it looks like this:</p>
<p>Fenner, Martin<br />
Beyond the PDF … is ePub<br />
Gobbledygook<br />
01/23/11<br />
<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/">https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/beyond-the-pdf-is-epub/</a></p>
<p>With a little work on the CSS for this blog, the citation could look exactly as shown above, but with added semantic information that is understood by search engines and other tools. It is clear to me that HTML-based standards such as Schema.org are the future for embedding citation information in blog posts. We need better tools to make this process as painless as possible.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brendan Thomas has published an interesting paper that looks at author email addresses in the PubMed database of biomedical literature. Email addresses of first authors have been added to PubMed since 1996, and they can be retrieved via the standard web interface or automated software. This makes PubMed an excellent place to find the email address of an academic author, but also shows that PubMed is very vulnerable to email address harvesting.</p>
<p>The problem is not limited to PubMed; this is also an issue with many scholarly journals. Email addresses are used as contact information in scholarly papers, and they are commonly displayed on journal webpages. You can harvest email addresses from <em><em>NEJM</em></em>, <em><em>Science</em></em> or <em><em>PLoS</em></em> webpages, and you don’t even need a subscription. <em><em>JAMA</em></em> is hiding the email address, and <em><em>Nature</em></em> is providing an author contact form. Both journals provide the email address in the PDF.</p>
<p>Most journals provide the postal address of corresponding authors. Journals added email addresses in the 1990s, and this of course has become the preferred method of communication among scientists – when was the last time you received a postcard for a reprint request? Unfortunately we have long learned that it is no longer safe to make email addresses publicly available – more than 90% of email traffic is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043917/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/spam/">spam</a>.</p>
<p>Journal publishers have to rethink their policies regarding contact information of their authors. And authors should demand from journals that their email addresses are treated with more respect for privacy. There are better ways to provide contact information for corresponding authors, and I don’t mean a link to their Twitter account or LinkedIn profile. Journal publishers should create author profile pages that not only list all publications of a particular author, but also the relevant contact information. There should be contact forms instead of plain email addresses, and authors should be able to control what information is displayed in their author profile. Author profiles of course can be further extended in many ways, from links to publications with other publishers to author-level metrics.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blogging is a <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/conference_blogging_interview_with_alex_knoll/">great format</a> to report from conferences. The regular blog format works best for posts written at the end of the day – unless you are typing really fast. Microblogging, i.e. a number of short or very short posts by a group of people, works better for live blogging of an event and has become very popular.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100409/http://www.friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> was probably the first widely used microblogging tool for scientific conferences starting in 2008, and a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">January 2009 paper</a> describes the experience at 2008 ISMB conference in Toronto. By late 2009 Twitter had surpassed FriendFeed in popularity, and at some point in 2010 most people seemed to have switched from FriendFeed to Twitter for conference microblogging.</p>
<p>Twitter is a great tool in many ways, but is far from perfect for conferences. The biggest problem is that the tweets about a particular topic aren’t really connected. Hashtags help to find tweets about a particular conference, but hashtags for a particular session have never cught on. This makes it very difficult to have a real discussion, or to find related messages later on.</p>
<p>Facebook is not only extremely popular, but has also taken many of the features of FriendFeed. But for some reason it has not become a popular conference microblogging tool for scientists. I think this is because many people use Facebook primarily for their social interactions, and keep those separate from their professional discussions.</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> was released last week, and the services has many of the features of FriendFeed and Facebook (who bought FriendFeed in August 2009, one of the reasons the service has never become that popular). Google+ allows discussions around a particular message (post, tweet?). It doesn’t have groups about a particular topic (e.g. conference), and doesn’t yet understand a concept similar to hashtags. The service looks very nice from a desktop computer, but the mobile version for iPhone and iPad isn’t very polished (I haven’t tested the Android app).</p>
<p>The experience from Twitter tells me that the most important feature for a great conference microblogging tool is popularity, and this is only partly related to the technology behind the service. There are already a good number of science bloggers and other Science 2.0 folks on Google+ and we have seen some good discussions (e.g. a <a href="https://plus.google.com/106537123721037364937/posts/buxDWrvq8vU#106537123721037364937/posts/buxDWrvq8vU">discussion about conference microblogging</a>), so that is a very good sign. But the experience with Google Wave (<a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/what_comes_after_google_wave/">discontinued</a>) and Google Buzz (not that many people seem to use it) makes me a bit cautious, and I will wait how Google+ evolves in the coming months before I get too exited.</p>
<p>Update: Added a paragraph about Facebook.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week the first <a href="http://annotum.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/alpha-release/">Alpha</a> version of <strong><strong>Annotum</strong></strong> was released. <a href="http://annotum.wordpress.com/about/">Annotum</a> is “a scholarly authoring and publishing platform based on WordPress”. I <a href="http://river-valley.tv/annotem-an-open-source-journal-authoring-and-publishing-platform-based-on-wordpress/">first learned</a> about Annotum at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop in January. One of the themes of the workshop was that we need better tools for authoring, reviewing and publishing of scholarly articles. For many at the workshop it was obvious that these tools should be web-based, use HTML as the file format, and should use readily available tools whenever possible.</p>
<p>WordPress is a perfect candidate for such a tool, but needs to be extended with functions required for scholarly articles: better handling of citations, figures and tables, support of standard document formats such as <a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM-DTD</a>, and support of  a review workflow with co-authors, editors and reviewers. WordPress can easily be extended with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092155/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">plugins</a>, and a good number of plugins have been released for scholars. A good starting point are plugins tagged <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/res-comms">res-comms</a> and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wordpress-for-scientists">WordPress for Scientists</a> Google Group.</p>
<p>There is one problem with these scholarly plugins: none of them offers a complete solution, and it is sometimes tricky to make them work with other required plugins or with each other (a particular problem are plugins that use Javascript). This means that there is currently no out-of-the-box solution to create, review and publish scholarly content with WordPress.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Annotum</strong></strong> is an ambitious project that wants to change this. It helps that Annotum seems to have sufficient funding and commitment to launch a production version later this year – rather than being the part-time effort of a single developer. Technically it is a WordPress theme, and not a plugin. Themes normally are responsible for the look of a WordPress site, but they can also contain functions normally found in plugins. Installing a single theme is much easier for the average WordPress user than installing a number of plugins plus a theme that works with all plugins. BTW, themes can have child themes, so this doesn’t mean that all Annotum sites will look the same.</p>
<p>Annotum of course can’t do everything by itself and has to work with existing plugins (it took me only one hour to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092155/http://blogs.xartrials.org/annotum/article/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications/">make it work</a> with my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092155/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">ePub Export</a> plugin). Annotum’s Carl Leubsdorf is part of the WordPress for Scientists community and I think he will make sure that Annotum will work well with the plugins already out there.</p>
<p>I hope that Annotum will not only become a nice out-of-the-box solution to create a WordPress-based journal or science blog, but will also be a big stimulus for the budding community of scholarly WordPress users and developers.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three leading funding organizations today made this important <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2011/WTVM051897.htm">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust announced today that they are to support a new, top-tier, open access journal for biomedical and life sciences research.
</blockquote>
<p>Some features of the new journal:</p>
<ul>
<li>open access</li>
<li>name of journal to be decided</li>
<li>aims to attract and define the very best research publications</li>
<li>papers will be accepted or rejected as rapidly as possible</li>
<li>first issue expected for summer of 2012</li>
<li>editor-in-chief and editorial team will be active scientists</li>
<li>journal will enable improved data presentation</li>
<li>long-term business model to be developed, the three organisations made a commitment to cover initial costs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an important announcement, as the journal has the potential to have a major impact on publishing biomedical research. Two aspects of the announcement surprise me: many details about the new journal have not been decided, I would have expected at least a decision about the journal name and Editor-in-Chief. And from the few details in the announcement the new journal appears to take a fairly conservative approach to publishing. You could for example compare today’s press release with the editorial explaining the launch of PLoS Biology from October 2003 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036">Why PLoS became a Publisher</a>). This approach is understandable as most scientists are conservative and don’t care much about new publishing technologies or even open access; they only care about having their research accepted in a journal with high impact. Publishing this kind of journal – which usually means high rejection rates and time-consuming editorial work – is difficult with with an author-pays business model. The deep pockets of the three funding organizations change this equation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we saw the the announcements of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/06/new-journal-nature-one-launched-today/">Scientific Reports</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.d1190">BMJ Open</a> and similar high volume open access journals that follow the success of PLoS ONE (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://www.slideshare.net/PBinfield/ssp-presentation4">PLoS ONE and the Rise of the Open Access Mega Journal</a>). The new journal announced today takes a very different approach to open access publishing.</p>
<p>This announcement has of course also been discussed elsewhere, including:</p>
<ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the month Google, Bing and Yahoo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/06/07/schema-org-for-scholarly-html/">announced</a> schema.org, a new initiative for structured markup on the web. Richard MacManus responded with a critical piece at ReadWriteWeb (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/is_schemaorg_really_a_google_land_grab.php">Is Schema.org really a Google Land Grab?</a>), mainly criticizing that the initiative didn’t use RDFa and didn’t seem to have consulted with the web standards body W3C. The best discussion about schema.org that I found so far (via Eric Hellman’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2011/06/our-metadata-overlords-and-that.html">post</a>) is by Henri Sivonen (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://hsivonen.iki.fi/schema-org-and-communities/">Schema.org and Pre-Existing Communities</a>). He explains why he thinks it makes sense that schema.org picked microdata over RDFa or microformats as markup standard. And he discusses how the web community has developed standards in the past and what characterizes the successful efforts. I personally believe that schema.org will bring us closer to the semantic web, and the discussion reminds me a little bit of the discussion around HTML 5 vs. XHTML 2 (where the pragmatic solution supported by the major browser vendors won over the ideal but dogmatic solution discussed for many years in standards bodies). Schema.org is will certainly be discussed at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/start">Science Online London Conference</a> in September.</p>
<p>Whether schema.org becomes a success depends in large part on the adoption by the community. Schema.org is backed by the three largest search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo), so everybody who wants to be found by them will take a close look at the standard. Scholarly content is for the most part collected and curated in specialized databases. This makes it not only a technical decision whether or not to adopt schema.org for markup (we need more and better defined scholarly data types in the standard), but also a business decision. If scholarly publishers start marking up their journal articles, they will be easier to find via Google, Bing, etc. But will this mean that institutions would start re-evaluating their subscriptions to commercial services like Scopus or Web of Science? And will schema.org help or hinder the very large market of discovery tools for scholarly content?</p>
<p>At this point this is very much a theoretical discussion. We first need better scholarly data types in the schema.org standard. The Association of Educational Publishers and Creative Commons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041721/http://www.aepweb.org/mediacenter/AEP-CC-Schema_6-7-11.htm">has announced</a> an initiative to create a metadata framework for educational resources based on schema.org. And we hopefully see a similar initiative from scholarly publishers. I hope that the group behind schema.org is open to this input.</p>

<p>We have recently posted a first draft of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.html">conference program</a>, and you can see that we are trying something new. In addition to the keynotes, panel discussions and breakout sessions we had the last few years we have also scheduled four workshops for the second day of the conference. I’m doing a workshop called <strong><strong>Beyond scholarly publication</strong></strong> together with <em><em>Eva Amsen</em></em> (The Node) and <em><em>Mark Hahnel</em></em> (FigShare). The idea is to really have a hands-on experience, and in this workshop we will focus on blogs and related tools. We will try to do something interesting both for someone who wants to start a science blog, but also for more experienced writers (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">ePub</a>). We haven’t work out the details, so please drop us a note if there is a particular topic that you want to see covered. All workshops will focus on <strong><strong>Spinal Muscular Atrophy</strong></strong> as a theme, and we hope that everybody has learned a few tricks by the end of the day.</p>
<p>We are still looking for breakout session suggestions for the first day of the conference. If you have a good idea, please add it to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/">wiki</a>, as we hope to have a program that is (close to) final by July.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday the search engines Google, Bing and Yahoo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html">announced</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, a new initiative for structured data markup on the web. Websites that use this schema to markup their data (more than 100 data types are supported) will make it easier for the three largest web search engines to find their content. Schema.org uses microdata, not microformats or RDFa, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/docs/faq.html#15">FAQ</a> this was a pragmatic decision.</p>

</figure>
<p>Schema.org also defines the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">ScholarlyArticle</a>, but unfortunately this data type doesn’t add any properties beyond those of the parent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/Article">Article</a> (e.g. the Digital Object Identifier). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://www.schema.org/Person">Person</a> data type is also interesting (and uses a professor as an example), but for example doesn’t include an <strong><strong>isAuthor</strong></strong> relationship.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether future versions of the schema.org standard will have better support for scholarly content, and how well this microformat can be integrated into our efforts to create <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>. And how quickly scholarly publishers and other providers of scholarly content will adopt this new standard., which in its current form already is a big improvement over plain HTML.</p>
<p><em>Update (6/7/11): Google today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/06/authorship-markup-and-web-search.html">announced</a> support for authorship markup, either via the schema.org format or using the <strong><strong>rel</strong></strong> attribute.</em></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ten days ago I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/04/29/web-tools-for-searching-the-biomedical-literature-part-i/">mentioned</a> a paper by Zhiyong Lu that gives an overview over the available web tools to search the biomedical literature. Most of these tools enhance the PubMed service, and Zhiyong Lu in fact works for the NCBI, the developer of PubMed. In this post I want to take a more detailed look at the available tools.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/05/pubmed-500x177.png" title="pubmed" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>A good starting point is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/search/">companion webpage</a> to the paper, listing 28 services. One of the most painful shortcomings of PubMed is the sorting of results by date. Zhiyong lists 8 tools that can present search results sorted by relevance. Semantic search, seeking relevant concepts, and visualization of search results are all offered by several tools. Three tools will identify similar publications, and three tools will find potential experts, reviewers or collaborators. It is a good sign that there are so many tools that integrate with PubMed – in addition to the reference managers (e.g. Endnote, Papers) that do the same.</p>
<p>The analysis has one important shortcoming: only tools that specifically cover the biomedical literature are discussed. General purpose search tools such as <strong><strong>Web of Science</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Scopus</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Google Scholar</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>Microsoft Academic Search</strong></strong> are therefore not covered, neither are online bibliographic tools such as <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>CiteULike</strong></strong>. All of them also include biomedical literature – although the coverage at the fairly new Microsoft Academic Search is still limited. They all offer unique features not found in Pubmed or the 28 tools discussed in the paper.</p>
<p>When I think about how I find interesting articles, then it is increasingly through my social networks - including this paper by Zhiyong Lu. His paper unfortunatel fails to discuss this important search strategy. Twitter, FriendFeed, science blogs, etc. are strange places to find interesting literature, but they work for me. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://www.massgenomics.org/2011/04/whole-genome-sequencing-for-cancer-patients.html">This April 22 post</a> on the wonderful <strong><strong>Massgenomics</strong></strong> blog alerted me to two interesting papers published in JAMA on April 20 that describe the use of whole-genome sequencing in the care of two patients with acute leukemia. I presented the paper by Welch et al. in a journal club last Friday and we had a very interesting discussion.</p>
<p>The paper has also been discussed in the following places: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://nnlm.gov/pnr/dragonfly/2011/02/15/beyondpubmed/">Dragonfly</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://cmch.typepad.com/cmch/2011/03/res.html">Center on Media and Child Health</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://beckerinfo.net/scp/2011/04/29/pubmed-and-beyond-a-survey-of-web-tools-for-searching-biomedical-literature/">Bernard Becker Medical Library</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/3rd-call-for-submissions-for-medical-information-matters-tools-for-searching-the-biomedical-literature/">Medical Information Matters</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://autoimmunbuch.de/?p=447">Friendly Fire</a> (German), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://usalbiomedica.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/pubmed-and-beyond-a-survey-of-web-tools-for-searching-biomedical-literature/">Usalbiomedica</a> (Spanish).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zhiyong Lu recently published an excellent overview of the web tools that are currently available to search the biomedical literature. The article has also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610131235/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/search/">companion web page</a> that allows user to filter for the features they are interested in, and to report new tools.</p>
<p>The author describes 28 tools developed specifically for the biomedical domain. The tools are grouped based on their most important features into</p>
<ol>
<li>Ranking search results</li>
<li>Clustering results into topics</li>
<li>Extracting and displaying semantics and relations</li>
<li>Improving search interface and retrieval experience</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhiyong Lu works for the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). NCBI developed and maintains PubMed, and this is obviously the database to which the other tools are compared. Or looked at this differently, the proliferation of tools in the four areas listed above is an indication of the areas where PubMed is not very good at (e.g. it returns search results not by relevance, but in chronological order).</p>
<p>Instead of reviewing the article, I decided to do this in two parts. I will write about my thoughts on the various tools next week to give everybody time to look at this themselves. This is my delayed contribution to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610131235/http://blogcarnival.com/bc/cprof_6092.html">medlib’s round</a> blog carnival. Feel free to write a comment, or submit directly to the blog carnival using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610131235/http://blogcarnival.com/bc/cprof_6092.html">this link</a>. The post with my own thoughts and the feedback I have received will go up Saturday next week.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The recent tragic events in Japan have made it difficult or impossible for many Japanese scientists to continue their work. The newly launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://nipponsciencesupport.net/">Nippon Science Support Network</a> has therefore established a database of positions and stipends in other countries for Japanese students, research fellows and scientific personnel. The network has started as a cooperation between German and Japanese researchers, but because of overwhelming demand today turned into a global initiative, allowing researchers from all countries help to support Japanese scientists.</p>
<p>Behind this initiative are a lot of people, but most importantly Phil Selenko – a group leader from the Leibniz Institute of Molecular Pharmacology in Berlin. Longtime readers of this blog will remember that Phil helped organize a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/05/24/why-local-hubs-in-nature-network-are-important">great effort in 2008</a> to bring Nobel Laureates and other senior scientists together with graduate students, and <em><em>to give them the same kind of networking opportunities that are usually restricted to seasoned faculty (and often happens behind closed doors).</em></em> I wish him the best of luck with this initiative.</p>

<p>Linking to component DOIs is straightforward, table 1 of the paper above is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122411/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.t001">10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.t001</a>.

And this becomes an even more important issue once DOIs for datasets are more commonly cited.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The history of HTML begins 1989 at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</a>, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva. <strong><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Robert Cailliau</strong></strong> and colleagues invented HTML (as well as the transport protocol HTTP and the web browser) to facilitate collaboration between CERN physicists.</p>

</figure>
<p>HTML was originally invented for scholarly communication, but of course by the mid-1990s was also used by everybody else. But when electronic distribution of scholarly journal articles became possible, most publishers switched to PDF instead of HTML as the electronic document format of choice.</p>
<p>In April 2003 Inera, Mulberry Technologies and the NCBI published the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite</a> (NLM-DTD, read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://old.diglib.org/preserve/hadtdfs.pdf">here</a> about the history of this DTD Suite). The NLM-DTD has become the de facto XML standard for scholarly publishing and archiving. Although some tools for authors can write articles in this format (including Microsoft Word with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/">Article Authoring Add-In</a>), the NLM-DTD has never caught on as an authoring format for scholars and I’m not aware of any publisher accepting manuscripts written in this format.</p>
<p>In April 2009  <em><em>Learned Publishing</em></em> published a paper by <strong><strong>David Shotton</strong></strong> titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/2009202">Semantic publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal publishing</a>. David listed six rules for semantic publishers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start simply and improve functionality incrementally.</li>
<li>Expect greater things of your authors.</li>
<li>Exploit your existing in-house skills fully.</li>
<li>Use established standards wherever possible.</li>
<li>Publish raw datasets to the Web.</li>
<li>Release article metadata, particularly reference lists, in machine-readable form.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the paper focusses on scholarly publishers, these rules also very much apply to what we could call Scholarly HTML today.</p>
<p>At about the same time (March 31, 2009) <strong><strong>Peter Sefton</strong></strong> for the first time used the term <em><em>Scholarly HTML</em></em> in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">blog post</a>. He thinks that Scholarly HTML should allow the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Documents should definitely have headings.</li>
<li>Protocols for representing things like examples.</li>
<li>Metadata, using a linked data approach.</li>
<li>Links from terms mentioned in the text to ontologies that describe them.</li>
<li>Linkable paragraphs.</li>
<li>Dead simple reference management via links to trusted sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>In January 2011 <strong><strong>Phil Bourne</strong></strong> organized the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop, and I was lucky to attend. We had a number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://river-valley.tv/conferences/beyondthepdf-2011">interesting sessions</a> about how to improve the current scholarly paper published as PDF. I was involved in the working group thinking about better authoring tools, and one of my personal conclusions was that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">ePub</a> is a very interesting alternative to PDF if we need a packing format for HTML, e.g. for journal submission or archiving.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Peter Murray-Rust</strong></strong> was able to capture the ideas of the authoring working group with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/02/09/scholarly-html-hackfest-cambridge-uk-march/">drawing</a>, and he picked the term <em><em>Scholarly HTML</em></em> as the best description of what we want to achieve. He subsequently invited Peter Sefton, Brian McMahon and me (and a number of other people interested in Scholarly HTML) to a workshop that took place last weekend in Cambridge. Some of the thoughts of Peter Murray-Rust and Peter Sefton are summarized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/14/scholarly-html-%e2%80%93-major-progress/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://ptsefton.com/2011/03/18/scholarly-html-fraglets-of-progress.htm">here</a>. Two outcomes of the workshop are Scholarly HTML <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-principles">Principles</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-faqs">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>My approach to Scholarly HTML is through developing WordPress plugins. The future will hopefully bring of a number of Scholarly HTML authoring tools, and WordPress will be just one of them. But Wordpress is a great platform to test ideas and improve them over time, or to quote David Shotton: <em><em>start simply and improve functionality incrementally</em></em>. One starting point has been citations in Scholarly HTML and we have already made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-citations">good progress</a>.</p>
<p>The idea behind Scholarly HTML is not to build alternatives for Microsoft Word or LaTeX for authoring, but instead to build tools that will allow us to do something new and exciting with scholarly content. The trick here is to improve the scholarly document – and the author should see the immediate benefit - without putting too much extra burden on the author. And this might in fact be the big challenge for Scholarly HTML.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The best and quickest discussions of a scientific paper now sometimes happen in science blogs rather than in the peer-reviewed literature. Whereas we have a number of scholarly databases that track citations between papers, we don’t have the same tools for science blogs. Following all science blogs manually has simply become impossible (unless your first name is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://coturnix.org/">Bora</a>). This makes it difficult to find all blog posts about a particular paper  - either for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/08/27/supplementary_information_should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/">proper discussion</a> of an article or for doing automated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/15/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">article-level metrics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h3>
<p>Aggregation can help solve this problem. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://www.researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging</a> aggregates blog posts about peer-reviewed research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://scienceseeker.org/">ScienceSeeker</a> aggregates all science blog posts (currently aggregating over 400 blogs) and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/">announced</a> in February. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature Blogs</a> also aggregates science blogs, but doesn’t seem to be up-to-date.</p>
<h3 id="microformats">Microformats</h3>
<p>Microformats are an alternative – but of course complimentary – strategy. Microformats are small snippets of HTML that represent commonly published things. A good example is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license">Rel-License</a>, a microformat indicating licensed content:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot; rel=&quot;license&quot;&gt;cc by 2.0&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In February Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/2011/02/24/google-launches-microformat-powered-recipe-search">launched</a> a new Recipe view feature based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/wiki/hrecipe">hRecipe</a> microformat, demonstrating how microformats can help discovering content.

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/1/S1/S6/table/T1">more than 20</a> CiTO tags for describing what we think about a particular paper or science blog post – many science bloggers would probably have used <em><em>cito:critiques</em></em> for the above paper. I suggest <em><em>cito:discusses</em></em> as the standard CiTO relationship for most papers and blog posts.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The reference management software <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> has been a regular topic on this blog. I wrote about Papers in one of my first blog posts in May 2008, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/03/interview_with_alexander_griekspoor/">interviewed</a> main developer Alex Griekspoor in October 2008, and held a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/19/papers_for_iphone_released_time_for_more_poetry/">poetry contest</a> when Papers for iPhone was released in February 2009 (Stephen Curry won the first price for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/19/papers_for_iphone_released_time_for_more_poetry/#comment-898">this poem</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>Today Papers 2 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://news.mekentosj.com/">was released</a>, and with this major update Papers has grown into a full-fledged reference manager for the Macintosh (there is no Windows or Linux version). Papers 1 was released in 2007 as a tool to manage the PDF files of scholarly papers on your hard drive. Papers 1 did this job very well, but it was not a reference manager in the strict sense, because you couldn’t use Papers to insert citations into the manuscripts you were writing.</p>
<p>In order to add this feature, Papers first had to be completely rewritten to not only handle journal articles and the associated PDF files, but also all the other common reference formats – conference proceeding, book chapter, website, etc. A nice side effect that I haven’t fully explored yet is that Papers can now also store all your Powerpoint or Keynote presentations (but fulltext search in these presentations doesn’t seem to work yet).</p>
<p>Inserting references into manuscripts is done using a floating window activated from the menu bar or with a shortcut:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/papers2-500x475.jpeg" title="papers2" class="kg-image" width="500" height="475" />
</figure>
<p>This feature works similar to the plugins used by Endnote, Mendeley, Zotero, etc., but in typical Papers fashion the implementation is much nicer. The plugin is available to all applications, e.g. other word processors besides Microsoft Word, your blogging software or your email program.</p>
<p>The other big limitation of Papers 1 wasn’t so obvious when Papers originally launched in 2007. But today most major reference managers allow users to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/reference-manager-overview/">share their references</a> in private and/or public groups, as most research is done in groups and most manuscripts are written by multiple authors.</p>
<p>The sharing feature of Papers 2 is called <strong><strong>Livfe</strong></strong>. It is not as complete as the sharing features of some other reference managers (e.g. CiteULike or Mendeley). It is for example not yet possible to upload a complete Papers library to Livfe. And Livfe doesn’t have a web interface, but only works through Papers.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044214im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/03/Papers-2a-500x243.jpg" title="Papers 2a" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>The difference between Papers 2 and other reference managers is not so much the feature set. What sets Papers really apart is the love that went into the design of the program. Papers doesn’t just get the job done, it allows you to have fun searching for references or reading – and now also writing – a paper. This makes Papers 2 a strong competitor against some of the other established programs that for example have more than 25 years of experience with reference management (Endnote), think that reference management should be done as Open Source software (Zotero), do everything in the browser (Refworks), or see reference management primarily as a social application (Mendeley).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The bibliography of a scholarly paper is interesting and important reading material. You can see whether the authors have cited the relevant literature, and you often find references to interesting papers you didn’t know about. Bibliographies are obviously also needed to count citations, and then do all kinds of useful and not so useful things with them.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/5124103273_968a3c50cc.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="319" height="500" alt="Bibliography by quinn.anya at Flickr." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em><em>Bibliography by quinn.anya at Flickr.</em></em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unfortunately almost all bibliographies are in the wrong format. What you want is at least a direct link to the cited work using the DOI (if available), and a lot of journals do that. You don’t want to have a link to PubMed using the PubMed ID as the only option (as in PubMed Central), as this requires a few more mouse clicks to get to the full-text article. And you don’t want to go to an extra page, then use a link to search the PubMed database, and then use a few more mouse clicks to get to the full-text article (something that could happen to you with a PLoS journal).</p>
<p>A bibliography should really be made available in a downloadable format such as BibTeX. Unfortunately journal publishers – including Open Access publishers – in most cases don’t see that they can provide a lot of value here without too much extra work. One of the few publishers offering this service is BioMed Central – feel free to mention other journals that do the same in the comments.</p>
<p>This weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/04/scholarly-html-hackfest-and-visit-of-peter-sefton-and-martin-fenner/">Peter Murray-Rust invited Peter Sefton and me to Cambridge</a> (UK) for a very interesting workshop about <strong><strong>Scholarly HTML</strong></strong>. Our goal is to discuss how we can define standards and build tools to make HTML the best platform for scholars and scholarly works. The event is in fact a hackfest, and we hope to have something to show by Sunday evening.</p>
<p>My idea for the hackfest is a tool that extracts all links (references and weblinks) out of a HTML document (or URL) and creates a bibliography. The generated bibliography should be both in HTML (using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">Citation Style Language</a> ) and BibTex formats, and should ideally also support the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/14/how-to-use-citation-typing-ontology-cito-in-your-blog-posts/">CiTO</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a> -  a standard to embed bibliographic metadata in HTML. I will use PHP as a programming language and will try to build both a generic tool and something that can work as a WordPress plugin. Obviously I will not start from scratch, but will reuse several already existing libraries. Any feedback or help for this project is much appreciated.</p>
<p>If I had a tool with which I could create my own bibliographies (and in the formats I want), I would no longer care so much about journals not offering this service. One big problem would still persist, and that is that most subscription journals wouldn’t allow the redistribution of the bibliographies to their papers. A single citation can’t have a copyright, but a compilation of citations can. I’m sure we will also discuss this topic at the workshop, as Peter Murray-Rust is one of the biggest proponents of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://openbiblio.net/principles/">Open Bibliographic Data</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the annoyances with bibliographies as we use them for scholarly papers is that is usually unclear why a particular paper was cited. It is often possible for readers to gather this information by looking at the citation in the context of the surrounding text, but this is very difficult to automate. A highly cited paper might contain a method that everybody uses, might be a review, or it might contain information that everybody disagrees with. David Shotton has thought a lot about this problem and has come up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-1480-1-S1-S6">CiTO</a>, the Citation Typing Ontology:</p>
<blockquote>
CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology for describing the nature of reference citations in scientific research articles and other scholarly works, both to other such publications and also to Web information resources, and for publishing these descriptions on the Semantic Web.
</blockquote>
<p>Using CiTO obviously means extra work for the author, so for widespread use it is very important that CiTO is as easy to use as possible. The first step would be to reduce the number of possible relationships to a manageable number, e.g. not more than ten (CiTO defines more than 20 relationships). Following a dinner discussion at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop, David Shotton kindly provided 10 popular CiTO relationships to Alex Wade from Microsoft Research and me. I made three little changes to the list: added “cites” as the default generic relationship, dropped “shares authors with”, as this can be done better with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">unique author identifiers</a>, and added “disagrees with” to have at least one relationship that expresses disagreement.</p>
<p>In the next step I added these relationships to my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/11/having-fun-with-citations-at-scienceonline2011/">Link to Link</a> WordPress plugin, and I released the updated version (1.1) today. Using CiTO is an option that can be turned off, but the plugin makes it very easy to use CiTO relationships when inserting references into a blog post:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/12th/cito-500x433.jpeg" title="cito" class="kg-image" width="500" height="433" />
</figure>
<p>The CiTO relationship is stored in the <strong><strong>rel</strong></strong> attribute of the link that is created – currently as free-form text, but this can be changed to the <strong><strong>cito:DisagreesWith</strong></strong> format. This information can easily be extracted by computers, or made available in the bibliography to readers. The Reference Manager CiteULike is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093455/http://opencitations.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/use-of-cito-in-citeulike/">also supporting CiTO</a>, but we need many more CiTO tools for authors.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ePub is a great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">format for scholarly content</a>, and there are a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/01/epub-wordpress-plugin-released-today/">number of tools</a> to create ePub files. But creating content is only half the story, at least as important is an easy mechanism for distribution. This is particularly true if your ePub files are not books, but shorter pieces of content: journal articles, blog posts or even output from your ongoing research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> or the related Atom protocol has of course become the standard mechanism to publish frequently updated works.</p>
<p>Open Publication Syndication System (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://code.google.com/p/openpub/wiki/CatalogSpecDraft#Introduction">OPDS</a>) is a syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom. OPDS is a relatively new format, but is supported by a growing number of (book) publishers, ePub tools and readers. If you want to try OPDS for yourself, pick one the feeds listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://code.google.com/p/openpub/wiki/AvailableFeeds">here</a> and add the feed as a Book source in the Stanza reader (in the <strong><strong>Shared</strong></strong> section). Alternatively, install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://www.epubread.com/de/manual.php">EPUBReader plugin</a> for Firefox. As you can see, OPDS does more than just list titles with a summary and image, you can also categorize the content by author (or tag), and provide a search interface.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/02/OPDS-500x371.jpg" title="OPDS" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>I’m looking forward to the first scholarly publisher that not only provides ePub files of his journal articles, but also makes them available via OPDS. Although OPDS is currently used mostly for electronic books, I think that this is a very interesting protocol for scholarly publishers. Did I mention that OPDS also provides facilities for buying or lending content? And that you probably shouldn’t expect OPDS support in the Apple iBooks application for iPhone and iPad anytime soon as they don’t seem to like distributed content delivery? I would like to see scholarly publishers providing their journal content via ePub and OPDS that can be consumed with one of the many available readers, rather than everybody creating his own little app that only works with a single publisher on a single platform.</p>
<p>OPDS is a relatively simple protocol and similar to RSS should make it easy for everybody to provide his content in catalog form. It should be straightforward to add OPDS support to the WordPress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">ePub plugin</a> that I released last week, thus making a blog (or blog network) available directly in the ePub reader. While I expect that we will continue to read most blogs via the Web or RSS reader, ePub might be the better format for longer posts and the posts you want to store on your computer.</p>
<p>ePub is a very interesting format for packaging research objects, e.g. the description and data files from an experiment. OPDS would be very helpful as a distribution mechanism for these ePubs, and also works on the small scale of a research group. You can for example use the Calibre eBook management tool – which can create not only ePub files but also OPDS catalogs – together with Dropbox to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://dearauthor.com/wordpress/2010/02/14/create-your-own-cloud-of-ebooks-with-calibre-calibre-opds-dropbox/">share your content</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Calibre2opds">calibre2opds</a> tool also creates an OPDS catalog from the Calibre metadata database but doesn’t require Calibre to run in order to use the OPDS catalog. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611043846/http://www.pincette.biz/index.xhtml">Pincette</a> document management system automatically creates an OPDS catalog for the ePub files dropped into a Pincette folder. I hope that more tools for researchers start to support not only ePub but also OPDS. An OPDS interface to the data produced by your favorite piece of lab equipment (gel documentation system, microarray reader, etc.) would be an interesting sight.</p>

</ul>
<p>WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, and many science bloggers (including us here at PLoS Blogs) use WordPress. And science bloggers have some specific requirements, e.g. easy to use tools for linking to scholarly papers or aggregators of blog posts about a particular paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging</a>) or science blogging in general (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/">ScienceSeeker</a>). A number of people use WordPress as a lab notebook (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettinger</a>). There is no clear difference between WordPress as a scholarly writing tool and WordPress as a blogging tool, and I expect that the amount of scholarly writing done with WordPress will only increase.</p>
<p>Two days ago Ed Yong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/02/02/research-into-reprogrammed-stem-cells-an-interactive-timeline/">published an interactive timeline</a> of research into reprogrammed stem cells. John Rennie yesterday cited Ed Yong and this post as a wonderful example of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/02/03/why-ed-yong-is-the-future-of-science-news-and-you-could-be-too/">future of science news</a>. The future of science news depends on many things (not least brilliant writers such as Ed and John), but I think we also need better tools to make science writing fun and exciting.</p>
<p>In the hope that this will improve WordPress as a science writing platform, Mark Hahnel from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.science3point0.com/">Science 3.0</a> blogging network and me today created the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/wordpress-for-scientists">WordPress for Scientists</a> Google Group. We invite developers who are working on scholarly plugins and themes for WordPress to join this group, but also researchers that need specific WordPress tools (e.g. to hook up their lab equiment to WordPress), and science bloggers that have cool ideas on how to improve WordPress for their needs.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop took place a little over a week ago. One take-home message for me was that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub">ePub is a very interesting</a> document format for scholarly publishing and has several advantages over PDF. The workshop had a wonderful spirit <em><em>to do something</em></em>, and in this spirit I wrote a WordPress plugin that automatically creates ePub files from blog posts. The plugin was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export">released today</a>, and can be installed directly from your WordPress installation. A sample ePub can be downloaded from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2011/01/09/embedding-adobe-illustrator-charts-in-wordpress-using-html5/">this blog post</a>, using the link at the bottom.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is version 1.0 of the plugin, and there a still number of small bugs, mainly because ePub is a complex format. A big problem is page breaks, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">widows and orphans</a> can currently only be avoided by workarounds. You can also see in the screenshot that the shortcode wasn’t parsed for the ePub.</p>
<p>But these are minor issues that can be solved in the coming weeks. More interesting for version 1.1 is the inclusion of attachments (other than images) in the ePub. I have to do some more thinking on how to do this, especially how to handle all the possible mime types.</p>
<p>I like reading science blogs in ePub format, using either Adobe Digital Editions on the Mac or iBooks on iPad and iPhone. This works particularly well for longer posts, e.g. those lovely posts from my science writer colleagues here on PLoS Blogs. If you have access to WordPress, then this plugin is one of the easiest ways to produce content in ePub format.</p>

        <updated>1970-01-15T23:57:07.200Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today nature.com released their iPad reader application. The app gives users access to<em><em> Nature News</em></em> and abstracts from <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Medicine</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Biotechnology</em></em>,...]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today nature.com <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/ipad.html">released</a> their iPad reader application. The app gives users access to <em><em>Nature News</em></em> and abstracts from <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Medicine</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Biotechnology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Physics</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Reviews Microbiology, Nature Reviews Genetics</em></em> and <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em>. Full text access to these journals can be purchased for $69.99 per year (<em><em>Nature</em></em> costs $79.99 per year with free access to full-text articles until February 28).</p>
<p>The iPad app is in many ways similar to the nature.com iPhone app <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/nature_com_iphone_app_in_pictures/">released last February</a>, but takes advantage of the larger screen. A <em><em>Nature News</em></em> article looks like this on the website:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0038-500x375.jpg" title="IMG_0038" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>… and like this in the nature.com reader:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0037-500x375.jpg" title="IMG_0037" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Much nicer. The <strong><strong>Add to Connotea</strong></strong> button is interesting. Connotea is a social bookmarking service by nature.com, but less popular than CiteULike and Mendeley. So why is there no choice?</p>
<p>The home screen lists all sources and articles. Users can search nature.com, PubMed and arXiv, but the latter two sources are hidden behind the <strong><strong>Advanced</strong></strong> button (in the upper right corner).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0039-500x375.jpg" title="IMG_0039" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>The saved searches and bookmarks are stored on nature.com and can be shared with the website and iPhone app. The home screen doesn’t follow iPad conventions – the sources don’t appear in a floating window when holding the iPad vertical. Journals can be added here:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0040-500x375.jpg" title="IMG_0040" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Journal articles look similar to <em><em>Nature News</em></em>. References open in a popup window:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0042-500x375.jpg" title="IMG_0042" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Figures open not in a popup, but in a separate window, and they can be resized. It is unfortunately not possible to scroll through the figures of a paper.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0041-500x375.jpg" title="IMG_0041" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>The nature.com reader doesn’t reflow content when you hold the iPad vertically, just shows less white margin on both sides. Author names are not links, and for some content the app switches to web browser mode.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0043-375x500.jpg" title="IMG_0043" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Reading papers on the iPad is much more fun than on the iPhone. And it was a smart move <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html">to use ePub</a> for these mobile apps instead of PDF, I think that ePub <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">has a bright future</a> for scholarly content. This is version 1.0, I’m sure future versions will do further improve the reading experience thanks to HTML5. The prices for a personal subscription sounds reasonable, especially for the weekly <em><em>Nature</em></em>.</p>
<p>I have one problem with the application: the papers I read are not all published by Nature Publishing Group. I would very much prefer an ePub reader for all journal content, similar to the iPad PDF readers <strong><strong>Sente</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Mendeley</strong></strong>. We already have several ePub readers for the iPad (e.g. Stanza and iBooks), but we need more journal publishers that offer their content in this format. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html">press release last February</a> hinted that Nature Publishing Group will provide content in ePub format for other e-readers. Subscription journals such as the <em><em>Nature</em></em> journals have another problem, they want to charge the iPad user for reading content. This makes it more difficult for them than for open access publishers to distribute content in innovative ways, and that is probably one reason the nature.com iPad app is a closed system that can’t import, export or print articles.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having breakfast at the end of a conference is a good way to recap what was discussed and can help to generate new ideas. Two years ago at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://scienceonline09.com/">ScienceOnline09</a> a conversation with Cameron Neylon that followed up on the session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2801/version/1/html">Reputation, authority and incentives. Or: How to get rid of the Impact Factor</a> (moderated by Björn Brembs and Pete Binfield) was started my interest in unique author identifiers for researchers. An <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/nterview_with_geoffrey_bilder/">interview with Geoff Bilder</a> about author identifiers and the CrossRef Contributor ID project followed a month later – still one of my favorite blog posts. I have since become deeply involved with author identifiers and have joined the Board of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) initiative last September.</p>

<p>Wednesday to Friday I attended the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop in San Diego to discuss how we can do better in scholarly publishing. The limitations of the PDF format were just one topic, the main themes were annotation, data, provenance, new models, writing and reviewing and impact. This is my presentation:</p>
<p>We had two very productive breakout sessions about writing and reading tools, and we agreed that we should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/home/program-draft/notes-from-the-breakout">build something that makes it much easier to describe and distribute our research data</a>. Most people in the group took a very pragmatic approach and want to build simple tools appropriate for small research groups in the next few months. We thought that graduate students would be good early adopters, and we already have three principal investigators willing to test these tools in their labs.</p>

</figure>
<p>Peter Sefton demonstrated his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://fascinator-demo.com/portal/default/search">Fascinator</a> tool that already has a lot of the required functionality. But it was the breakfast discussion before departing – again with Cameron Neylon, but this time also including Peter Murray Rust, Peter Sefton and Ana Nelson – that helped me to put all my thoughts into place.</p>
<blockquote>
ePub should become the standard document format for authoring, distributing and reading scholarly content.
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.idpf.org/">ePub format</a> uses a collection of files held together in a zip archive. Content is displayed using a combination of XHTML and CSS – not different from web pages – and the ePub can also contain other files. Journal publishers use XML internally, and it is therefore easy to distribute journal articles in ePub format – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">some of them</a> are already doing this routinely. ePub has several advantages over PDF, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>ePub can be used for all steps in the creation of a scholarly document, including data collection, authoring, annotating and peer review. There is no need for time-consuming and expensive format conversions. Currently most manuscripts are submitted in Microsoft Word or LateX formats, and then converted first to XML and then to HTML and PDF. Metadata such as author identifiers, digital object identifiers and semantic information can be added early on and don’t get lost in a format conversion.</li>
<li>ePub makes it easy to include supplementary material, e.g. video and other multimedia content, the datasets used in the publication (particularly the data used for tables and figures), all cited references in BibTeX format, etc.</li>
<li>ePub is much better suited for reading on mobile devices, as the format allows reflowing of content. Most articles today are printed from the PDF and then read, but this behavior is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/">rapidly changing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>ePub is relatively new, and not many applications for scientists already support this format. We want lab equipment that stores its data in ePub, lab notebooks that write all files from an experiment into an ePub file, reference managers that store and display papers in ePub format, authoring tools that import all these ePub files and thus make it much easier to write, annotate and submit a manuscript, and journal submission systems that take ePub files. I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/28/wordpress-for-reference-management/">written a lot about WordPress</a> recently and this is of course a platform that would play nicely with ePub. At least two WordPress plugins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/epub">support ePub</a>, and it should be possible to modify them to the requirements of the scholarly paper.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/epub-500x199.jpg" title="epub" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Almost as important as the document format is the distribution mechanism of these ePub files. We need a system that makes it easy to collaborate on a document, and that includes version control. The simplest solution would of course be centralized and web-based, but I’m not sure that this is a realistic scenario. We talked a lot about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> during the meeting, but a solution using git (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/https://github.com/">github</a>), Amazon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Simple Storage Service</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive">Windows Live SkyDrive</a> or the repository software ePrints or DSpace is also possible. As an ePub document can contain all required documents, the submission of a manuscript to a journal or institutional repository could become as simple as uploading a single file, and all the peer review (including reviewer comments and revisions) could be done with that file. Submissions of datasets to databases such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://datadryad.org/about">Dryad</a> could of course also be done using ePub files. A versioned distribution system should also make it easier to automatically get information about corrections or retractions (e.g. using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://www.crossref.org/crossmark.html">CrossMark</a> system that will launch in 2011), and to receive regular updates of article-level metrics, including new citations of the article or dataset.</p>
<p>Several of us attending the meeting will continue the discussion in the coming weeks, and I hope I can convince them of the advantages of ePub. It shouldn’t take us more than a month or two to produce a nice ePub of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140912/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000976">sample PLoS Computational Biology article</a> provided for the Beyond the PDF workshop. The next <strong><strong>Science Online London Conference</strong></strong> will be September 2-3 at the British Library. This is a good opportunity to discuss the progress of this project, ideally including reports about new ePub tools for scientists, more journals using ePub for their articles, and practical feedback from the first users.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.org/whatisdc.html">DataCite</a> is an international consortium for data citation.

<p>Since 2005 the TIB was providing digital object identifiers (DOIs) to research datasets. In December 2009 research libraries and technical information centres from 6 countries founded the DataCite initiative. In December 2010 DataCite reach an important milestone by registering the 1,000,000th DOI name.</p>
<p>Many people are familiar with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> which is providing DOIs for research papers. CrossRef is operated by Publishers International Linking Association (PILA), a non-profit organization formed by scholarly publishers in 2000. Think of DataCite as the counterpart that is providing DOIs for research data. And as research data are typically stored in data centers associated with technical information centers  - e.g. the British Library or the  Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI) - and large research libraries (e.g. California Digital Library), DataCite members come from the academic community.</p>
<p>The TIB is located in Hannover, just a few miles away from Hannover Medical School where I work. In December I sat down with Jan Brase from the TIB, one of the driving forces behind DataCite and on its Board of Directors. We talked not only about DataCite, but also how DataCite could interoperate with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>, the unique author identifier initiative (where I am a member of the Board). One of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.orcid.org/principles">aims</a> of ORCID is to create a <em><em>permanent, clear and unambiguous record of scholarly communication,</em></em> and this of course includes not only publications, but also the contribution of research datasets. Gudmundur Thorisson gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">nice presentation</a> about the possible integration of DataCite and ORCID in September.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Jan presented about DataCite at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.ape2011.eu/">Academic Publishing in Europe</a> conference in Berlin. His slides are available on SlideShare, the video of his talk (like all the other presentations) will soon be available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://river-valley.tv/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also this week Jan started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.wordpress.com/">DataCite blog</a>. In his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/some-more-details-on-2011/">first post</a> (after the obligatory welcome post) Jan talks about the plans DataCite has for 2011. I am particularly excited about the central metadata repository that should be up and running by June. DataCite has allowed Thomson Reuters to crawl the repository so that the metadata will also appear in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science/">Web of Science</a>. A lot of interesting stuff is going to happen in 2011 around unique identifiers for researchers and their scholarly works.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://scienceonline2011.com/">ScienceOnline2011</a>, the fifth annual international meeting on Science and the Web, is only two days away. I am very excited for many reasons, most importantly because it gives me the chance to meet many online friends in person – again or for the first time.</p>
<p>On Saturday I will help moderate two (related) sessions: <strong><strong>How is the Web changing the way we identify scientific impact</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Having fun with citations</strong></strong>. The first session will be about alternative ways to measure scientific impact, and about the alternative types of publications we can measure. The second session is all about citations. We use them all the time in scholarly communications, but we don’t really think about them. To give a couple of examples: why are there so many different citation styles, why is it so difficult to find open bibliographic data, how can we describe why we decided to cite something, or how can we cite things that are not publications?</p>
<p>Since I suggested this session a few months ago, my thinking about citations has changed. Citations should be easy to use, wherever we need them. Even though he have a number of clever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/reference-manager-overview/">reference management tools</a>, the process is still too complicated. What would really help is an easier format for references, and the best format I can think of is the ubiquitous internet link. I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/11/citations-are-links-so-where-is-the-problem/">written about links</a> before, and I have spent the last few weeks to work on WordPress plugins to better handle links for scholarly works. Today I released the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-to-link/">Link to Link</a> plugin:</p>

</figure>
<p>The Link to Link window in the WordPress editor should look familiar to users of traditional reference managers. You search for references and then insert them into the text. The references are stored in the WordPress Links Manager, and you can get them in there using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611072611/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/">BibTeX Importer</a> plugin I wrote two weeks ago. Both plugins are available from the WordPress plugins directory and can be installed directly from WordPress.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s very unusual for me to post two blog posts in a single day, and even more so when both posts are based on press releases by the same organization. But this is important news for everybody interested in scholarly publishing.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html">press release</a> earlier today, the Nature Publishing Group announced a new journal that</p>
<ul>
<li>is covering biology, chemistry, earth sciences and physics,</li>
<li>is an open access journal, giving the authors the choice of two Creative Commons non-commercial licenses,</li>
<li>will publish all papers that are judged to be technically valid and original, and</li>
<li>uses article-level metrics to put the emphasis on the individual article rather than the journal as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new journal is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html"><em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em></a>, and obviously resembles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.plosone.org/"><em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em></a> in many ways, down to the article-processing charges which are $1350 for both journals (but will go up to $1700 for <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> in 2012). The journal is open for submissions and will publish the first papers this summer. With <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> (also see my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/11/26/nature_communications_interview_with_lesley_anson/">interview</a> with Chief Editor Lesley Anson) and <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> the Nature Publishing Group now publishes three journals covering all areas of the natural sciences.</p>
<p>The launch of <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> is a good sign that <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> is doing something right. It will be interesting to watch whether the two journals will only be competitive – they are aiming for the same manuscript submissions – or will also collaborate on projects such as article-level metrics.</p>
<blockquote>
“Scholarly communication has always, will always, and should always be served by a mix of models.”
</blockquote>
<p>In another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/statement.html">press release</a> today, David Hoole explains the position of the Nature Publishing Group on open access publishing. He argues that journals such as <em><em>Nature</em></em> with a 90% rejection rates are better served by a subscription model, and that he feels that journal submission fees (as discussed in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">recent report</a>) are not an attractive option. The press release also mentions that 40% of the content of the hybrid journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">Nature Communications</a> is currently open access.</p>
<p>Although I can follow the arguments made in the press release, I disagree that we need different “tiers” of journals. The <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> FAQ makes it clear that the journal doesn’t expect authors to submit their best works, but rather papers that require “speed of publication”, promise “no conceptual advance in the field” and show “negative results”. Let’s see how authors will respond to this and whether it will be possible 10 years from now to distinguish papers published in <em><em>Nature,</em></em> <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> and <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Articles published in <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Biotechnology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Cell Biology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Medicine</em></em> or <em><em>Nature Chemical Biology</em></em> are now available for renting from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.deepdyve.com/nature">DeepDyve</a>. Downloading or printing is not possible, and the $3.99 rental is for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Later this month, Nature plans to release the nature.com reader for the iPad. Monthy access to Nature (again read-only) will cost $9.99. For more information see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/rental.html">yesterday’s press release</a>.</p>
<p>In the discussion of subscriptions vs. author-pays for scholarly papers we sometimes forget that it’s really a question of how much we are willing to pay. I’m looking forward to the nature.com app for the iPad, and $9.99 per month seems reasonable. I would not rent a single article for $3.99 – this should either be $0.99 or give me the PDF that I can download and print, something that subscription journals typically charge $10-$30.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 1990 Tim Berners-Lee and others started HTML and the world wide web to facilitate scientific communications at CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory.</p>

</figure>
<p>Although the world wide web profoundly changed scholarly publishing (and of course many other things), HTML did not become the standard document format for scientific papers. In fact, there is no standard document format. We have document formats for authors, for the internal workflow of publishers, and for the distribution and reading of papers.</p>
<p>There are of course many good reasons to use LaTeX for writing, XML for workflows, PDF to print papers or ePub for mobile devices. But reformatting a manuscript into different formats several times is both expensive (in terms of time and costs) and means that the formatting options used will be a compromise of what is available in all formats.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/5327592909_f00585d28e.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="500" height="350" />
</figure>
<p>All this would be much easier if we just used HTML. With HTML, authors, publishers and readers can all use the same document format. And they will have an endless number of tools at their hands, including of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611084546/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/05/blogging-beyond-the-pdf/">WordPress</a> for writing and the web browser of choice for reading. HTML in 2010 is very different from HTML in 1990. HTML5 supports new semantic elements such as &lt;article&gt;, microdata, embedding of video without plugins, geolocation, and offline web applications.</p>
<p>An HTML-based scholarly publishing workflow will make it</p>
<ul>
<li>faster and cheaper to publish a paper,</li>
<li>easier to create rich interactive documents,</li>
<li>easier to add additional steps, such as integration of data from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611084546/http://www.axiope.com/">lab notebooks</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611084546/http://www.arxiv.org/">publishing of pre-prints</a>, etc.</li>
<li>easier to integrate additional services, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611084546/http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/vignettes/googleVis.pdf">data visualization</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611084546/http://languageediting.nature.com/editing-services">language editing</a>.</li>

Unique identifiers for scholarly authors are still not commonly used, but provide a number of benefits to authors, institutions, publishers, funding organizations and scholarly societies.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the more complicated aspects of scientific writing is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/reference-management/">reference management</a> – an important limitation of online collaborative tools such as <em><em>Google Docs</em></em>. I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/05/blogging-beyond-the-pdf/">argued before</a> that WordPress has the potential to become a great scientific writing tool. Wordpress can’t do reference management out of the box, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=bibtex">available plugins</a> are somewhat limited. But WordPress is a good platform to add reference management functions: it is not only extremely popular (meaning a lot of people have expertise and many tools are available), but also already knows a lot about links, and has a wonderful plugin architecture.</p>
<h3 id="reference-database">Reference database</h3>
<p>The first question with reference management in WordPress is where to store the references. Should they not be stored at all and be directly imported from the source (journal website or bibliographic database such as PubMed)? This is what most of us are currently doing when writing blog posts, but this approach has obvious limitations on more ambitious writing projects. Or should references be inserted from an online reference manager such as CiteULike, Mendeley, Refworks or Endnote Web? This is how we use these reference managers with Microsoft Word and similar word processors.</p>
<p>Instead I prefer a third approach: store the references in the built-in Links Manager in WordPress. References are nothing more than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/11/citations-are-links-so-where-is-the-problem/">specialized links</a> after all. We loose functionality compared to reference manager databases, but we get some very interesting features for free, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broken-link-checker/">automatic checking of broken links</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/blogrollsync/">automatic link synchronization</a> with other WordPress installations, and all the other cool things for links that people have come up with. And this makes it much easier for authors to collaborate if they use different reference managers, as all required references are stored in a common database.</p>
<h3 id="bibtex-importer">BibTeX Importer</h3>
<p>There is currently no good solution to important references into the Links Manager, so I wrote a WordPress plugin to do just that. It took me two days, which says less about my skills, but more about the WordPress plugin architecture. Like all plugins hosted at WordPress.org, my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/">BibTeX Importer</a> plugin can be installed directly from within your WordPress installation in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The plugin takes any BibTeX file (BibTeX is one of the more common file formats for references, all good reference managers can export into that format) and imports it into the WordPress Links Manager. The plugin can also import a BibTex file via URL (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex/user/mfenner">http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex/user/mfenner</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/12/screenshot-2-500x198.jpg" title="BibTeX Importer" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>The plugin creates WordPress links where the link name is in the format <strong><strong>first author – year – title</strong></strong>. The original BibTeX entry is stored in the link notes. The plugin does some extra work, e.g. checks for duplicates before importing and picks the DOI if several URLs are available for the link. The plugin also checks the BibTex entry type (article, PhD thesis, book chapter, etc.) and automatically assigns a link category with that name. The next step would be a solution that automatically synchronizes your WordPress Links Manager with a reference manager.</p>
<h3 id="inserting-references">Inserting references</h3>
<p>Once the references are in the Links Manager, we can use them in the articles we write. Unfortunately WordPress doesn’t provide an easy way to do that. I personally like the WordPress TinyMCE editor, so I made some changes to the wonderful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-to-post/">Link to Post</a> plugin. The plugin provides a searchable interface to link to the posts, pages, categories and tags of your own WordPress blog. It took me half a day to add a link section, so now I can search for links and insert them into a post in a way not that different from how we use reference managers with Microsoft Word. The plugin also searches for co-authors, journal names and words in abstracts, as all this information is stored in the Link notes as BibTeX entry. I will make the updated Link to Post plugin available for download (I have contacted the plugin author), for the time being please contact me if you are interested.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/12/link2post-500x377.jpg" title="Link to Post" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<h3 id="providing-a-bibliography">Providing a bibliography</h3>
<p>This is the last feature that I need for reference management with WordPress, and that should also be feasible to do. Ideally the bibliography should be created automatically from the links in the text, using the BibTeX info stored in the links database. In fact, this is something that a publisher could also do after manuscript submission, as the required information is all there. The bibliography should use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">Citation Style Language,</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611082245/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a> (a standard for publishing machine-readable reference information in HTML), and should check for duplicate references, broken links, etc.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jason Rollins gave a presentation with that topic at the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=58">STM Innovations Seminar</a> in London. The video of his presentation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://river-valley.tv/new-and-emerging-technologies-for-reference-software/">has now been made available</a> by River Valley TV, and his slides are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2010_12_03_Innovations_Rollins_Bibliographic_Management_Software.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Jason talks about some recent trends in reference management software. For him one important new trend is APIs/extensions. I fully agree with him, but we haven’t really seen many tools based on these APIs. Reference managers that provide APIs include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://dev.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/api/">Endnote</a>, Refworks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://developer.mekentosj.com/">Papers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/">Zotero</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.connotea.org/wiki/WebAPI">Connotea</a>. The availability of an API has done a lot for the success of Web 2.0 tools such as Twitter and Flickr.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic was brought up in the discussion: should reference managers track difference versions of an article (e.g. pre-print, post-print, publisher PDF)? According to Jason many Endnote users request this feature. Jason is leading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> development team, but also mentions Mendeley, CiteULike and Papers in his presentation. I <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/endnote_interview_with_jason_rollins/">interviewed</a> Jason about Endnote back in August.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago <strong><strong>Eva Amsen</strong></strong> wrote in a thoughtful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094223/http://blogs.nature.com/eva/2010/12/05/a-metaphor-for-science-and-technology">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
There’s a gap between science and technology, and it’s growing.
</blockquote>
<p>Eva argues that – contrary to popular belief – there is actually a divide between science and technology. Scientists are on average not really comfortable using technology, and many computing tools aimed for scientists really miss the point of what scientists really care about.</p>

<p>Two days later, on December 7, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094223/http://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a>, a new division of Macmillan Publishing launched. From the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094223/http://international.macmillan.com/MediaArticle.aspx?id=2598">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Digital Science will focus on providing world-class software tools and services to scientists, managers and funders with the ultimate aim of making research more productive through the use of technology.
</blockquote>
<p>Initial products include the chemical text-mining tool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094223/http://www.surechem.org/">SureChem Portal</a>, the laboratory research management system <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094223/http://www.biodata.com/">BioData</a> and the research information system <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094223/http://www.symplectic.co.uk/products/publications.html">Symplectic Elements</a>. You might see some familiar faces when you look at the Digital Science <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094223/http://www.digital-science.com/meet-the-team/">team pictures</a>.</p>
<p>As a big fan of using technology for science I am looking forward to what Digital Science will do in the coming months. I am particularly interested in their answer to the questions asked by Eva. Have they found a better way to understand what technologies scientists really want? Or are tools for digital science something that the majority of scientists don’t really care about?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Citations are a fundamental concept of scholarly works. Unfortunately they are also difficult to do. Traditional writing tools such as Microsoft Word can’t really handle them in a way that is appropriate for a scientific manuscript, and that is why we have reference managers such as Endnote, Zotero or Mendeley. And the lack of this functionality is a major reason that Google Docs and other online collaborative writing tools haven’t become popular for writing scholarly works.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/4363633528_5026a5ce8b.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="500" height="333" alt="1958 Edsel Citation by Roadsidepictures, on Flickr." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em><em>1958 Edsel Citation by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.flickr.com/photos/roadsidepictures/">Roadsidepictures</a>, on Flickr.</em></em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using citations is hard for paper authors. The process is still complicated when using a reference manager, and it remains one of the more time consuming aspects of writing a manuscript. The main reason is that something always seems to go wrong with the formatting of the bibliography, but there are also issues of wrong or duplicate citations (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57698/">citation mutations</a>), correct citation styles, etc. I can’t comment on how well BibTeX integrates citation management into LaTeX, but the main issue seems to be that citations usually are not one of the core functions of the writing tool.</p>
<h3 id="wordpress-and-reference-managers">WordPress and reference managers</h3>
<p>The blogging platform <strong><strong>WordPress</strong></strong> could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/05/blogging-beyond-the-pdf/">become an excellent authoring platform</a> for scientific papers. But to become successful, WordPress has to handle scholarly citations, and not just with copy and paste. Carl Boettinger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/570">has written about doing citations in WordPress</a> ealier this week and there is also an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://friendfeed.com/science-2-0/deef8494/how-do-you-manage-citations-when-writing-on-web">ongoing FriendFeed discussion</a>. I have also looked at the available plugins, in particular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/papercite/">papercite</a> (based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bib2html/">bib2html</a>) which uses the BibTex format and is giving me some problems. I can’t get the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://labs.crossref.org/site/blog_plugins.html">CrossRef Citation plugin</a> to work (SyntaxError: Parse error) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mendeleyplugin/">Mendeley Plugin</a> is displaying bibliographies, rather than inserting citations. There is currently probably no easy solution to cite scholarly works in WordPress and I don’t think that creating a WordPress Plugin for one of the reference managers is the right approach.</p>
<h3 id="citations-are-links">Citations are links</h3>
<p>If we think about it, citations are nothing more than specialized links that contain additional information and formatting. And the references section is a list of footnotes. Links are a genuine part of WordPress, and this system should therefore also be used when writing scholarly works with WordPress. A Citation Plugin should extend this system, and solve these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress isn’t very smart about footnotes. I use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://www.elvery.net/drzax/wordpress-footnotes-plugin">WP-Footnotes</a> Plugin, but we need additional functionality: avoid duplicates, formatting options of in-text citations (e.g. range of citations or author-year) and sorting of footnotes by occurence or name.</li>
<li>The tool to create links in articles is not really integrated with the WordPress Links system (in contrast to images, where you have access to the media gallery when inserting an image).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of  these issues can be solved, especially since they are not specific to scholarly works and could be tackled by thousands of WordPress developers out there.</p>
<p>We don’t want to use WordPress as a reference manager, as there are already many tools out there that can do this job much better. We rather want reference manager integration with WordPress, and the easiest way to do this would be an automatic synchronization with the WordPress Links database. We can already do this with the social bookmarking tool <strong><strong>delicious</strong></strong> (I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-deliciouslinks/">DeliciousLinkSync</a>), so it shouldn’t be difficult to do this with the social bookmarking tools for scientists such as <strong><strong>CiteULike</strong></strong> (you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blog.citeulike.org/?p=174">sync CiteULike with delicious</a>, a workaround I currently use), <strong><strong>Connotea</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>BibSonomy</strong></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="links-are-powerful">Links are powerful</h3>
<p>Using the WordPress Links system makes it very easy to extend the core functionality, and many interesting tools are already out there. A good example is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broken-link-checker/">Broken Link Checker</a>. The Plugin can regularly check the links in your blog posts, but could also be used to check DOIs for references in a semi-automated way. The Broken Link Checker found 30 broken links in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2010/12/05/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications-2/">Blogging Beyond the PDF sample article</a> (all my fault), and automatically changed the display style for them.</p>
<p>And there is so much more that can be done with links. I am particularly interested in adding meaning to links using the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-1480-1-S1-S6">CiTO</a>). And I want to be able to cite specific parts of an article. Dave Winer has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/21/newBloggingTechniques.html">introduced</a> paragraph-level permalinks to blogs, and I can do this on WordPress using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://danielbachhuber.com/2010/10/27/winerlinks-v0-2-released/">WinerLinks Plugin</a>. The broken links in my Blogging Beyond the PDF sample article are all internal links, and I can now use WinerLinks to fix them. An example where I have already done this is the reference to Table S8 in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2010/12/05/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications-2/#p16">this paragraph</a>.</p>
<p><em><em>Update on 12/11/10: I’ve installed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611074314/http://ptsefton.com/2010/12/09/beyond-the-pdf-proposed-session-bring-the-web-to-the-researcher-mainly-on-authoring-tools.htm">Anotar Plugin</a> by Peter Sefton that adds paragraph-level commenting.</em></em></p>

The report was also discussed by Robert Kiley on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025454/http://ukpmc.blogspot.com/2010/12/submission-fees-viable-business-model.html">UK PubMed Central blog</a> and by Phil Davis on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025454/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/12/09/open-access-submission-fees/">Scholarly Kitchen blog</a>.</p>

<p>Submission fees are more common than I thought, particularly in economics and the life sciences. The American Physiological Society journals, <em><em>Cancer Research</em></em>, <em><em>FASEB Journal</em></em>, <em><em>Journal of Clinical Investigation</em></em>, <em><em>Journal of Immunology</em></em> and <em><em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></em> all charge submission fees between $50 and $100, the <em><em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em></em> dropped the $60 submission fee in 2010. Most journals that charge submission fees are society journals.</p>
<p>The report finds that submission fees would be particularly interesting for Open Access journals with high rejection rates (70% and more), as this would greatly reduce the article-procesing charges for accepted manuscripts. A journal that accepts 10% of submitted papers could use a $150 submission fee to reduce the fee for accepted manuscripts from $2500 to $1150. There wouldn’t really be a price reduction for journals that accept 50% of submitted papers.</p>
<p>Mark Ware reports that the Open Access publishers he talked to weren’t really interested in starting submission fees for their journals, mainly because of the risks involved in changing their business model. I personally believe that submission fees may be the only option for journals with high rejection rates to become Open Access journals (unless you want to cross-subsidize those journals). I like submission fees because they help to cover the actual costs involved, instead of the costs of handling manuscripts that are ultimately rejected being paid either by journal subscribers or the authors of accepted manuscripts.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four weeks ago I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">wrote about</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond the PDF</a> workshop that is planned for January in San Diego. The goal of the workshop is to identify a set of requirements, and a group of willing participants to develop open source code to accelerate scientific knowledge sharing. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://groups.google.com/group/beyond-the-pdf?pli=1">Google Group</a> for the workshop has already seen a lot of interesting discussions. I have since had more time to think about my contribution and decided to propose the following:</p>
<p><em><em>Evaluate the blogging software</em></em> <strong><strong><em><em>WordPress</em></em></strong></strong> <em><em>as a platform to author, review and publish scientific manuscripts. Extend the <strong><strong>WordPress</strong></strong> functionality for authors and citations.</em></em></p>
<h3 id="blogging-beyond-the-pdf">Blogging Beyond the PDF</h3>
<p>Wordpress is a very interesting candidate for this because of the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>WordPress is Open Source and can be easily modified and extended by Themes, Plugins, etc.</li>
<li>WordPress is used by millions of users, a market much larger than the scientific software market. Many requirements for a scientific writing platform are not specific for scientific software.</li>
<li>WordPress treats article writing as a workflow that includes collaborative writing, version control, and a document status.</li>

<p>Of course I’m not the first to think about WordPress in this context, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://journal.code4lib.org/">Code4Lib journal</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://knowledgeblog.org/">Knowledge Blog</a> are just two examples. To get started, I installed WordPress and a number of interesting Plugins at a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.xartrials.org/">Blogging Beyond the PDF</a> website. Phil Bourne has kindly provided material from a recent <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000976">paper</a> for the workshop. I formatted a first version of this paper using WordPress and the result can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2010/12/05/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications-2/">here</a>. There are a lot of rough edges (several tables and most references are still missing), but to me this looks good enough considering this is the result of maybe 10 hours of the work. In the next six weeks I will continue to work on this example manuscript to get a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the WordPress platform. I also hope to learn more from the experience of others. My first impressions are below.</p>
<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/co-authors-plus/">Co-Authors Plus</a> Plugin enables multiple authors per article. Each author can be linked to an author page for displaying biographical info. WordPress could be extended to include additional info such as institution or past publications. Linking the WordPress user account to the unique author identifier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>, and describing the role of the author in the paper (e.g. <em><em>conceived and designed the experiments</em></em> or <em><em>analyzed the data</em></em>) would be particularly interesting. Plugins such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.editflow.org/">Edit Flow</a> can extend the workflow by adding custom status messages (e.g. <em><em>resubmission</em></em>), reviewer comments, and email notifications.</p>
<h3 id="figures">Figures</h3>
<p>Wordpress has good functionality to add figures to articles, including the option to add a caption or resize the figure. In addition, there is a good number of Plugins that help with the resizing, other manipulations and display of images.</p>
<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
<p>Wordpress doesn’t do tables, but several Plugins add that functionality, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-english/">WP-Table Reloaded</a>. This Plugin adds some very interesting functions, including the option to export table data as CSV or XLS files. This makes it much easier to reuse these data, something that I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/30/why-cant-i-reuse-these-tables-and-figures/">find very useful</a>.</p>
<h3 id="citations">Citations</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.elvery.net/drzax/wordpress-footnotes-plugin">WP-Footnotes</a> Plugin is one of several plugins that adds footnotes to articles. Several Plugins integrate with reference managers such as CiteULike, but the functionality is still very limited compared to how most reference managers are integrated with Microsoft Word or LaTeX.</p>

The deadline for submissions is next Tuesday, and I have already received a number of interesting posts. As Christmas is right around the corner, I thought that a good theme for the carnival would be a <strong><strong>wish list for better medical information</strong></strong>. This could mean many different things, e.g. a database that covers a specific area, better access to full-text papers or clinical trial results, etc. Please submit your posts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612112930/http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_6092.html">here</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Monday I was finally able to start the clinical trial <strong><strong>Everolimus for patients with relapsed/refractory germ cell cancer</strong></strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185406/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/en/protocols/191.html">RADIT</a>), and I’m now looking forward to recruit the first patient. We aim to treat 25 patients with cancer of the testis with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in this phase II trial, and eight German hospitals are participating.</p>
<p>The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185406/http://www.icmje.org/publishing_10register.html">requires</a>, as a condition of consideration for publication in their journals, registration in a public trials registry. I registered my trial with Clinicaltrials.gov as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185406/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242631">NCT01242631</a>. The registration process was straightforward, especially compared to all the other paperwork required for this trial.</p>
<p>The requirement for registration of clinical trials helps to prevent publication bias – meaning that negative results are likely to never be  published. Clinical trial registries make it unlikely that you will be “scooped”, as you know about the other studies addressing the same questions years before they finish.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday I went to see the exhibition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032112/http://www.bl.uk/evolvingenglish/">Evolving English</a> at the British Library in London. The exhibition explores the English language in all its diversity and was recommended to me by Matt Brown, expert on all things London (his review for the Londonist is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032112/http://londonist.com/2010/11/review_evolving_english_british_lib.php">here</a>). <strong><strong>Evolving English</strong></strong> is interesting in many different ways, but here I want to focus on English as the language of science – used in two examples in the exhibition.</p>
<p>The book <em><em>Micrographia</em></em> from 1665 by Robert Hooke is the first major scientific work devoted to exploration using the microscope. It is also an important step in the development of scientific English. The book was praised for the clarity of the language at the time, but from today’s science writing perspective contains sentences that are too long and convoluted, uses conversational English, and frequently the active voice. The National Library of Medicine provides a beautiful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032112/http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/flash/hooke/hooke.html">online version</a> of the book, where observation XXV starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>A nettle is a plant so well known to every one, as to what the appearance of it is to the naked eye, that it needs no description; and there are very few that have not felt as well as seen it; and therefore it will be no news to tell that a gentle and slight touch of the skin by a nettle, does oftentime, not onely create very sensible and acute pain, much like that of a burn or scald, but often also very angry and hard swellings and inflammations of the parts, such as will presently rise and continue swoln divers hours.</em></em>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example of current scientific English, the exhibitors picked the paper describing the cloning of Dolly (Wilmut 1997). The text is described in the exhibition as:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>The language is punctual throughout and technical terms are mostly used without explanation. The main text is supported by illustrations (here called figures), tables of data and – over the page – bibliographic references to other scientific research. The purpose is to to maximize accuracy, remove any chance of ambiguity and provide writers with every opportunity to give detailed evidence.</em></em>
</blockquote>
<p>The exhibition makes it very clear that the English language is constantly evolving, and scientific English is no exception. Papers written in 10, 20 or 100 years might use a very different language. One important influence today is of course science writing in blogs and other social media. And with electronic publishing, open access, citizen science and other trends, scientific papers have become available to a much larger audience.</p>

<p>Thanks to Duncan Hull we know that PubMed currently contains information about 20 million papers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://duncan.hull.name/2010/07/27/pubmed-20-million/">Twenty million papers in PubMed: a triumph or a tragedy?</a>). About 10% of these papers are available as fulltext from PubMed Central. What wasn’t clear to me and what I learned from the paper is that only 194,000 papers, or 1% of PubMed content, are from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/openftlist.html">PMC Open Access Subset</a> (and that includes papers with a non-commercial OA license). All these papers are available as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/ftp.html">download</a> or via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/oai.html">PMC-OAI service</a>. Although 1.8 million papers (the majority digitized back issues) can be freely downloaded as full-text from PubMed Central, they carry a publisher copyright and can’t be reused for research purposes (e.g. full-text mining) without an explicit permission from the publisher.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) initiative is working on a unique researcher identifier for the creation of a clear and unambiguous scholarly record. The initiative is supported by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/directory">more than 140</a> universities, research institutes, funding organizations, publishers and other organizations interested in scholarly communication. The ORCID system will become publicly available in the first half of 2011.</p>
<p>Individual researchers will benefit from a unique researcher identifier because this identifier facilitates the manuscript submission process, and the creation of CVs and publication lists for institutional websites. Unique researcher identifiers will also help discover scholarly works and will make it easier to attribute scientific contributions other than papers –  e.g. research datasets – to individual researchers.</p>
<p>Researchers have a lot to gain from unique researcher identifiers, and they might also have genuine concerns. Because of my interest in scholarly communication, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">unique researcher identifiers in particular</a>, I became involved with the ORCID initiative in early 2010. When ORCID became a non-profit organization in August, I was asked to sit on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/board-directors">Board of Directors</a> – one of many interesting things that have happened to me as the result of my science blogging. But although ORCID is certainly open to all individuals and organizations interested in author disambiguation, most researchers simply want to be informed about the progress of the initiative, ask specific questions and start using their identifier at some point.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID website</a> is a good starting for this information, but to get individual answers to specific researcher questions about ORCID, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/kristiholmes">Kristi Holmes</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/gthorisson">Gudmundur Thorisson</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/CameronNeylon">Cameron Neylon</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://twitter.com/mfenner">myself</a> today started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://groups.google.com/group/orcid-researchers">ORCID Researchers</a> Google Group.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My post last week about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/18/new-in-plos-one-citation-rates-of-self-selected-vs-mandated-open-access/">citation rates of mandated vs. self-selected Open Access</a> resulted in an interesting discussion thanks to some good arguments made by Stevan Harnad. One personal conclusion for me: mandates for self-archiving are not a good idea. I would very much prefer researchers to be highly motivated to self-archive thanks to a repository that is both fulfilling important functions and is fun to use.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/17th/4088667379_880b0a796a.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="452" height="500" alt="Flickr image by diff.jisc (more info)." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em><em>Flickr image by diff.jisc (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.flickr.com/photos/dff-jisc/4088667379/">more info</a>).</em></em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What follows is a short list of ideas – many of them obvious and some of them already implemented – that for me would make repositories more attractive to use.</p>
<h3 id="hosting-of-research-datasets">Hosting of research datasets</h3>
<p>Disciplinary and institutional repositories are good places to make primary research data publicly available. Particularly if no standard database exists, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a> for genetic sequence data. Whereas everybody nowadays talks about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/~/link.aspx?_id=28A2778937C74EB285F05E38BFBD5DEE&amp;_z=z">making research data available</a>, the threshold to do so is often too high for more specialized datasets. An institutional repository is a good place for simple grassroots solution.</p>
<h3 id="a-disciplinary-repository-for-biomedical-research">A disciplinary repository for biomedical research</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK PubMed Central</a> are very popular disciplinary repositories for the biomedical and life sciences. Unfortunately I can only submit manuscripts to them if the research was funded by one of a few funders (including the NIH, but none of the major German funders).</p>
<h3 id="a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials">A preprint archive for clinical trials</h3>
<p>Deposition of manuscripts prior to peer review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/09/new-on-arxiv-first-report-of-soap-open-access-publishing-project/">has a long tradition</a> in high-energy physics and related disciplines. Preprint archives probably don’t work in all disciplines, but I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">argued before</a> that they could be a very good idea for clinical trials.</p>
<h3 id="journal-publishers-that-allow-self-archiving">Journal publishers that allow self-archiving</h3>
<p>While most publishers allow some form of self-archiving by authors (pre-print, post-print and/or publisher’s PDF version), there are unfortunately still exceptions. The American Chemical Society (ACS) has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://scientopia.org/blogs/bookoftrogool/2010/10/05/acs-the-perfect-storm/">particularly unwelcoming policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="integration-with-the-journal-submission-process">Integration with the journal submission process</h3>
<p>An institutional repository can host pre-prints of submitted papers. But the repository could also enable a tighter integration with the journal submission process. The German <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/https://www.escidoc.org/JSPWiki/en/Overview">eSciDoc</a> project uses that approach. Most researchers would probably welcome technical and financial assistance in the submission process.</p>
<h3 id="integration-with-institutional-bibliography">Integration with institutional bibliography</h3>
<p>The institutional bibliography showcases the scholarly work done by a particular researcher, research group, department or institution. Many researchers like to see up-to-date profiles (including publication lists) on their institutional webpages. Bibliographies are also collected for evaluation purposes. We have started to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.bibapp.org/">BibApp</a> at our institution. Repositories can facilitate full-text access to PhD theses and other publications in the bibliography.</p>
<h3 id="repositories-that-use-unique-author-identifiers">Repositories that use unique author identifiers</h3>
<p>Regular readers of this blog know about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">my involvement</a> in the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative. All scholarly contributions, including repository content, should be unambiguously connected to their creators as this will greatly facilitate the discovery process. I look forward to ORCID support in repository software such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.eprints.org/">EPrints</a>.</p>

<p>I downloaded the iBooks version for iPad/iPhone. The columns read nicely on the iPad display (almost all of them are text-only, a few contain images and/or links), and the texts are of course thoughtful and entertaining. Here are a few teasers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Petsko G (2009a). Nation of twits. https://doi.org/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191225/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2009-10-8-110">10.1186/gb-2009-10-8-110</a>.</li>
<li>Petsko G (2009b). What my genome told me – and what it didn’t. https://doi.org/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191225/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2009-10-6-108">10.1186/gb-2009-10-6-108</a>.</li>
<li>Petsko G (2008). Having an impact (factor).<br />

</ul>
<p>Suggestion for <em><em>Genome Biology</em></em>: if you want more people to read the column, create an RSS feed for it. Or even better, turn it into a blog.</p>
<p>Suggestion for <em><em>EMBO Reports</em></em>: pick up the idea and create an eBook with the editorials by <strong><strong>Frank Gannon</strong></strong>, who wrote a similarly thoughtful column for them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191225/http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2009/04/frank_gannon_says_farewell_to.html">until April 2009</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> today published a paper very relevant to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a> (which started today):</p>
<p><strong><strong>Gargouri Y, Hajjem C, Larivière V, Gingras Y, Carr L, Brody T, Harnad S</strong></strong>.

<p>The paper studied the citation rates of papers from four institutions with the longest-standing self-archiving mandate: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://www.soton.ac.uk/">Southampton University</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://www.qut.edu.au/">Queensland University of Technology</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://www.uminho.pt/Default.aspx?lang=en-US">Minho University</a>. The mandates (instituted between 2002 and 2004) increased the rate of self-archiving in the respective institutional repositories from around 15% to 60%:</p>

<p>The authors then compared the citation rates of self-archived papers from the four institutions published in non-Open Access (OA) journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeoinfo.html">mandated OA</a>) to matched papers from the same non-OA journal, volume and year (non-OA). 15% of the latter papers were also available from repositories (self-selected OA). Overall the study examined the citations of 27,197 papers from 1,984 non-OA journals. The study also looked at the influence of other factors that affect citation rates, e.g. article age, journal impact factor or number of references.</p>
<p>The main results of the study are that OA articles are cited more frequently than non-OA articles and that there is no difference in citation rates between mandated and self-archived articles. The authors conclude that OA articles are cited more often not because of self-selection (articles with higher impact more likely become OA), but because of readers cite OA articles more often.</p>
<p>The study is an effort to better understand if and why OA papers are cited more often, the so-called OA Advantage. Unfortunately I feel that the paper comes a little short. Yes, they did a very detailed analysis of the citation behavior, and take into account important cofactors. But the reader is left with the impression that mandatory self-archiving of post-prints in institutional repositories is the only reasonable Open Access strategy, and the introduction and discussion accordingly leave out some important arguments.</p>
<p>The authors fail to mention that not all studies show a citation advantage for OA articles (e.g. the randomized controlled trial by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114042817/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.a568">Davis PM et al. 2008</a>), and they only look at self-archiving in institutional repositories (green OA). Not only are there important disclipline-specific repositories such as PubMed Central and ArXiv, but of course also OA journals such as <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> that published the study (gold OA). And the study only discussed archiving of articles after peer review, even though archiving of preprints is a popular strategy in high-energy physics and related disciplines (and here the self-archiving rate is close to 100%). I also don’t see a discussion of why the self-archiving rate of post-prints in institutions with a mandate is 60% and not close to 100%. And what is wrong if archiving rates are only around 15% if it is left to the researchers to decide? Finally, there are many reasons other than citation rates that make OA worthwhile, including access to the literature for those not working in academic institutions (and maybe never citing a paper), and work that uses the OA literature in new and exciting ways that go beyond citations. For me personally, the OA advantage is much more in these two aspects than in the citation rates of papers.</p>
<p>For me Open Access week is an opportunity to celebrate what has been achieved over the years. But it is equally important to look at the road ahead. There is no “one size fits all” solution for Open Access, and we shouldn’t look away from the things that aren’t working, and the solutions that haven’t been found yet.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> preprint archive for research articles in physics, mathematics, computer science and related disciplines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/blurb/pg02pr.html">was initiated</a> by Paul Ginsparg in 1991. ArXiv enables the rapid dissemination of research articles prior to peer review, and it quickly became very successful in this. ArXiv has not made the peer-reviewed journal obsolete, but rather provides a service that traditional journals – and that also includes Open Access journals – can’t provide. By 1998, more than 90% of all peer-reviewed papers published in high-energy physics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418">first appeared on ArXiv</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a> was started in 2007 to provide similar services for research in biology, medicine (except clinical trials), chemistry and earth sciences. In addition, many preprints are also hosted in institutional repositories.</p>
<p>The research that I am doing is clinical research, trying to improve the treatment of patients with cancer. Most clinical trials are drug trials, but there are also surgical interventions, trials with medical devices, etc. Clinical trials are a special kind of research, and I have talked about some aspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances-and-problems-of-doing-science-online">in a previous post</a>. Registration of clinical trials before the first patient is treated – providing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/trds/en/index.html">key information</a> from the trial protocol – is now required in many countries, including the United States and the European Union. The U.S. database of registered clinical trials (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>) is publicly available, and the EU is working on doing the same with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/">EudraCT</a> database. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), and in consequence many medical journals, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.icmje.org/publishing_10register.html">requires clinical trial registration</a>. Since September 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">requires</a> all clinical trials registered at Clinicaltrials.gov to provide key results within 12 months after the last patient has finished treatment.</p>

</figure>
<p>The results of clinical trials are rarely first reported in a peer-reviewed journal, but rather are usually first presented at a conference – in the case of important practice-changing clinical trials often before an audience of thousands of people. The conference abstracts are also an important source of information, even though they don’t provide the space for more detailed information, including tables and figures. Many societies publish conference abstract in their society journals, but bibliographic databases such as PubMed probably don’t cover all conference abstracts reporting clinical trial results.</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed paper is usually published months or even years after the conference presentation. This not only allows for more mature data – e.g. survival information – but also critical review and discussion of the data. The publication of the peer-reviewed paper is <strong><strong>not</strong></strong> the first time the medical community learns about the results of a clinical trial, or draws conclusions for their own research or clinical practice. To take a recent example from a clinical trial in cancer: the results of the TROPIC trial of cabazitaxel chemotherapy in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer (Clinicaltrials.gov <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00417079">NCT00417079</a>) were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=73&amp;abstractID=30560">first reported</a> at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium March 5 (and there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://en.sanofi-aventis.com/binaries/20100304_Asco_GU_en_tcm28-27547.pdf">press release</a> a day earlier). Capazitaxel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm216214.htm">was approved</a> by the FDA on June 17, and I treated the first patient with the drug in September. The peer-reviewed paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61389-X">was published</a> in <em><em>The Lancet</em></em> October 2.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that we need a preprint archive for clinical trial research papers. The preprints should be uploaded at the time of journal submission, or shortly after the conference presentation. The preprint server should add some structure to the preprints, e.g. linking to both the clinical trials registry (Clinicaltrials.gov, EudraCT, and others) and the published paper. The preprint should fulfill the requirement for reporting results set by the FDA. Articles in the preprint archive should be freely available, and should ideally provide the main results as downloadable datasets. The preprint server will only work if medical journals – and ideally the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105203901/http://www.icmje.org/">ICMJE</a> – have a clear policy allowing prior publication as preprint.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last few weeks I haven’t seen any announcement for a new science blogging network (the last one was probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blog.coturnix.org/2010/09/15/alert-some-big-and-important-and-exciting-news/">Scientific American</a> in September). So I thought today would be a good day to start a new one. Earlier today I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blogs.mh-hannover.de/tumorzentrum/2010/10/15/herzlich-willkommen/">the first post</a> on the first blog hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://www.mh-hannover.de/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1">my institution</a>. The blog runs on a WordPress 3.0 installation that I hope will see more blogs in the future – our library will probably be next (they are currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://mhhbibliothek.wordpress.com/">hosted on WordPress.com</a>).</p>

<p>The new blog is the official blog of our Comprehensive Cancer Center (my day job). I will write about various aspects of the work there – something I wanted to do for a while. This is also the first time that I write in German, which will be much easier, but at the same time will reach a smaller audience. Writing for my institution will also be an interesting experience. Although I don’t think that this will start something big at our institution, institutions are in fact a good place for blogging networks. Special thanks go to Stefan Zorn in our PR department for encouraging words, and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/about-the-authors/">Henry Scowcroft</a> from Cancer Research UK for many good tips about blogging for an institution.</p>
<p>The new blog of course doesn’t mean that I stop writing here. I’m too deep into this.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204928/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/08/nature-com-iphone-app-in-pictures">wrote about</a> the Nature.com iPhone application that was released in February. Two weeks ago the app was updated with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to abstracts from additional journals: <em><em>Nature Genetics</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Medicine</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Biotechnology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Reviews Microbiology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Reviews Genetics, Nature Physics</em></em> and <em><em>Nature Communications.</em></em></li>
<li><em><em>Access to fulltext articles for a monthly subscription fee ($9.99 for Nature, $8.99 for the other journals). Access to Nature News and Nature Communications is free.</em></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The updated app doesn’t work with the iPad, and the Android version that was announced in February has not been released yet. Users that don’t update to the newest version of the app don’t get access to additional journals, but can still read full-text articles from Nature.</p>
<p>Reading papers on the iPad for me is a lot of fun. The reading experience on the iPhone/iPod touch is very different, and not something I would spend $9.99 a month for. But it is obvious where this is heading: many users (including myself) would probably spend $9.99/month for a nicely done iPad version of Nature. Especially if content is free/cheaper with an institutional subscription. And we can already read PLoS content for free with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204928/http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2010/09/16/plos-reader-2-0/">PLoS Reader</a>.</p>

<p>The survey asks questions about the main services that users expect from ORCID, and how the ORCID service should be paid for (e.g. membership fees or fee-for service).</p>
<p>In quick response to the announcement of the survey on Twitter, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://friendfeed.com/researchremix/d5611278/rt-orcid_org-please-help-us-move-orcid-forward">interesting discussion</a> started on <strong><strong>FriendFeed</strong></strong>. Several commenters were worried that ORCID tries to be too much. Their thoughts were nicely summarized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://twitter.com/#!/CameronNeylon/status/27158241887">this tweet</a> by <strong><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>Agree with @ReaderMeter + @mrgunn: @ORCID_Org will be a success when it does amazing things for me and I barely notice it’s there.</em></em>

<p>The survey is open until October 28, the results will be reported in November.</p>

<p>This is the second time I will go to the conference – I had a wonderful time in 2009. The discussion around the 2009 session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185427/http://jdupuis.blogspot.com/2009/01/scienceonline-09-sunday-summary-and.html">Reputation, Authority and Incentives</a> (moderated by Björn Brembs and Pete Binfield) was really the starting point for my interest in unique researcher identifiers. The conference was also the first time that I met PLoS Blogs partner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185427/http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected/">David Kroll</a> and many other great people.</p>
<p>You will find my name on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185427/http://scio11.wikispaces.com/Program+Finalization">preliminary program</a> in a session <strong><strong>Having Fun with Citations</strong></strong> (together with Melody Dye)<strong><strong>:</strong></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>Citations play a central role in science communication, but their role in the traditional scientific publication is often rather boring. We love to count citations for measures of scientific impact, but we spend little time thinking about the context and meaning of citations. In this session I would like to talk about topics ranging from semantic meaning of citations (using CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology by David Shotton), citations of retracted papers, citations of datasets (using Datacite), the importance of an Open Bibliography, formatting of citations using CSL (Citation Style Language), citations in Twitter and other unusual places, citation mutations and the integration of unique researcher identifiers (using ORCID). There is some interesting work on how citation rates follow Zipfian-like distributions; it would be interested to discuss the background and implications.</em></em>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact session format and the other session moderators have not been finalized. There are also at least two related session proposals: <strong>How is the Web changing the way we identify scientific impact?</strong> (Jason Priem, Paul Groth) <strong><strong></strong></strong> and <strong><strong>The Digital Toolbox: What’s Needed?</strong></strong> (Kaitlin Thaney) – we might combine some of our ideas. And of course I am also looking forward to again meet all these wonderful people that are interested in science and the web.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The iPad was released six months ago, and we already have several reference managers available for the platform. Reading the PDF of a scientific paper on an iPad is a positive experience, and to me very different from reading the PDF on a regular computer. While this could also be done with generic iPad PDF readers such as <strong><strong>iBooks</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>Goodreader</strong></strong>, reference managers make it much easier to organize a large collection of PDF files.</p>
<h3 id="citeulike">CiteULike</h3>
<p>CiteULike is a browser-based reference manager and works on the iPad as expected – and this includes the bookmarklet. CiteULike is a good tool to collect references when browsing with the iPad. CiteULike doesn’t allow offline reading of PDF files. While you can read the HTML versions of papers with the iPad web browser, this requires not only online access, but often also access through a paywall.<br />
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090748/http://www.citeulike.org/">More Info</a></p>
<h3 id="papers-for-ipad">Papers for iPad</h3>
<p>This was the first reference manager specifically designed for the iPad. Papers for Mac owners can synchronize all their references and fulltext PDF files. The functionality is similar to the Mac version and also includes a good PDF reader and searching for references in PubMed and other online databases. This makes Papers a good stand-alone solution that doesn’t depend on syncing to another applications.<br />

<h3 id="mendeley-lite">Mendeley Lite</h3>
<p>Mendeley Lite syncs with all references you store in your Mendeley web account. I personally prefer this approach as I don’t particularly like syncing between iPad and desktop computer. Just like Papers, this application works both on iPad and iPhone. You can’t directly add references to Mendeley Lite. Mendeley is currently the only application that has both a web-based and an iPad version. This increases the options, but probably also adds to user confusion. Add reference with the web-based version, sync, then read PDF in Mendeley Lite?<br />

<h3 id="sente-viewer-for-ipad">Sente Viewer for iPad</h3>
<p>Last Friday <strong><strong>Sente Viewer for iPad</strong></strong> was released. Similar to Papers and Mendeley, Sente Viewer for iPad synchronizes with the desktop version of the application. The application allows browsing of all synchronized references and reading of the associated fulltext PDF papers. The <strong><strong>Sente for iPad</strong></strong> application will be released later and will also allow adding and editing of references. I’m looking forward to “targeted browsing” which will capture both reference information and fulltext PDF files using a built-in web browser – another variation of reference manager integration with the web browser.<br />

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PDF has become the standard way we consume scientific papers, but in fact is not a good format for this purpose at all. Or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.mjrobbins.net/">Martin Robbins</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.nature.com/franknorman/2010/09/10/my-science-online-london-2010-impressions">said at the recent Science Online London conference</a>: <em><em>PDF is an insult to science</em></em>. The problem was nicely illustrated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/">Duncan Hull</a>, using a quote from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/">Peter Murray-Rust</a> from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=1069">May 2008</a> article:</p>

<p>There are of course ways journal publishers can add metadata to PDF files, e.g. using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/">XMP</a> markup. But that is only a workaround – what we really want is journal papers in a format that is all about document structure and not about looking good in print. XML is obviously that format with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM-DTD</a> as the de facto standard for scholarly publications. Many journal publishers use that format internally, as does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> for displaying fulltext papers, as well as archiving projects such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/">Portico</a>.</p>
<p>But there are two problems with how NLM-DTD is used now. The first problem is that most scientific papers still are ultimately read as printouts of PDF files, even though most journals now are online only. I wrote in January that this reading behavior is starting to change (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/">How do you read papers? 2010 will be different</a>), and new article formats – such as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/26/how_does_the_article_of_the_future_look_like/">Article of the Future</a> by Cell Press – and the success of the iPad are two major reasons for that.</p>
<p>The second problem is that there are no good NLM-DTD tools for authors. <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/lemon8_xml_interview_with_mj_suhonos/">Lemon8-XML</a> and the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/">Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-In</a> are two examples that I have written about before. Publishers spend a significant amount of time and money (and using tools such as <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/extyles_interview_with_elizabeth_blake_and_bruce_rosenblum/">eXtyles</a>) to convert submitted manuscripts from Microsoft Word, Open Office or LaTeX formats into NLM-DTD. I wrote about my <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/my_paper_writing_dream_machine_1_0/">paper writing dream machine</a> that would use the NLM-DTD more than two years ago. I still believe that the ideal authoring tool should be web-based, but in 2010 this should be done in HTML5 and not Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight.</p>
<p>The two problems are obviously related. When more people are reading papers in other formats than PDF and see the advantages, it changes the idea of a scientific paper that most people have from a static document do a document that is enriched with primary research data, visualizations that use 3D and video, links to related resources, the possibility to comment, and has more than one document version. In other words, what HTML and the WWW <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">were invented for</a> by Tim Berners-Lee when working at CERN. At this point the incentives to create better authoring tools will be much greater, and the second problem should solve itself. And HTML and related technologies have now evolved to the point where they allow the building of some very attractive authoring tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.sdsc.edu/~bourne/">Phil Bourne</a> has written and talked a lot about this problem, including a recent editorial in <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000787">What do I want from the publisher of the future?</a>) and a related <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.scivee.tv/node/18299">SciVee video</a>. He has also been working very hard to organize the <strong><strong>Beyond the PDF</strong></strong> workshop, to be held in San Diego January 19-21. The workshop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">website</a> went live last week and is a very good source of information. The goal of the workshop is to identify a set of requirements and to start developing open source code that accelerates moving beyond PDF for scientific papers.</p>
<p>I will of course do everything possible to attend this workshop, but haven’t yet secured funding for the trip. What I hope to contribute to the <strong><strong>Beyond the PDF</strong></strong> project is a more intelligent use of citations (the following was also posted to the Beyond the PDF <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://groups.google.com/group/beyond-the-pdf">discussion group</a>):</p>
<h3 id="unique-author-identifiers">Unique Author Identifiers</h3>
<p>Unique author identifiers such as <a href="https://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> not only are a big help in knowledge discovery (finding other interesting papers, datasets, etc. by the same person), but they can also help to better define the contributions of a researcher to a particular paper. This could mean a general description of the contribution (had idea for project, collected data, helped write manuscript, etc.), or could also describe a very specific contribution (researcher X did experiment Y).</p>
<h3 id="citation-styles">Citation styles</h3>
<p>We already have far too many citation styles, but the styles we use<br />
have several important shortcomings. I suggest the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> instead of volume and page numbers whenever possible</li>
<li>Use <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> to link to the authors of the citations</li>
<li>Use the Citation Typing Ontology (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2009/03/citation_typing_ontology.html">CiTO</a>) to describe the meaning of the citation</li>
<li>Use a note field to explain why the citation was used</li>
</ul>
<p>Any authoring tool should obviously use the Citation Style Language (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">CSL</a>) to format citations. And the citations should be provided with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC Zero</a> or similar license to allow reuse.</p>
<h3 id="cited-by">Cited by</h3>
<p>At least as important as the citations by a particular paper are the incoming citations, the works that cite a paper. We need much better mechanisms to automate these “trackbacks”, and this should go beyond other papers and also include datasets, blog posts, etc. The incoming citations are of course very helpful for discovery, and the basis for <a href="https://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">alternative metrics</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.academicproductivity.com/2010/readermeter-crowdsourcing-research-impact/">blog post last week</a>, Dario Taraborelli officially announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://readermeter.org/">ReaderMeter</a>. ReaderMeter takes the usage data from reference managers (starting with <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>) to analyze the impact of publications by a particular author.</p>
<p>ReaderMeter is a welcome addition to other metrics of researcher impact, most of which are citation-based. And ReaderMeter was hacked together in a few nights, so the service should improve over time. Dario mentions some of the current limitations in his blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Usage data only from Mendeley</strong></strong>. We don’t know whether the reading patterns of users from other reference managers (e.g. CiteULike, Zotero, Endnote Web and Refworks) differ. Dario is working on adding more services.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Author disambiguation</strong></strong>. This is a critical component, and the <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">ORCID</a> initiative is probably the best tool to overcome this limitation, especially when data from several reference managers have to be integrated.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Article disambiguation</strong></strong>. Multiple copies of the same reference are common in reference manager databases. The <a href="https://doi.org/">DOI</a> can solve this problem for those publications that have a DOI, but consequent use of the DOI by journals, citation databases and reference managers has yet to become standard practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>ReaderMeter is visually pleasing and fun to use. And the data are also provided in JSON format, which allows integration into other web pages, e.g. the researcher’s home page.</p>

<p>Electronic publication has dramatically simplified the reuse of tables and figures, and therefore reuse has become very common – you probably find reused material in most presentations given in academic institutions or at conferences.</p>
<p>Most authors will probably be happy that their results are disseminated, and reuse is likely to lead to more people reading the full paper and citing the work.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/bmccancer-e1285879074865.jpeg" title="bmccancer" class="kg-image" width="500" height="450" alt="From https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-10-286." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">From https://doi.org/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-10-286">10.1186/1471-2407-10-286</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But this reuse has two problems. The first problem is copyright. Many journals own the copyright of the papers they publish and don’t allow reuse without prior permission. Unfortunately copyright is a complicated issue, and also differs between countries. Most researchers assume “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">Fair use</a>“ when they reuse material, but this might not apply to all situations, e.g. presentations at conferences. And many researchers don’t understand that they have often given away the copyright to their own works, so that they can’t show a figure from one of their papers without permission.</p>
<p>Many publishers have automated the process of obtaining permissions for copyrighted work, e.g. using the <a href="http://www.copyright.com/viewPage.do?pageCode=pu4-n">Rightslink</a> system of the Copyright Clearance Center. But it still requires a considerable investment in time (and often money) to obtain all permissions, especially since these are usually one-time permissions only. This combination of unawareness of the details of copyright law and the required extra work means that many researchers probably don’t obtain permissions prior to reuse.</p>
<p>The solution to the copyright problems is obviously to use material with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license whenever possible, as I have done in this blog post. And most Open Access papers are published under this license, so there is plenty of material to choose from.</p>
<p>But there is also a second problem with reusing tables and figures. They were designed to be part of a paper and often look terrible in a presentation, particularly tables.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/10th/plosone-e1285879245843.png" title="plosone" class="kg-image" width="500" height="402" alt="From https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em><em>From</em> https://doi.org/</em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022"><em><em>10.1371/journal.pone.0006022</em></em></a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The solution to this problem is to provide the data behind the table or figure, so that the information can be displayed in a way that makes sense in a presentation. Here we usually have to reduce the amount of information, but it could also mean that we remix the content with other sources. The Creative Commons licenses discussed above are <a href="http://pantonprinciples.org/">not appropriate</a> for data. Whenever possible, scientific data should be placed in the public domain.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish the publication of table and figure data from the publication of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525130956/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/bmc_research_notes_wants_your">whole research dataset</a>. The open questions with the latter (e.g. standard data formats, appropriate repositories, archiving) don’t apply to the former. This means that publishers could start providing these data immediately. I’m confident that they would see an increase in paper downloads and citations. But more importantly I hope this would lead to better presentations in seminars and at conferences.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Christian Specht,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57698/">your detailed response</a> in <em><em>The Scientist</em></em> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/20/letter-to-the-scientist/">our previous letter</a> regarding citation mutations. You clarified several issues that were raised in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57689/">your original study</a>, particularly that citation mutation rates have dropped significantly in the last 10 years (probably due to the more widespread use of reference management software), and that some citation mutations (e.g. 680→685 in Laemmli 1970) might be introduced not by citing authors, but by the citation database.</p>
<p>You rightfully point out that citation mutations indicate a much bigger problem: <em><em>authors often do not read the publications cited in their work</em></em>. I am not aware of any available direct data, but in an ongoing study Richard Grant is looking at this question (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://blog.the-scientist.com/2010/09/23/mutatis-citandi/">Do you read the papers you cite?</a>). The preliminary data that Richard kindly made available indicate that more than 85% of authors indeed read the papers they cite.</p>
<p>In another study made aware to us by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://twitter.com/noahWG/status/25410352261">Noah Gray</a>, Neale et al. (Neale 2009) used an elegant experimental design to address the same question. They studied lethal acquired mutations – retracted papers that in theory should no longer be cited – as an estimate of how diligent authors were reading the papers they cite.</p>
<p>The authors compared the number of citations of 102 retracted papers (starting 12 months after the retraction) to a control group of papers and found no difference in the average number of citations (26 vs. 27). Content analysis of a subset of citing papers indicated that more than 50% of citations used the retracted paper to support their own findings and less than 5% of citing papers mentioned the retraction.</p>
<p>These findings not only seem to contradict the preliminary findings by Richard Grant, but also indicate that journal publishers and citation databases may not be properly communicating paper retractions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Citation styles are one of the greater mysteries for the novice manuscript writer. There are numerous ways that authors, title, journal, etc. can be arranged and formatted (see examples below), and in bibliographies citations can be ordered either alphabetically or by order of appearance in the text.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Laemmli UK</strong></strong>. Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4. <em><em>Nature</em></em>. 1970;227:680-685.</p>
<p><strong><strong>U. K. Laemmli</strong></strong> (1970). ‘Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4′. <em><em>Nature</em></em> <strong><strong>227</strong></strong>(5259):680-685.</p>
<p><strong><strong>U. K. Laemmli</strong></strong>, <em><em>Nature</em></em> <strong><strong>227</strong></strong>, 680 (1970).</p>
<p>Because of this complexity, it has long become impractical to format citations manually, and formatting of citations and bibliographies is one of the main reasons for using reference management software. I interviewed Rintze Zelle (scientist and open source contributor) and Ian Mulvany (vice president of new product development at Mendeley) to better understand citation styles in general and the open source Citation Style Language (CSL) in particular. CSL co-developers Bruce D’Arcus and Frank Bennett provided important feedback.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-is-the-citation-style-language"><strong><strong>1. What is the Citation Style Language?</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Rintze Zelle: Scientific literature depends heavily on proper referencing. However, when writing a manuscript, manually editing citations and bibliographies is time consuming and error prone. Citation styles also differ between scientific journals, so authors often have to switch citation styles when they submit their manuscript to a different journal than originally anticipated.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/">Citation Style Language</a> (CSL) is an open XML based language meant to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies. When provided with the metadata (title, year, authors, etc.) of the cited items (journal articles, books, etc.), and a CSL style, a CSL processor can automatically generate the bibliography and in-text citations. CSL is currently used by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, and both programs offer word processor plug-ins for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/">Microsoft Word</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>. Several other projects are working on or exploring CSL support.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-we-really-need-hundreds-of-citation-styles">2. Do we really need hundreds of citation styles?</h3>
<p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: We have asked ourselves this question many times over. Some variability is certainly warranted: numeric, author-date and footnote styles are very different, and each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, small variations in citation styles result in a situation where almost every journal or publisher has its unique style. We think that even with the use of automated tools like CSL, reducing the number of citation styles in use could result in significant cost and time savings in scientific publishing. But this is a problem beyond the scope of CSL, so our goal is simply to support all the variability that currently exists in citation styles.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Ian Mulvany</strong></strong>: After working for many years at Springer, and then Nature, I was well aware that most large publishers just push submitted manuscripts out to companies in India where the formatting of the paper happens. The input format and citation formatting really doesn’t matter to most publishers. They just tear the submitted manuscript to pieces and rebuild it in their chosen XML schema.</p>
<p>However, most people using citations are not actually submitting manuscripts for publication, but rather are writing term papers, or theses, or reports. So the weird thing is that citations started off as a required identifier for the literature. Google Scholar and HTTP URIs such as the DOI have almost totally made formatted citations redundant as identifiers, and yet there is still a huge user need to be able to format citations according to a huge variety of styles, and since that need is going to continue for quite a long time, it’s a need that we have to support.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-the-difference-between-csl-and-other-citation-style-systems"><strong><strong>3. What is the difference between CSL and other citation style systems?</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Rintze Zelle: Our main “competition” arguably comes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.refman.com/">Reference Manager</a>. BibTeX is a popular choice for those working with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> typesetting system, but the user base of LaTeX is relatively small and mostly limited to the sciences. EndNote and Reference Manager are commercial tools offered by Thomson Reuters. While large collections of citation styles are available for each program, the use of these styles is limited to licensed users.</p>
<p>CSL was designed with three main goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>to create an open system that is independent of the operating system, application or document format,</li>
<li>to cover the full range of citation formatting rules in use, extending from the sciences to fields in the humanities as well as law,</li>
<li>to free end users from the complex task of formatting citations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Citation styles should be freely available, up to date, and complete. Switching between styles should be easy, and citation output should automatically localize to the desired language.</p>
<p>We think we’ve come quite far toward reaching these goals with our most recent release, CSL 1.0. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html">CSL 1.0 specification</a> covers a wide range of citation rules, and offers advanced features like automatic localization of date formats, terms and punctuation, support for in-field rich text and extensive support for the rendering and disambiguation of names. The first standalone CSL 1.0 processor (the JavaScript <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/">citeproc-js</a>) is currently being integrated into both Zotero and Mendeley, and is receiving attention for deployment on both the client and the server.</p>
<h3 id="4-can-you-tell-me-how-csl-was-developed">4. Can you tell me how CSL was developed?</h3>
<p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: CSL is the brainchild of Bruce D’Arcus, an associate professor of Geography at Miami University of Ohio. The language was initially implemented for integration into OpenOffice.org, but only became popular in 2006 when Zotero, the first reference manager to use CSL, was released. In these early days major contributions were made to CSL by Zotero developer Simon Kornblith. Subsequently, the Zotero project successfully fostered an active user community, with many users contributing styles to a growing repository of CSL styles.</p>
<p>The year 2008 was a watershed of new developments. Mendeley was released, the second reference manager to use CSL for its citation formatting. Andrea Rossato released the first standalone CSL processor (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://code.haskell.org/citeproc-hs/">citeproc-hs</a>) for use with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> text processing system. Also in 2008, two Zotero users who enjoyed the program but felt that CSL could be further improved joined Bruce in CSL development: myself, at that time a PhD researcher in biotechnology at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, and Frank Bennett, Jr., an associate law professor at Nagoya University in Japan. Together with Andrea, our different academic and geographic backgrounds proved very useful in CSL development. In preparation for major backward-incompatible changes, CSL 0.8 was released in 2009, and in Spring 2010 CSL 1.0 saw the light of day. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/2010/03/22/citation-style-language-1-0/">1.0 release</a> was accompanied by a move to a new website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://citationstyles.org/">citationstyles.org</a>, and included improved documentation in the form of a full language specification. CSL development has now calmed down a bit as we await the integration of CSL 1.0 by Zotero and Mendeley.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Ian Mulvany</strong></strong>: We at Mendeley have been using the Citation Style Language for quite a while now. We think it is an amazing project and we are very strongly committed to working with the CSL community in encouraging uptake. We get a lot of feedback from our users and one area that they constantly run into problems with is the need to be able to format a citation in just such a manner. The CSL project is the best way for us to be able to support the needs of our users with these kinds of requests. Our developers have been pushing patches upstream to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home">citeproc-js</a> project, particularly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/carles-pina/">Carles Pina</a>.</p>
<p>We have added a cut and paste stylebox on our article pages. If you have a look at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mendeley.com/research/karhunenloeve-eigenvalue-problems-cosmology-we-tackle-large-data-sets/">sample paper</a> you will now see a little citeproc-js driven “Cite this document” box that lets you copy and paste formatted citations in several popular citation styles. We have also been supporting the creation of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/csledit/csl-wysiwyg-editor">WISYWIG citation style editor</a>. The status of the project is that most of the code is complete and we just need to work on getting it integrated into our client, and figuring out the best way to manage the creation of more styles, and how that will work with the CSL community.</p>
<p>One of the things that we have been discussing with Bruce D’Arcus is how to manage the redistribution of new styles, and how to make sure that corrupt styles don’t propagate, and that people get the style that they are looking for. If people want to contribute there is a lot of activity on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xbiblio-devel">mailing list</a> of the CSL project. One thing we think we hope Mendeley can help with is reporting usage statistics on specific style files, so at least people can find the most popular version of a CSL file for a given style.</p>
<h3 id="5-where-can-a-user-find-more-csl-citation-styles-is-it-easy-to-modify-a-csl-style">5. Where can a user find (more) CSL citation styles? Is it easy to modify a CSL style?</h3>
<p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: While anyone is free to write and host their own CSL styles, most CSL styles that are in use are available through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.zotero.org/styles">Zotero Style Repository</a> (many of these styles are licensed under a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons license</a>). We have to admit that editing CSL styles currently requires some technical skill and knowledge of XML. This hasn’t kept members of the Zotero user community from creating over a thousand CSL styles, but we do recognize that user friendly editing of styles is a very important feature. We therefore applaud Mendeley’s effort to create an online CSL editor.</p>
<h3 id="6-should-publishers-care-about-csl">6. Should publishers care about CSL?</h3>
<p><strong><strong>Ian Mulvany</strong></strong>: As I pointed out the big publishers don’t care about the submission format, but they have not really done a good job of communicating that to their editorial boards. Smaller publishers don’t have the resources to totally reformat submissions, and beyond academic publishing there are a huge number of people who just need to format citations. There is a huge waste of people’s time in reformatting papers for submissions, in fixing styles according to changing requirements from departments, when what should matter is the content. I’d love to get to a point where every publisher accepted the same type of XML input, and our authoring tools all created content conforming to that input format. Citations should be a DOI or other HTTP URI that can be rendered into the appropriate format using CSL and an API.</p>
<p><em><em>Martin Fenner: The Open Access publishers BioMed Central and PLoS plan to add a CSL style download link to their author instruction pages. I hope that more publishers follow this example.</em></em></p>
<h3 id="7-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-csl">7. Do you want to talk about future plans for CSL?</h3>
<p><strong><strong>Rintze Zelle</strong></strong>: We’re very excited about the work Zotero and Mendeley developers are doing to update their programs to support CSL 1.0. The update path should be relatively smooth for users as styles can be automatically updated to the CSL 1.0 format, although styles will often need to be edited to take full advantage of all the new features. Zotero Everywhere <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/">was announced</a> earlier this week and will include a web citation formatting service based on citeproc-js.</p>
<p>There are two things we consider crucial to the further development of CSL: one, we still lack an easy way for users to modify existing styles, although we’re hopeful that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://bitbucket.org/csledit/csl-wysiwyg-editor/">Mendeley’s CSL editor</a> will soon fill this gap. Secondly, we feel there is a need for a more full-featured online style repository which allows users to find their style of choice, to add comments, and to propose style changes.</p>
<p>The goal of CSL is to make citing formatting easier at a general level, across all fields and in all languages. This can only be achieved through a collaborative endeavor, and here we think publishers also share some responsibility. By providing high quality item metadata through robust standards (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://unapi.info/">unAPI</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a>), by freely providing clear, correct and complete style guidelines or opting for a standard citation style (like APA, Chicago or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525124720/http://www.mhra.org.uk/Publications/Books/StyleGuide/download.shtml">MHRA</a>), and perhaps even by creating and hosting their own CSL styles, publishers can make our work, and that of authors, so much easier.</p>
<p>With broad participation and support, we believe that CSL can benefit all fields of scholarship in a similar way Oren Patashnik’s BibTeX helped the sciences, by (further) streamlining the publication process, improving access to metadata of materials of all kinds, and by allowing scholars to spend more of their time on the core of their research.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Scientist,</p>
<p>last week you published an interesting article by <strong><strong>Christian Specht</strong></strong> about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57689/">Mutations of citations</a>. Dr. Specht found more than 600 wrong citations for the paper by Laemmli (Laemmli 1970), which has been cited at least 88633 times according to Scopus.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Laemmli UK</strong></strong>. Cleavage of Structural Proteins during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4. <em><em>Nature</em></em>. 1970;227:680-685. https://doi.org/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/227680a0">10.1038/227680a0</a></p>
<p>I was intrigued by the “sequence alignment” in Fig. 1a which clearly demonstrated that point mutations at 2<strong><strong>2</strong></strong>7 and 68<strong><strong>0</strong></strong> are particularly common, and that some mutations are inherited between overlapping groups of scientists. Of particular interest is the “complete nonsense mutation” that attributes the citation to the journal <em><em>Science</em></em>.</p>
<p>However, the author failed to demonstrate that the citation mutations had a paper-not-found phenotype or whether they were simply silent mutations. Missing is also an analysis of whether the mutations</p>
<ul>
<li>originated with the paper authors (who by now should all be using reference managers that automatically import citations),</li>
<li>were introduced by the publisher during manuscript production (many journals use tools such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/05/01/extyles-interview-with-elizabeth-blake-and-bruce-rosenblum">eXtyles</a> to check and fix citations in manuscripts), or</li>
<li>first appeared in the scientific databases that stored the citations (Specht used Web of Science).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular interest would be whether there is a decrease in mutation rate over time, as automated tools have increased the fidelity of the citation process, and whether any citation style was particularly prone to mutations (no citation style uses checksums). As a researcher I suggest that the burden of proofreading should rest not with paper authors, and that journal and database publishers invest in appropriate citation repair mechanisms. And please use the DOI, even the paper by Laemmli (Laemmli 1970) has one.</p>

One important strategy he uses is to ask his readers for feedback in regular intervals – he calls it delurking. AJ Cann has picked up the idea, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525131414/http://www.microbiologybytes.com/blog/2010/09/15/you-like/">on Wednesday asked the readers of his blog MicrobiologyBytes</a> a few questions. I like them and have blatantly reused most of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are you and what’s your background?</li>
<li>How long have you been reading Gobbledygook?</li>
<li>Where do you read Gobbledygook – website or RSS?</li>
<li>What do you like best about Gobbledygook?</li>
<li>How could I make Gobbledygook better for you?</li>

<p>It would be kind if you could provide some feedback in the comments section below.</p>

<p>Reading lists are perfect for this, and they are easy to create and maintain with web-based reference managers. Reading lists are used in teaching, e.g. to provide a list of required reading material for a class. But I can also see a number of benefits for science blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>they help the blogger to organize his background material for writing</li>
<li>they help the reader find and keep referenced material</li>
<li>they can provide additional reading not mentioned in the blog post</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several good tools for reading lists. I decided to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>, because what I really want here is a social bookmarking tool that understands references. My Goobledygook reading list is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/group/13987/library">here</a>, the RSS feed is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/rss/group/13987/library">here</a>, and the most recent items in the reading list are also shown in a new sidebar to the right. I started with references to papers, but plan to also include blog posts and other web resources.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/">The Scholarly Kitchen</a> is a group blog started by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://www.sspnet.org/">Society for Scholarly Publishing</a> in 2008. The blog posts by authors Kent Anderson, Phil Davis, David Crotty, Michael Clarke, etc. are an always interesting – and often thought-provoking – read about scholarly publishing. Two recent posts looked at peer review.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/08/31/the-burden-of-peer-review/">The “Burden” of Peer Review</a><br />
In this blog post <strong><strong>David Crotty</strong></strong> argues that we overestimate the amount of time the typical researcher spends doing peer review. In his informal survey most researchers review 1-3 papers per month, and those reviewing many more often do so voluntarily (e.g. because they sit on an editorial board). I haven’t yet checked whether there are any formal surveys on the workload of peer review.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/09/10/post-publication-review-when-the-dialog-of-science-has-become-a-monologue/">Post-publication Review: Is the Dialog of Science Really a Monologue?</a><br />
In August the BMJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c3926">published a paper</a> that looked at the adequacy of author replies to electronic letters to the editor. The cohort study found that authors are reluctant to respond to criticism to their work. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c3803">companion editorial</a>, David Schriger and Douglas Altman write about the possible reasons for this inadequate uptake of post-publication peer review, and that we need a change in culture to value public discussion<em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em> <strong><strong>Philip David</strong></strong> summarized the two papers and concluded that <em><em>post-publication review may continue to be spotty and unreliable</em></em>.</p>
<p>I would disagree with Philip Davis about the conclusions that can be drawn from the cohort study. We all know that many papers receive few if any online comments. But we should rather think about where we could be 3-5 years from now, and how to get there. A recent editorial by Thomas Liesegang in the <em><em>Journal of Ophtalmology</em></em> is very relevant to this discussion (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2009.11.015">Peer review should continue after publication</a>, link via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://ese-bookshelf.blogspot.com/2010/09/b-peer-review-should-continue-after.html">EASE Journal Blog</a>). And Richard Smith gives a wonderful and much broader definition of post-publication peer review in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c3803.full/reply#bmj_el_240798">response</a> to the BMJ editorial:</p>
<blockquote>
I would define post-publication review as the process whereby scientists and others decide whether a piece of work matters or not. I suggest that this doesn’t happen much through debate in the correspondence pages of journals, but rather through scientists and other consumers of research recommending others to pay attention to a piece of research, conducting other studies off the back of it, absorbing it into systematic reviews, beginning to act on its conclusions, throwing it in the bin, and taking a thousand other actions that constitute the “market of ideas.”

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/">Lanyrd</a> is a new social directory for conferences launched just a few days ago. It integrates with Twitter to allow you to list conferences you are organizing, speaking at, attending, or just following. It is a social directory in the sense that everyone can edit this information (I don’t know who started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/science-online-london/">Science Online London 2010</a> page), and that you can see the conferences of your Twitter contacts. Future versions of Lanyrd will do a lot more (you can see some of the upcoming features at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/dconstruct/">dConstruct 2010</a> page), but the site is already useful and just looks gorgeous.</p>

<p>The Lanyrd blog launched yesterday and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/blog/2010/welcome/">the first post</a> contains some interesting background information. Lanyrd is a joint project by web developers and newly-weds Simon Willison and Natalie Downe. They launched Lanyrd from Morocco while on an extended honeymoon and don’t plan to be back to England before the end of next year.</p>
<p>Sites such as <strong><strong>Eventbrite</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Upcoming</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>Slideshare</strong></strong> have been around for a while. Twitter is becoming an increasingly useful tool for conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/12/lanyrd-a-new-twitter-mashup-for-conferences/The%20Great%20Science%20Online%20London%20Tweetup">The Great Science Online London Tweetup</a>). And Lanyrd is one of the nicest examples that I have seen so far that integrates Twitter into a service targeted at conference attendees.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Monday <strong><strong>Jenny Rohn</strong></strong> published a blog post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040917/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/sep/06/peer-review">Peer review is no picnic</a> that concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>So the next time you hear someone asserting that scientists aren’t critical, of their own work or that of their colleagues, remember that if a finding has made its way into a reputable journal, it’s most likely despite every last objection that the researcher and all of his lab-mates could come up with – to say nothing of those nasty peer reviewers.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>
</blockquote>
<p>As always with Jenny’s blog posts, the discussion is as interesting as the blog post itself. Joe Dunckley, Maxine Clarke, Austin Elliott, David Colquhoun, and others wrote thoughtful comments about peer review (the comments are now closed). Peer review is an important topic that I want to write more about on this blog (I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525040917/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/13/the-value-of-peer-review">The Value of Peer Review</a> after attending SciFoo 2009).</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/crossref-contributor-id"><em><em>From Slideshare presentation</em></em></a> <em><em>by Geoff Bilder.</em></em></p>
<p>We then talked about two use cases for ORCID. I started with the manuscript submission scenario (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://www.slideshare.net/mfenner/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy">my Slideshare presentation</a>), and I suggested that a critical mass of journals using ORCID would have these benefits to researchers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced submission work</li>
<li>Automated CVs and publication lists</li>
<li>Find related works by author</li>
<li>Semantic meaning of authorship</li>
</ol>
<p>Semantic meaning of authorship (“corresponding author” or “analyzed microarray data”) is not a goal for the first ORCID release, but an interesting future perspective.</p>
<p>Gudmundur followed with a similar presentation about the research dataset submission scenario (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://www.slideshare.net/gthorisson/thorisson-science-online-london-sep2010">his Slideshare presentation</a>).</p>
<p>The process is similar to journal submission, but interacts with repositories instead of journals. Gudmundur showed how this workflow could integrate the submission of a manuscript and the corresponding research data. He also demonstrated how datasets in repositories associated with a particular author could be discovered with the help of ORCID.</p>
<p>But most of the session was dedicated to discussion. As open data was one of the main themes of the conference, the meaning of “open” in ORCID was one of the topics. We talked about how the identifier ORCID could be combined with authentication such as the OAuth system. Phil Lord wanted a modification of the journal submission use case, in that the ORCIDs of authors should be provided with the manuscript, and not entered in the journal submission system. And we talked about whether ORCID should also be used for blog posts, Wikipedia submissions, Slideshare presentations, etc. – I argued that not everything needs to be attributed and measured (see my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/04/unmeasurable-science/">previous blog post</a>).</p>

<p>Today the ORCID initiative reached another important milestone. ORCID is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://orcid.org/node/166">now an official non-profit organization</a> with a first board of directors. I am looking forward to serve on this board of directors.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 3rd Annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> took place last Friday and Saturday. For me it was again a fantastic event. Matt Brown is collecting all blog posts, pictures, videos, etc. over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/09/05/science-online-london-2010-index-of-blog-posts-videos-photos-and-stuff">this Nature Network post</a>. As one of the organizers of the conference (mainly helping with the program) I was pretty nervous, and I have to admit that I didn’t sleep well Thursday and Friday. And much better Saturday.</p>

<p>One important reason to go to a conference is of course to meet the members of your community in real life. It was great to talk to many old friends again, and to meet for the first time in person people I knew from online interactions (Alex Knoll, Brian Mossop, David Dobbs, Matt Cockerill, Jen Mellinn, William Gunn and Jim Caryl and many others not mentioned here). Of course I also missed several friends that came to the first two conferences.</p>
<p>Of the many impressions of the conference I want to focus on one: <strong><strong>Twitter</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Twitter has of course become a mainstream tool to follow conferences. Microblogging for the 2008 conference happened mainly on FriendFeed (the much better tool for conference microblogging and described in this <em><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">PLoS Comp Biol</a></em></em> paper). Every year has seen an increase in Twitter use, and both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://summarizr.labs.eduserv.org.uk/?hashtag=scio10">ScienceOnline2010</a> (#scio10) in January and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://summarizr.labs.eduserv.org.uk/?hashtag=solo10">last week’s conference</a> produced more than 6000 tweets. Towards the end of the conference on Saturday the #solo10 hashtag was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://twitter.com/scottkeir/status/22986296735">#2 trend</a> for London, right before #happbirthdaybeyonce. People not attending the conference were starting to drop in the conversation. We easily beat mainstream science conferences such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting (#asco10) that I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/06/15/using-twitter-at-the-asco-conference">attended earlier this year</a> (almost 5000 tweets, but more than 30.000 attendees). Also interesting: more than 700 people used the #solo10 hashtag in their tweets, even though the conference had only 250 attendees (at least 140 of them with Twitter accounts, listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://twitter.com/LouWoodley/solo10-attendees">here</a>). And some of those not attending were very active twitterers, particularly Bora Zivkovic (@BoraZ).</p>

</figure>
<p>Simon Cockell has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blog.fuzzierlogic.com/archives/365">created</a> a Wordle with the conference tweets, which gives a good idea of the topics discussed. The word PDF is a good example. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.mjrobbins.net/">Martin Robbins</a> said in the <strong><strong>Rebooting Science Journalism</strong></strong> panel discussion that “The PDF is an insult to science…” (rightfully so), and this resulted in a longer discussion in the Twitter backchannel.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://alicerosebell.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/taking-science-journalism-upstream/">same panel discussion</a> also made the best use of Twitter as integral part of a session. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/https://twitter.com/christineottery">Christine Ottery</a> was monitoring the Twitter feed and provided feedback for the panelists. We used Twitterwalls for most sessions, but the speakers often did not use information.</p>

</figure>
<p><em><em>Flickr photo by Mendeley.com</em></em></p>
<p>Twitter several times was also mentioned as an important discovery tool, and I agree that it has become of the best tools to discover interesting stuff, blog posts, papers, etc. I couldn’t attend the <strong><strong>Recommendation Tools for Scientists</strong></strong> session (with Kevin Emamy and Jason Hoyt), so I don’t know whether Twitter as recommendation tool was discussed there.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to do a more detailed analysis of the #solo10 tweets, e.g. by analyzing which sessions were the most tweeted, what were the most popular keywords and links, or by categorizing tweets into different categories. This could make an interesting session at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/2011_Program_Suggestions">ScienceOnline2011</a> Conference next January – of course using some of the cool data visualization tricks that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.davidmccandless.com/">David McCandless</a> showed us in his session.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday PLoS BLOGs launched with a splash. We (both PLoS BLOGs as a whole and me individually) got a lot of positive feedback and words of encouragement – so we are off to a good start. As both our community manager Brian Mossop and myself are currently in London for the Science Online London Conference, we could celebrate the launch in person. With a good pint of British ale Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about something that is sticking in my head since a conversation a few weeks ago with some friends (all esteemed professors in biology or medicine) over another beer. And this has of course been discussed before, both on this blog and elsewhere. Doing science is not only about doing exciting research, and communicating the results to your peers and the public. Measuring scientific output – of funded research projects, a particular researcher, or an institution – seems to be equally important. I would argue that in recent years this has even become the most important aspect of doing science. The successful researcher of today is not necessarily a brilliant mind, skillful experimenter or successful communicator, but a good manager of science. Grants need to be written, collaborations and networks built and maintained, and papers published.</p>
<p>This is all good and well in the sense that researchers should be held accountable for how they are using their funding, often from public sources. And we want to fund the right projects, i.e. those that have the highest likelihood of achieving something new and exciting. But there are two very big problems with this:</p>
<h3 id="we-don-t-really-know-how-to-evaluate-science-particularly-in-numbers-that-can-be-used-to-compare-research-projects-">We don’t really know how to evaluate science, particularly in numbers that can be used to compare research projects.</h3>
<p>This problem is aggravated by the fact that funding (and hiring) decisions are predictions based on past performance. Excellent science by definition is new and groundbreaking, and predicting scientific progress is really hard to do. The past performance of a researcher, the research environment he is working in (colleagues, scientific equipment, etc.), and of course the project outline written down in the proposal are all very helpful. But can we really  predict the next Nature or Cell paper before a project has even started? And the evaluation of scientific output is also extremely difficult. Do you just look at published papers? And if so, how do you evaluate the scientific impact of those papers? Through peer review? By the number of times they were cited? Citation counts have several problems, one of them is the fact that they take a few years to accumulate. The journal a paper is published in? How good an indicator of the impact of the individual paper is that? Should you rather look at download counts or other article-level metrics? We need to think much more about these important issues, as our funding (and hiring) decisions depend on it. I am very happy that I was invited to a workshop by the National Science Foundation this November that will talk about some of these issues. Unique digital author identifiers will play an increasing role in our efforts to tackle the technical aspects of this problem, and I will say something about the ORCID initiative.</p>
<h3 id="the-evaluation-of-science-is-taking-up-more-and-more-of-our-time-that-is-then-missing-time-for-doing-research-">The evaluation of science is taking up more and more of our time that is then missing time for doing research.</h3>
<p>Before the first experiment is even started, a project has taken months or sometimes even years of grant writing and grant reviewing. The regulatory requirements are also increasing, and in the case of clinical research involving patients (something I do) can be overwhelming. After a research project is finished, paper writing and reviewing (and writing a report for the funding agency) again takes many months. In the end it might have taken us two years to do the experiments, but five years from beginning to end of the project.</p>
<p>If we want researchers to do more research – and less grant writing, manuscript writing and peer reviewing (because all this output has to be evaluated by someone), we have to ask funding organizations and institutions to do something about this. There are many possible solutions, and some of them have already been realized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grants can be given for longer periods of time, e.g. 5 years instead of 3 years</li>
<li>The review of grants could just look at the researcher, and doesn’t try to predict scientific discoveries based on the proposed work</li>
<li>Smaller grants, e.g. less than $50.000 don’t need to have a concluding report, a link to a paper published with the results should be enough. Similarly we might need fewer progress reports in larger grants.</li>
<li>Many aspects of grant and paper writing could be made less time-consuming by standardization and automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of potential in the last point, and the workflow is broken at many points. Why do researchers have to list their publications in their CV, this information is publicly available? Why does every funding organization want a slightly different format for their grant proposals, can’t we standardize this? Why don’t we have better paper writing tools? Microsoft Word doesn’t really now about the different required sections for a manuscript and is far from perfect for collaborative writing.</p>
<p>But I have to stop writing now, the second day of the Science Online London Conference is about to begin. I’m wearing my new PLoS BLOGs T-shirt and look forward to another great conference day. I will write about the conference in a separate post in the next fews, but for now let’s just say this conference is even better than in 2009.</p>

<p><em><em>Flickr photo by {Away until inspiration comes}.</em></em></p>
<p>In his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.plos.org/blog/2010/08/31/the-niche-blog-network-lessons-from-the-past-visions-for-the-future/">introductory post</a>, PLoS community manager Brian Mossop talks about how PLoS Blogs came to life, and the lessons learned from other blogging networks. For me personally it all started a few weeks ago with a phone call one Friday evening from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.php#pbinfield">Pete Binfield</a>, Publisher of PLoS ONE and the PLoS Community Journals.</p>
<p>Since August 2007 and until today I was blogging over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner">Nature Network</a>. The focus of that blog was how the internet is changing scientific publishing. This is obviously a very broad topic. A lot of my blog posts looked at rather technical aspects, including new products and services (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/29/elsevier-launches-sciverse-integrates-sciencedirect-scopus-more">last post</a> was about Elsevier’s SciVerse that launched last weekend).</p>
<p>I will continue to write about the same topics. I particularly like to continue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/31/bye-bye-nature-network">interviews</a>, and I want to write more recipes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club</a>). Of course I also want to try different things, e.g. shorter blog posts of interesting stuff I find (something I currently post on Twitter). Please contact me if you have something related to scientific publishing that you want me to write about.</p>
<p>PLoS Blogs is not the only new science blogging network. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/aug/31/blogging-digital-media">Guardian Science Blogs</a> launched just yesterday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scientopia.org/blogs/">Scientopia</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.science3point0.com/blogs/">Science 3.0</a> in the last few weeks. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scienceblogging.org/2010/08/19/some-thoughts-about-science-blog-aggregation/">Scienceblogging.org</a>, an aggregator of science blogs (to keep track of all those great blog posts), was launched by Anton Zuiker, Bora Zivkovic and Dave Munger two weeks ago.</p>
<p>This is a good week for science blogging for another reason. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> takes place this Friday and Saturday. Most relevant to the launch of PLoS Blogs is the panel discussion Friday afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel2">The state of science blogging?</a></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643im_/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/graphics/logo.gif" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>There will of course be other exciting sessions. The panel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel1">“Rebooting” (aka the future of) science journalism</a> with David Dobbs, Ed Yong, Martin Robbins and Alice Bell should be a lot of fun. The closing panel discussion on Saturday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel3">If you build it, will they come?</a> will look at the adoption (or lack thereof) of  Web 2.0 tools for scholarly communication, based on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/communicating-and-disseminating-research/use-and-relevance-web-20-researchers">recent report</a> by the Research Information Network. And a number of sessions focus on open data, a trending topic I’m personally very interested in. Together with Geoff Bilder and Gudmundur Thorisson I will moderate a session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#breakout11">ORCID as unique author identifier: what is it good for and should we worry or be happy?</a></p>
<p>Most importantly, Science Online London is a great opportunity to meet many of my fellow science bloggers in person, and this includes Brian Mossop, the PLoS Blogs community manager. Expect more reports from Science Online London in the next few days, for more up to date information please follow me on Twitter (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://twitter.com/mfenner">@mfenner</a>, conference hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23solo10">#solo10</a>) or try the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.science3point0.com/solo10-2/">video stream</a> put together by Graham Steel.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my last post for this Nature Network blog. Later today, I will start a new blog somewhere else – also called Gobbledygook and covering the same topics.</p>
<p>Writing this blog here on Nature Network since August 2007 has been an incredible experience, something that can't be covered in a single blog post. I simply want to say thank you to all the people I interacted with over the years – both online and in person. And a particular thanks for Matt, Corie, Anna and Lou from Nature Network who made all this possible.</p>

<p>There are several of my posts I particularly like – and some I like a little less. Something I really enjoyed doing – and something that I think works very well in the blog format – is interviews. I did around 20 interviews in the last two years (the last two on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055619/http://lindau.nature.com/">Lindau Laureate Meeting</a> blog), and I've listed them all below.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elsevier on Saturday launched SciVerse, the new Elsevier platform that combines <em><em>ScienceDirect</em></em> (full-text journal articles) and <em><em>Scopus</em></em> (abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature)....]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Elsevier on Saturday launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://info.sciverse.com/">SciVerse</a>, the new Elsevier platform that combines <em><em>ScienceDirect</em></em> (full-text journal articles) and <em><em>Scopus</em></em> (abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature). In 2011 <em><em>SciTopics</em></em> (research summaries) will also be integrated and outside developers will be able to build SciVerse <em><em>applications</em></em> (Elsevier and 3rd party tools that integrate with ScienceDirect and Scopus). Current users of Scopus and ScienceDirect can continue to use these services or access them from the SciVerse platform.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/sciverse.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Both the ScienceDirect and Scopus service are not available this evening, put the new SciVerse functionality should be available in a few hours. As I had no access to SciVerse prior to the launch today, I will need a few days to have a closer look at both the integration of existing products, and the new features. But obviously missing from the announcement is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.2collab.com/">2collab</a>, Elsevier's social bookmarking service that integrates with Scopus and ScienceDirect.</p>
<p>Reference managers a few years ago started to store the PDFs of fulltext articles associated with a citation. It is no surprise to see the same trend from developers of abstracts databases. The integration of Scopus with ScienceDirect almost looks like Elsevier's answer to PubMed/PubMed Central. The recently launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK PubMed Central</a> is doing a particularly nice job integrating abstracts and fulltext articles.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of SciVerse is the possibility for 3rd party developers to access the service via APIs and to develop both free and commercial applications. We will see whether SciVerse develops into an open platform that works with other publishers, funders and institutions, or whether SciVerse will become a very large data silo. Elsevier's Rafael Sidi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.researchinformation.info/features/feature.php?feature_id=255">writes</a> that <em><em>Open data and open APIs offer huge opportunities for research and innovation</em></em>, and earlier this week Mendeley's Jason Hoyt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/open-access/researcher-which-side-of-history/">wrote</a> something similar. Data is also at the heart of the business models of many web-based companies – let's hope that these two interests don't collide.</p>

</ul>
<p>The main arguments against supplementary information are that it overburdens reviewers (and in turn authors), and it counteracts the concept of a self-contained research report. The main argument for supplementary information is that sometimes essential information can’t be provided within the context of a journal article (e.g. video, large datasets), especially in those journals that still have print editions. Several blog posts emphasized that supplementary information is particularly important to provide the research data with the article. I think that Heather Piwowar’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">post</a> is the best discussion of the relevant issues.</p>
<p>I’m obviously two weeks late with this blog posts, but I have been on vacation, and I’m only slowly catching up with all the interesting discussions that have happened while I was away. I think the discussion of supplementary information is very important, because it really is a discussion of our concept of a scientific paper. And this concept is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like">changing rapidly</a> for many reasons, including the push to mobile platforms, and the wish by many to publish multimedia files (e.g. 3D structures) and research data with a paper.</p>
<p><em>Phil Bourne: Beyond the PDF.</em></p>
<p>It appears to me that we haven’t talked much about supplementary information, and it really has been something everybody was doing out of necessity, without too much thinking about many of the issues, including standard formats, problems for users finding and storing this supplementary information, and copyright issues.</p>
<p>Most journals have (often similar) instructions regarding supplementary information, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Supplementary Information is peer-reviewed material directly relevant to the conclusion of a paper that cannot be included in the printed version for reasons of space or medium. –</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/submissions/final/suppinfo.html">Nature</a></li>
<li><em>Although BMC Medicine does not restrict the length and quantity of data in a paper, there may still be occasions where an author wishes to provide data sets, tables, movie files, or other information as additional information.</em> – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed/ifora/">BMC Medicine</a></li>
<li><em>Supplemental Information may include additional control data, validation of methods and reagents, primary data, nonprintable media files, or large data sets. It can also include detailed information regarding Experimental Procedures, including materials (oligonucleotides, plasmids, strains, etc.).</em> – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.cell.com/supplemental_information_guide">Cell</a></li>
<li><em>We strongly encourage authors to include such things as videos, 3-D structures/images, sequence alignments and data sets that are very large, such as those obtained with microarray hybridization experiments. –</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.jbc.org/site/misc/ifora.xhtml#supplemental_data">J Biol Chem</a></li>
<li><em>We encourage authors to submit essential supporting files and multimedia files along with their manuscripts. All supporting material will be subject to peer review. –</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.plosone.org/static/guidelines.action">PLoS ONE</a></li>
<li><em>Science does not accept as supporting online material HTML files including JavaScript or other scripting languages or Cascading Style Sheets, PowerPoint presentations, and TeX or LaTeX files.</em> – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.sciencemag.org/about/authors/prep/prep_online.dtl#submit">Science</a></li>
<li><em>Instead of appearing in the printed version of the journal, supporting information is posted on the PNAS Web site at the time of publication. SI is referred to in the text and cannot be altered by authors after acceptance. –</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/iforc.shtml#x">PNAS</a></li>
<li><em>The amount of online-only material should be limited and justified. Online-only material should be original and not previously published. –</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://jama.ama-assn.org/misc/ifora.dtl#OnlineOnlyMaterial">JAMA</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The announcement of the <em><em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></em> will hopefully initiate a broader discussion of the usefulness and best format of supplementary information. The most interesting aspect for me and several of the bloggers discussing the announcement is the publication of the research data associated with a paper. For now supplementary information is often the only place these data can be published, but there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">many reasons</a> why this is not the best idea in the long run.</p>
<p>[^1]: This is a perfect example for why we need better systems to track blog posts relating to an article. We have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature Blogs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://streamosphere.nature.com/">Streamosphere</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.ubervu.com/conversations/www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/30/32/10599">UberVu</a> (and probably others) but they are far from perfect.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his new book <em><em>Cognitive Surplus</em></em> Clay Shirky argues that in the last 50 years many of those living in industrialized countries have seen a dramatic increase in free time, paired with better education and a higher standard of living. But a very large part of that free time or cognitive surplus is now routinely used to watch television, a passive activity that makes us a consumer rather than a participant. In a trend that is also true for other media (eg. music), we have seen a shift away from participation (usually on an amateur level) towards consuming professionally produced media content.</p>
<p>In the last few years we have seen a dramatic change in Internet technologies that now make it extremely easy for everybody to produce content and distribute it on the Internet (e.g. Wikipedia, blogs, photos on Flickr, or YouTube videos) something we usually call Web 2.0 or social media. Clay Shirky contrasts the time that users spend editing <em><em>Wikipedia</em></em> (or other social media activities) with the hours we typically watch television to kill the argument that most of us would have no time for social media.</p>
<p>The combination of increased free time and social media is creating a lot of interesting collaborative projects, and the book is full of interesting examples. Clay Shirky stresses that social media only enable new uses of the cognitive surplus, it is how they are used that decides whether we create personal, communal, public or civic values. He uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.icanhazcheeseburger.com/">ICanHazCheeseburger</a> (a popular website that shows cute pictures of cats with cute captions) as an example for communal value, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.apache.org/">Apache Webserver</a> Open Source software project as an example of public value, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi.com</a> (a site started to allow citizens to track outbreaks of ethnic violence in Kenya) as an example of civic value.</p>
<p>Social media in the context of science and medicine are discussed briefly in the book. Clay Shirky describes the <em><em>Invisible College</em></em>, a group formed around 1645 in London by Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and others that established many of the principles of conducting science that are still valid today (test every hypothesis with experiments, describe experiments detailed enough so that they could be reproduced, etc.). The group formed the core of what a little later became the <em><em>Royal Society</em></em>. Clay Shirky argues that the collaborative nature of how science was conducted by the Invisible College lead to a dramatic increase in our scientific knowledge and contrasts this with how alchemy was performed at the time (reclusive and secretive).</p>
<p>Clay Shirky also talks about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201437/http://www.patientslikeme.com/">PatientsLikeMe.com</a>, a site that allows patients with chronic diseases to share their health information, both for personal advice, but also as participants in clinical trials. Patients Like Me only works because patients are willing to share their personal healthcare information, and that is a cultural shift from the strict privacy that usually surrounds information about your personal health. Patients participating in Patients Like Me obviously think that the benefits from sharing their personal healthcare information outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Cognitive Surplus is very entertaining reading, and on almost every page Clay Shirky gives us food for thought that will keep us busy for days or weeks. The book is required reading for everybody who is interested in how social media are changing the way we consume, communicate, and conduct science. After finishing the book, you will no longer think that the scientific article of the future is primarily about integration of video or other multimedia, intelligent navigation, or display on mobile devices. The successful journals of the future will be those that work hardest in facilitating collaboration among scientists, and this requires cultural changes as much as it requires technological changes.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201336/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html">announced last week</a> that they will stop further development of Google Wave, and essentially shut down the service by the end of the year. Some of the more exciting parts of Wave will be reused in other Google products or – since many parts of Google Wave have been made available under an Open Source license, in products by other companies. But the announcement is an admission that the adoption by users and developers had not been what Google had hoped for with this very ambitious project.</p>
<p>Google Wave was first announced at Google I/O in May 2009, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201336/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/18/using-google-wave-for-a-week-its-still-great">I had a Google Wave account</a> since July 2009 thanks to being invited to the SciFoo conference (where every attendee got one of those then still rare Wave invites). Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201336/http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-triumph-of-document-layout-and-the-demise-of-google-wave/">others</a>, I saw the tremendous potential to improve on existing tools for researchers to collaborate. But after 12 months, Google Wave hasn't replaced email as communication tool in at least some of my collaborations. Many people have pointed out the reasons for the lack of user adoption of Google Wave. I want to focus on something else: Google Wave tried to solve a problem that is very relevant to scientists, and we still don't have a solution for that problem.</p>
<p>Email has become the primary tool for many scientists to collaborate with colleagues both within the same institution, and between different institutions. Despite this popularity, email and the typical workflow around it has several significant shortcomings:</p>
<p><em><em>Email is not good in tracking longer conversations between more than two people.</em></em> Even though email messages can be grouped together, it quickly becomes difficult to follow the discussion. And it is even more complicated for those joining the discussion later.</p>
<p><em><em>Email is not good in sharing documents.</em></em> Sending large documents repeatedly back and forth is not only a waste of network bandwidth and limited email storage capacities, but is also not a very productive way to collaboratively work on a longer document, as it quickly becomes difficult to merge the different document versions together.</p>
<p><em><em>Word processors are not good tools to write scientific documents.</em></em> Traditional word processors such as Microsoft Word or LaTeX care too much about document formatting, and still approach a document primarily as something an individual user edits on a single computer.</p>
<p>Maybe user uptake for Google Wave was low because the approach to tackle these problems was too radical. Many other, less radical tools try to solve the same problems, including mailing lists, wikis, social bookmarking sites such as CiteULike, collaborative writing tools such as Google Docs, and project management tools such as Basecamp.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Because most of the technology behind Google Wave has been made available, we could continue to use and develop Google Wave and Wave extensions for scientists. But that is a very risky strategy that not many people would follow. We can also wait for new tools that help scientists collaborate, and there interesting products announced every few months. For the time being I will continue trying to convince my colleagues to use some of the existing tools instead of email where appropriate, something that is surprisingly difficult.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reference management is a frequent topic on this blog. The last few years we have seen both a large increase in the number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/03/15/reference-manager-overview">available tools</a>, but also big changes in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/19/post">how we use reference management software</a>. But for many of us the first reference management software was Endnote.</p>
<p>I first used Endnote as a medical student in 1990 (Endnote Plus at that time, published by Niles Software), and I’m still a regular user. I can’t say that for many other programs (probably also Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint, Adobe Photoshop, SPSS and until recently Freehand). The latest version – Endnote X4 – was just released/is about to be released (Windows in June, Macintosh in August). This is a good opportunity to look at how Endnote has changed over the years and why it is still such a popular application. For this I interviewed <em><em>Jason Rollins</em></em>, who is leading the Endnote development team.</p>

<h3 id="1-what-is-endnote">1. What is EndNote?</h3>
<p>Researchers around the world depend on EndNote to simplify collaboration, reference collection, and bibliography formatting. It is these researchers who have molded the EndNote you see today, allowing us to address the pain points as technology evolves. While EndNote originated on the Macintosh and Windows desktops, users now have the added combination of the Web where they can transfer reference groups and share them with colleagues easily. EndNote connects to many parts of the research landscape including online resources for both basic bibliographic information and full text, word processors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</a> for uniquely identifying personal works that will dovetail into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> initiative as well as decreasing time to publish when submitting EndNote formatted documents into publishing systems.</p>
<h3 id="2-how-is-endnote-different-from-other-reference-managers">2. How is EndNote different from other reference managers?</h3>
<p>EndNote defined reference management software for generations of researchers and continues to offer the highest quality formatting available in any tool. Today some variation of the core functionality – searching, organizing, sharing, and citing of scholarly reference material – is available in many competing tools.</p>
<p>Two key differences between EndNote and other reference management tools include gathering and formatting references. First, EndNote is far more accurate and flexible when it comes to the variety of publishing styles it supports. EndNote not only provides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/support/enstyles.asp">over 4,500 formatting styles</a> but it also allows for the most control and customization of this formatting. Our EndNote team works closely with leading publishers and editors across many academic disciplines to ensure that EndNote offers the formatting control our users need to meet exacting publisher specifications. Most of the power of this formatting is built-in and achieved automatically by EndNote – without the user having to think about it. Of course there are many customization options too; these allow users to easily make changes and tweaks to the way EndNote formats citations, footnotes, and bibliographies.</p>
<p>Second, EndNote offers the best options for easy import and export of user data. The Online Search, Find Full Text, importing, and Web capture options are all features that make it easy to obtain accurate bibliographic information and manage full text data in EndNote. The “RIS Tagged Data” format has become a de facto standard for hundreds of databases and software tools. Plus, the EndNote XML specification is something that is openly shared with partners and competitors alike in hopes of making it easier for our customers to move their data into and out of any system they may need to use.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-is-new-in-endnote-x4">3. What is new in EndNote X4?</h3>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/enx4wnvid/Whats_New-SD.asp">longer list of new and improved features</a>, but a few of the key features are new PDF functions, better support for collaborative writing and more robust footnote handling.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/endnote_screenshot.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>EndNote X4 can create records from PDFs using metadata and a DOI, attaching the original file to the newly created reference. Then, PDFs are further incorporated into users’ libraries by indexing the attached files and making them searchable along with the reference data.</p>
<p>The connection between EndNote and a word processor is more visible by incorporating cited references from documents right into the EndNote interface. This way, users can work with their references in a word processor, and focus on the references in a particular paper while managing things in EndNote. Editing and managing individual citations in Word now combines all the functionality in one place which is a big help for people working on large projects, or collaboratively. The “Traveling Library” sharing feature in Word has also been significantly improved to help people work together. The APA 6th style is fully supported and EndNote X4 offers much more customization and intelligence to the way footnote formatting styles are handled.</p>
<p>The full list of features, online videos, and a free trial version of EndNote X4 are available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/">www.endnote.com</a>. EndNote version X4 was released in June for Windows with the Macintosh version available by the end of this summer.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-does-endnote-handle-pdf-management-can-you-share-pdf-files-with-other-users">4. How does EndNote handle PDF management? Can you share PDF files with other users?</h3>
<p>With version X4, we have added more PDF-related functionality to EndNote. Now, you can import PDF meta-data and search the full text of attached PDF files. You can share EndNote library files that contain PDF attachments easily – or any other file type. EndNote Web does not currently support direct file attachments but this is something we are currently working on.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-is-endnote-web-how-does-it-relate-to-endnote">5. What is EndNote Web, how does it relate to EndNote?</h3>
<p>EndNote provides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnoteweb.com/">EndNote Web</a> to users for easy sharing and collaboration features. Transferring references up to the web provides extra flexibility to work with EndNote references anywhere. There’s a browser plug-in available with EndNote Web, that captures and saves references from web pages and allows users to send references to a desktop or web-based library. The web version has some features that the desktop doesn’t, and vice versa; each is complimentary to the other. EndNote Web is also integrated into the Web of Knowledge database platform and a limited version of EndNote Web is provided to ResearcherID users for managing their personal publication list.</p>
<h3 id="6-can-i-use-endnote-with-collaborative-writing-tools-such-as-google-docs-or-microsoft-office-live">6. Can I use EndNote with collaborative writing tools such as Google Docs or Microsoft Office Live?</h3>
<p>While we do not have any custom built plug-ins or similar tools for Google Docs or Microsoft Office Live, as always, it’s easy to drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste in EndNote citations. If you look closely at other products that claim to be compatible, you’ll see that they are offering a simple copy and paste function as well. Based on our research thus far, these writing tools do not yet offer the right APIs to build more robust integration. This is something we hear from customers quite often so we will keep an eye on developments and hope to offer something more once the APIs are available.</p>
<h3 id="7-how-does-endnote-help-with-reference-management-beyond-writing-manuscripts-e-g-reading-lists-for-students-writing-blog-posts-etc-">7. How does EndNote help with reference management beyond writing manuscripts, e.g reading lists for students, writing blog posts, etc.?</h3>
<p>You can easily use EndNote to include citations, hyperlinks, or any other reference data into nearly any type of document in almost any format and customize the output for your specific needs. You can share groups of references with both read only and read-write access; this supports sharing reading lists and more involved collaboration. But, reference management has evolved into so much more than just finding things to insert into a document. With the grouping, searching, and file attachment options, EndNote is a way to organize the majority of your research. These features make EndNote robust and flexible at handling a huge volume of items. Plus, you’ve always been able to store files of any type with EndNote, therefore making it possible to utilize much of the organizational capabilities for non-traditional sources like video clips or datasets.</p>
<h3 id="8-endnote-has-seen-many-updates-since-its-initial-release-more-than-20-years-ago-what-do-you-see-as-some-of-the-most-significant-changes-during-that-time">8. EndNote has seen many updates since its initial release more than 20 years ago. What do you see as some of the most significant changes during that time?</h3>
<p>EndNote started out for the Mac Plus and DOS; so clearly a lot has changed along with many of the major developments in personal software technology since the late 1980′s. EndNote introduced online searching and direct export to simplify the movement of references from discovery to a personal collection for citing in papers. Cite While You Write is often imitated but never duplicated for ease of use when citing references in Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, and OpenOffice.org Writer. The fundamental problem that EndNote has been solving for our customers has morphed over the years. While keeping up with changes in formatting rules and reference types, which have always been the core strength of EndNote, we have also evolved EndNote into a more complete reference management solution. Where at one time the majority of our users worked alone on a single computer writing a static manuscript, today most customers interact with a global network of collaborators on multiple projects that might be delivered in several formats. Now with EndNote Web and ResearcherID, EndNote users can easily promote their work and connect with others. Another area that has significantly changed over the last twenty years is the means by which users access research material, and as our user’s focus has shifted from basic reference data and description to inclusion of the full text of sources and supporting documentation, EndNote has too. EndNote supports this with OpenURL linking, proxy and open source authentication, browser plug-ins, and other functions.</p>
<p>Many of the developments we currently have underway will further support online sharing and connectivity and should prove to be some of the most valuable including mobile functionality and more.</p>
<h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-thomson-reuters">9. What are your responsibilities at Thomson Reuters?</h3>
<p>My team is responsible for the development of bibliographic management tools. This involves leading the development teams for EndNote and Reference Manager, listening to customer input, and coordinating partnerships.</p>
<h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-working-at-thomson-reuters">10. What did you do before working at Thomson Reuters?</h3>
<p>I joined the EndNote team in 2001. Before that, I was completing a PhD in Educational Technology from Drexel University and working for two different consulting firms and a small web start-up.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> is a <em><em>personalized social magazine</em></em> for the iPad. The free application was released on July 22, and instantly created a lot of buzz. Because of the overwhelming interest, they had to create a waitlist for the personal features and I could only sign up for and start using them a few days ago. Flipboard is a true iPad application, it would not work the same on a laptop computer or mobile phone.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard3.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Flipboard allows you to set up nine sections for different content. You can select them from a predefined list, but the really interesting part is to create your own sections from Twitter users or Twitter lists:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard4.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>You can also create a section with all the Twitter accounts you follow. Flipboard will display Tweets in a visually pleasing way. Flipboard doesn't display all Tweets in your Twitter timeline, but filters the most popular and interesting tweets.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard1.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>But Flipboard does something else. Rather than just displaying tweets, it follows the links provided in your Twitter stream and displays that information (photos, YouTube videos, blog posts, etc.). It can't handle all the links and for example has problems with links to FriendFeed (very common in my Twitter feed).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard2.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>To filter the information, you can also create sections from Twitter lists (or individual users). I had created lists with Science Journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/mfenner/science-journals">@mfenner/science-journals</a>) and Nature Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/mfenner/nature-network">@mfenner/nature-network</a>) bloggers in the past.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard5.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Twitter lists are great for following meetings (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/BoraZ/scienceonline2010">@BoraZ/scienceonline2010</a>), but unfortunately Flipboard doesn't yet allow to create sections from Twitter hashtags (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034/https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23scifoo">#scifoo</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard6.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>When you click on an individual entry, you will see a longer text, and also Tweets referring to that time as well as a link to the full-text article.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard7.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Flipboard does something similar with your Facebook News Feed. It is important to understand that Flipboard is not an RSS reader, but rather a visually pleasing aggregator from News in your Twitter and Facebook networks. Flipboard doesn't present all the information in these networks, but rather filters the most popular and “interesting” stuff.</p>
<p>How is Flipboard relevant to reading scholarly papers? It can be used out of the box for journals that tweet their table of contents or at least the most interesting papers. And everybody can create a Twitter account that retweets interesting papers in a particular subject area or from a particular institution (ideally this should be integrated with a bookmarking tool such as CiteULike). Scientific publishers could also work with Flipboard to integrate their content (you see in the example above that the scraping used by flipboard sometimes isn't perfect). Almost all scientific papers have an abstract. The abstract would display well in Flipboard, and could then link to the full text at the journal site.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140034im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/flipboard8.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p><em><em>To get started reading science blogs on Flipboard, add a ResearchBlogging.org section by subscribing to the @ResearchBlogs Twitter account.</em></em></p>
<p>Flipboard is of course also a great tool to follow science blogs. It probably works best if a new Twitter account is set up just for that purpose. This account could announce all new posts from a particular blog, or about a particular topic. Twitter lists could then be used for blogging networks such as <em><em>Nature Network</em></em> or <em><em>Scienceblogs.com</em></em>. Flipboard would also work very well to cover the blogging and tweeting of scientific conferences. With all these activities we will very soon need more than the nine sections that Flipboard supports.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few days we have seen a number of blog posts reflecting on the pros and cons of science blogging networks. Bora Zivkovic last week announced his departure from scienceblogs.com, and in his must-read post reflected on the history of science blogging (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/07/scienceblogs_and_me_and_the_ch.php">A Farewell to Scienceblogs: the Changing Science Blogging Ecosystem</a>). Richard Grant on Saturday wrote down his thoughts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/2010/07/24/on-nature-network">On Nature Network</a>. Cameron Neylon draws an interesting parallel between science networks and scientific journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-nature-of-science-blog-networks/">The Nature of Science Blog Networks</a>). And Katherine Haxton compared her experience blogging on Nature Network vs. blogging on her own blog (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.possibilitiesendless.com/?p=270">Science Blogging Networks</a>).</p>
<p>My thoughts on this: it's complicated. I don't see how blogging networks (or any particular network) can be inherently better or worse than setting up your own blog. It's an individual decision. Right now I like to write as part of a blogging network. But I may change my mind and write for a different network, or on an individually hosted blog. I would like to add three considerations to the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="consider-institutional-blogs">Consider institutional blogs</h3>
<p>We shouldn't forget that there is also a third alternative to blogging networks and individually hosted blogs: a blog hosted by your institution. An institutional blog has a different set of advantages and disadvantages and is therefore not the right choice for everybody. But I will soon start an official blog for the cancer center of my medical school (I've gotten the green light from administration and the PR department, the WordPress 3.0 test system is set up, but it probably will be a few weeks before the first post). I have no intentions stopping the Gobbledygook blog – the new blog will have a different focus, and it will be in German. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://network.nature.com/profile/rpg">Richard</a> have written institutional blogs for years, but this will be new for me – and will also be the first official blog at our university.</p>
<h3 id="we-need-a-better-aggregator-for-science-blogs">We need a better aggregator for science blogs</h3>
<p>Most of us probably have subscribed to a good number of science blogs with an RSS reader. The best way to find interesting new posts is probably through links in blogs we read regularly. In addition, we stumble upon interesting posts via links in blog networks, blog rolls, <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, or shared items in <em><em>Google Reader</em></em>.</p>
<p>In addition, we also need a good aggregator of science blogs. I have to admit that I have stopped using <em><em>Technorati</em></em> a while ago. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/">Nature.com Blogs</a> was a good start, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging</a> does a good job of covering blog posts about peer-reviewed literature. But we probably can do much better. Whether the best strategy would be to put more resources into one of the existing services (see also Lou's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/2010/07/24/on-nature-network#comment-61864">comment</a> from earlier today), or whether to start building something new, I don't know. But there is a lot of potential for building a better discovery service that at the same time will become an interesting archive of what the science blogosphere is talking about. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/20/streamosphere-interview-with-euan-adie">Streamosphere</a> is already a good step in the right direction.</p>

<h3 id="personal-interactions-are-important">Personal interactions are important</h3>
<p>It is usually much more rewarding to interact with someone online whom you have also met in person. This is true not only for scientific collaborations, but of course also for social media. This is obviously much easier if you live in places like London, but even Hannover (where I live) has a really nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/11/action-points">Science 2.0 community</a>. And this is why science blogging conferences such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/">ScienceOnline2010</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102940/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London 2010</a> are so important. Science Online London is only six weeks away (September 3-4 at the British Library), and I'm really excited not only about the program, but also because of all the people I will for the first time or again meet in person.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago I wrote a blog post about how to use Web 2.0 tools for a journal club (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club</a>). Although reference management tools such as <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> and <em><em>Mendeley</em></em> can be used for journal clubs, discussion features are often more of an afterthought. At the time I therefore recommended FriendFeed. In February of this year, ScienceFeed was released (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/15/sciencefeed-interview-with-ijad-madisch">ScienceFeed: Interview with Ijad Madisch</a>). It is very similar to FriendFeed, but is smarter about finding and storing references to scientific literature. Unfortunately ScienceFeed integrates very tightly with ResearchGate. You have to sign up for both services to use the reference management features.</p>
<p>Last week a new web-based tool specifically for Journal Clubs was released. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/">JournalFire</a> was created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/johnmdelacruz">John Delacruz</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/riccardoschmid">Riccardo Schmid</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/timhill">Tim Hill</a>. JournalFire is free for public discussion groups, but costs money for private groups with more than 4 members.</p>

<p>Feel free to participate in the discussion about this article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://journalfire.com/node/70269107">here</a>. I've picked a paper that is not only freely available and nicely written, but also in a very hot field.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-like">What I like</h3>
<p>JournalFire really focuses on discussion around a paper. Journal Clubs are used to organize the discussion, similar to groups in other tools. The interface is uncluttered, and almost everything is available as RSS feed.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-would-like">What I would like</h3>
<p>JournalFire was just released publicly, so it obviously doesn't have all the features of a more mature product. More importantly, JournalFire covers a fairly specific reference management niche, it is therefore important that data exchange with other reference management tools is as easy as possible.<br />
JournalFire has a bookmarklet similar to what other reference managers offer, and you can export one or more references in Endnote or BibTex format. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</a> support should be an obvious addition, and an API would allow tighter integration with other tools, e.g. to add Journal Club features to your CiteULike, Mendeley or Zotero library.</p>
<p>The Journal Club concept of JournalFire fills a very interesting niche. But in the end, social tools for scientists are about critical mass. It will be interesting to see whether JournalFire can attract enough users in this very crowded market.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I attended the fabulous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.open.ac.uk/telstar/event">Innovations in Reference Management</a> workshop in Birmingham organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.twitter.com/ostephens">Owen Stephens</a> from Open University. Owen has written <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/telstar/tag/irm10/">some blog posts</a> summarizing the sessions almost in real time. You also find a good number of interesting tweets under the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23irm10">#irm10</a>. My presentation was called <em><em>Trends in Reference Management</em></em>:</p>
<p>I started my presentation by giving a brief historical perspective on how reference management has evolved during the past 25 years. It seems as if many users today use reference managers the same way as users did in 1992 (when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci00010a601">this review of Endnote</a> was written): a database of (mostly) journal articles installed on your desktop computer that can fetch references directly from online databases (in 1992 we had Endlink and the Z39.50 protocol for that) and that inserts bibliographies into Microsoft Word. It is odd that many seemingly old problems still exist today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Object Identifiers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.doi.org/">DOIs</a>) were introduced in 2000, and many journals not only are using them, but also exist only as electronic versions. Nevertheless most citation styles still use volumes, issues and page numbers instead of the DOI. And some journals and online databases (e.g. PubMed) still don’t display the DOI prominently, but rather use their own numbering scheme.</li>
<li>Most reference managers allow sharing of reference in private or public groups. We have collaborative writing tools (Google Docs, Zoho Writer, Adobe Buzzword, and now even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://workspace.officelive.com/">Microsoft Office Live Workspace</a>) since at least 2006, but I think that no reference manager supports them beyond a simple copy and past function.</li>
<li>Almost all journal articles can be downloaded as PDF files, but users are still confused what they are allowed to do with these PDFs. Many publishers don’t even allow redistribution of these PDFs within an institution (e.g. for a journal club), something that is probably often ignored. These problems obviously don’t exist for Open Access publications, but it again gets complicated with those publishers that use a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Creative Commons Noncommercial license</a>. And to the best of my knowledge, no reference manager is providing copyright information for its references.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-applications-for-reference-management">Mobile Applications for Reference Management</h3>
<p>In the next part of my presentation I briefly talked about some of the mobile applications handling scientific journal articles (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.nature.com/mobileapps/">Nature</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2010/03/22/introducing-the-plos-medicine-iphone-application/">PLoS Medicine</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://blogs.nejm.org/now/index.php/introducing-the-nejm-this-week-iphone-app/2010/06/18/">NEJM</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://info.scopus.com/mobile">Scopus</a> for iPhone and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plos-reader/id370880976">PLoS Reader</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://mekentosj.com/papers/ipad/">Papers for iPad</a>) that have been released in the last few months. The small screen of mobile phones makes it difficult to read scientific papers (especially the tables and figures). The best use case is probably the scanning of journal table of contents or search alerts with bookmarking of interesting papers for later reading. In other words, a perfect job for a RSS reader synchronized with the desktop.</p>
<p>The iPad is a very different story, as for me it is a very good device for reading a scientific paper – better than a desktop computer and even better than a printout if you don’t have a color printer. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://mekentosj.com/papers/ipad/">Papers for iPad</a> is the perfect software for this use case, especially if you also own Papers for Mac and can simply transfer all your PDF files complete with reference information to the iPad.</p>
<h3 id="orcid">ORCID</h3>
<p>I then moved on to give a brief introduction to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> initiative (most of my slides were kindly provided my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/crossref-contributor-id">Geoff Bilder</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/hratner/introduction-to-orcid-stm-spring-2010">Howard Ratner</a>). Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID aims to provide a universal unique identifier for researchers. Past approaches have not gained universal acceptance because they were restricted to a particular discipline (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.repec.org/">RePEec</a>), country (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/amandahill/names-project-update">Names Project</a>) or were started by a single private company (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://info.scopus.com/scopus-in-detail/tools/authoridentifier/">Scopus Author Identifier</a>). ORCID is a broad initiative with already more than 100 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.orcid.org/gallery.php">participating organizations</a>. ORCID <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">was announced</a> in December 2009, and the initiative is currently working hard to first incorporate as a non-profit organization and then launch a first public prototype (based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.researcherid.com:80/Home.action">ResearcherID</a> software). Both milestones are planned for later this year.</p>
<p>Reference managers will of course benefit from a widely accepted author identifier, e.g. by making it much easier to find all publications from a particular author. ORCID can also be used to track other scientific contributions, e.g. peer review, blog posts, presentations or primary research datasets. Reference managers could also track (some of) these contributions by researchers.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended the annual meeting of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.asco.org/">American Society of Clinical Oncology</a> (ASCO) in Chicago.

<p>Blogging is a great way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/17/scienceonline2010-i-wish-i-was-there">report from conferences</a>, and for me <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> is the best microblogging tool to do that. Its use at the 2008 ISMB conference was nicely described in a <em><em>PLoS Comp Biol</em></em> paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263</a>) by Neil Saunders et al. Unfortunately it seems as if the use of FriendFeed is declining at every online science conference I go to, as everybody seems to be switching to <em><em>Twitter</em></em>. At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://bibcamp.wordpress.com/">BibCamp</a> that we organized in May we didn't even bother trying FriendFeed (or similar microbloging tools such as Google Buzz, ScienceFeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://hotpotato.com/">Hot Potato</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.snapgroups.com/">Snapgroups</a> or Google Wave).</p>
<p>My main problem with using Twitter at conferences is that it is difficult to connect all tweets talking about a particular session together. General hashtags like <em><em>#asco10</em></em> are not a solution for conferences with several thousand tweets. The ASCO conference organizers asked us to use two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.asco.org/ascov2/MyASCO/Twitter">special hash tags</a> for some sessions, but it seemed as if almost nobody was using them. I would not be surprised if someone invents (or has already done so) a nice service that connects tweets to conference sessions.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming of Twitter is the lack of automatic long-term archiving. Therefore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.twitter.com/RMEOncology">@RMEOncology</a> created a Twapper Keeper that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://twapperkeeper.com/hashtag/asco10">used to archive</a> the about 4500 tweets with the <em><em>#asco10</em></em> hashtag. You can do interesting things with such an archive, Cornelius Puschmann did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://wisspub.net/2010/05/11/bibcamp-auswertung/">analysis</a> of the Twitter activity at our recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/11/action-points">BibCamp</a> using the R statistical software.</p>
<p>On the second conference day we were invited by the ASCO organizers to a tweetup. We were twice as many people compared to the tweetup at last year's ASCO (including one familiar face, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.twitter.com/MaverickNY">@MaverickNY</a>). We had an interesting discussion for about an hour. The most important message for me: we were encouraged to freely tweet about the sessions, restricted only by common sense and not a particular policy. A large meeting like ASCO with a lot of press coverage and videotaping of most sessions obviously has it easier to allow widespread Twitter use than a smaller meeting like the Cold Spring Harbor Biology of Genomes meeting. The discussions at that meeting in May were nicely covered by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/05/what_a_difference_a_year_makes.php">Daniel MacArthur</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/can-you-tweet-from-cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-meetings/">Ivan Oransky</a>.</p>
<p>ASCO was also the first conference that I attended with an iPad. We had free WiFi (that worked in most places) and the iPad was great to write Tweets, look through the PDF of the sessions and posters I wanted to see (created back home), and to keep in touch via email and Skype. The only caveat: adding links to Tweets was difficult without multitasking – although this should become easier with the soon to be released iOS 4.</p>
<p>I did not like all Tweets about the conference. Twitter was obviously also used as a marketing tool. Although there is nothing wrong with that, some pharma companies felt it necessary to tweet exactly the same message again and again. I would have like more tweets reporting key findings from the sessions and/or adding comments or interesting links (e.g. with background information). But I'm optimistic that Twitter coverage at ASCO11 will be even better, and that by ASCO12 Twitter will be as mainstream and popular as email was at ASCO10.</p>
<p><em><em>Starting tomorrow, I will also write for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://lindau.nature.com/">Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting</a> blog (the meeting itself will start June 27).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Social media and privacy have a complicated relationship, as using social media implies giving up at least some privacy. And the value of a social networking site is directly related not only to the number of users, but also the extend of personal data that the site has collected. All this is of course not unique to social networking tools for scientists, but conducting science using online tools is different from connecting to friends or people with similar personal interests with these tools. One area where privacy issues are particularly prominent is the creation of unique identifiers for scientists, and here I'm involved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> initiative. We need a discussion about required privacy standards, and about the limitations of privacy that we accept in order to increase our scientific productivity.</p>

</figure>
<p>I've collected a couple of thoughts below. They are of course only starting points for a discussion, and I welcome any comments and suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-service-allows-anonymous-access">1. The service allows anonymous access</h3>
<p>Social networking sites for scientists can be quite useful for anonymous users, e.g. for reading of blog or forum posts. Users should not be required to sign up for a service just for reading a public message or looking at the public part of a user profile. Many social networking sites unfortunately require a user account these activities, and they often nag users to “complete their personal profiles”, i.e. to provide as much personal information as possible.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-service-has-a-privacy-policy">2. The service has a privacy policy</h3>
<p>I've randomly checked five social networking sites for scientists, and they all provide a privacy policy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.academia.edu/privacy">Academia.edu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.citeulike.org/privacy">CiteULike</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.mendeley.com/privacy/">Mendeley</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://network.nature.com/site/privacy">Nature Network</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.researchgate.net/application.PrivacyPolicy.html">ResearchGate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The privacy policy should make clear what user data the service is collecting, whether the service is providing these user data to third parties, and should provide an email address for further privacy questions.</p>
<h3 id="3-personal-data-are-owned-by-the-user">3. Personal data are owned by the user</h3>
<p>All personal data that a user uploads should be owned by the user, and the privacy policy should make this clear. This implies that a user should be allowed to cancel an account and delete all personal information (surprisingly difficult with most social networking sites), and that the user decides which part of the personal data is shared with others, and with whom.</p>
<p>To give users control over their privacy settings, these settings should default to not being public for everything beyond the most basic information, and they should not change over time (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/">The Evolution of privacy on Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>Obviously there is a large grey area. If I comment on a blog post by someone else, who owns this comment, and who should be allowed to delete this comment – me, the author of the blog post, and/or the provider of the social networking site? And who owns my usage data of a service, how often I logged in, my activity in the service, etc.?</p>
<h3 id="4-the-service-protects-the-user-data">4. The service protects the user data</h3>
<p>The social networking site should make all efforts necessary to protect the personal data of a user. There are examples where this has gone wrong, and this includes examples involving scientists (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031846/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090423/full/news.2009.398.html">Fake Facebook pages spin web of deceit</a>).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Next month I will participate in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://www.open.ac.uk/telstar/event/programmet">Innovations in Reference Management</a> event organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://twitter.com/ostephens">Owen Stevens</a> from the Open University. My own presentation has the title <em><em>Trends in Reference Management</em></em>, where I will try to focus on three emerging areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of mobile devices for reference management (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/08/nature-com-iphone-app-in-pictures">Nature.com iPhone App</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://mekentosj.com/papers/ipad/">Papers for iPad</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://info.scopus.com/mobile/">Scopus Alerts for iPhone</a>)</li>
<li>Social networks as discovery tools (using CiteULike, Twitter, FriendFeed, ResearchBlogging.org, etc. for finding relevant references instead of keyword searches in databases)</li>
<li>Integration of unique author identifiers (specifically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">ORCID</a>) into reference management tools. This will allow many interesting uses of reference lists (e.g. for automated researcher profiles or evaluation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference management has obviously come a long way from the desktop applications <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci00010a601">created 25 years ago</a>. In 2010 it is difficult to give a good description of the typical functions of reference managers. My 8 answers are below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman1.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>At their core all reference managers are databases that store references. They should allow the user to create or import all required reference types, find duplicate records, and connect references by the same author or published in the same journal. I don't think any reference manager completely supports even this small feature set (most of them don't do author disambiguation). And we rarely use reference managers in a much broader sense, e.g. for storing important blog posts or references to research datasets (as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://bit.ly/do6Ujj">suggested by Cameron Neylon</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman2.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Reference managers should put references into manuscripts, allowing a variety of citation styles. Only a few reference managers allow the user to edit citation styles, an important feature if an obscure style is required. Surprisingly, the functionality for reference management is usually not built into most word processors, but rather provided by the reference management software.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman3.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>All reference managers can import references directly from bibliographic databases, either by direct database connections, or via bookmarklets.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman4.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Some reference managers (most notably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a>) not only manage references, but also organize the full-text PDF files associated with them. There are many good reasons to keep the assets (such as scientific papers) and their metadata (the references) connected, e.g. to allow full-text searches in your reference manager. Scientific journals have started to embed reference metadata in full-text PDF files (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP Labelling for Nature</a>), making it easier to connect reference and PDF file.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman5.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Many reference managers now offer a web-based version. This allows using the same reference database with more than one computer and sharing of references with others. Some reference managers (e.g. CiteULike, RefWorks) only provide a web-based version.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman6.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>Many bibliographic databases (e.g. PubMed or Scopus) now allow user accounts with storing of search strategies, interesting references, etc. Does that make them reference managers?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman7.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>The flow of reference information has become much more complicated than simply from online database to reference manager to manuscript. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/03/bibapp-mashups-for-universities">Institutional bibliographies</a> are a good example.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman8.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>More and more we find interesting references not via keyword searches in databases, but rather through our social networks. This could be via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blog.citeulike.org/?p=136">CiteULike recommendations</a>, blog posts discussing a paper on ResearchBlogging.org, or one of your contacts talking about an interesting paper on Twitter, FriendFeed or Facebook. Current reference managers don't provide good functionality to handle this user behavior.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend was <em><em>BibCamp Hannover</em></em>, a “BarCamp for librarians and other hackers”. If you understand German, you can read about the sessions, discussions and people in the <a href="https://bibcamp.wordpress.com/">Blog</a>, <a href="http://bibcamp.pbworks.com/browse/#view=ViewFolder&amp;param=BibCamp%202010">Wiki</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033833/http://friendfeed.com/bibcamp">FriendFeed Room</a>. And Steffi Suhr wrote a nice post about <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/stuffysour/2010/05/09/the-most-beautiful-library-in-the-world">The most beautiful library in the world</a> in her <em><em>Nature Network</em></em> blog.</p>
<p>The BarCamp format worked very well for us – we used traditional pen and paper for session planning:</p>

Picture by <a href="http://edlf.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/bibcamp-2010-tag-1/">Martin Kramer</a> .</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I had suggested a session about <a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/bibapp-mashups-for-universities">Institutional Bibliographies</a>. We combined this with two related suggestions and had a very interesting session about the communication of scientists with librarians. One interesting theme in the discussion was the notion that the scientific workflow seems to be broken at some specific steps, for example:</p>
<h3 id="deposition-of-post-prints-in-institutional-repositories">Deposition of post-prints in institutional repositories</h3>
<p>Most journals allow authors to make the final version of an accepted manuscript (i.e. after peer review) <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeoinfo.html#prepostprints">publicly available</a> via an institutional repository. Most librarians would be happy to help their authors with this step, but unfortunately have no good tools to track the papers published at their institution, and never see the final version of accepted manuscript (many journals don't allow publisher-generated PDFs in repositories).</p>
<h3 id="re-submission-of-rejected-manuscripts">Re-submission of rejected manuscripts</h3>
<p>Rejected manuscripts are usually resubmitted to a different journal (most manuscripts will eventually be published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000254668.63378.32">somewhere</a>). Unfortunately the next journal will most likely use a different manuscript format, different citation styles and a different manuscript submission system. Some journals provide a <a href="https://www.nature.com/authors/author_services/transfer_manuscripts.html">manuscript transfer service</a>, but the comments made in the peer review are usually not available to the editors and reviewers of the next journal.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-scientists-to-publications">Connecting scientists to publications</h3>
<p>This is a topic that I have written about before (<a href="https://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">ORCID or how to build a unique identifier for scientists in 10 easy steps</a>). Until we have unique author identifiers, it is difficult or impossible to reliably find the papers published by a particular person (a good number of papers by <em><em>Fenner M</em></em> in <em><em>PubMed</em></em> are not written by me).</p>
<h3 id="distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Distributing papers for a journal club</h3>
<p>Another topic I have written about before (<a href="http://sensiblescience.io/mfenner/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club</a>). The problem is not only that email is really bad for sending PDF files to a group of people, but that most journals don't allow redistribution of their content, even within an institution with an institutional subscription.</p>
<h3 id="citation-counts">Citation counts</h3>
<p>The number of times a paper is cited is often used as a proxy to the importance of the science in that paper. Citation counts (e.g. in the form of Impact Factor or H-Index) are often used to evaluate researchers. There are many problems with this approach, because citation counts are influenced by many other factors (e.g. time, popularity of the subject area, self-citations). But the biggest problem is the fact that there is no general agreement on how to count citations, and no database that makes this information freely available.</p>
<p>It might make sense to make a list of these broken steps, and then estimate the effort that would be required to fix each of them. Some broken steps are more important, and some fixes easier than others, so this exercise would give a good list of action points.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Friday afternoon discussions can be dangerous. Last Friday I talked with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://network.nature.com/people/UC0402CE6/profile">Heinz Pampel</a> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=137">Helmholtz Open Access Initiative</a> via email about the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://bibcamp.wordpress.com/">BibCamp Hannover</a> (a barcamp for librarians and others interested in online science that will take place this weekend). I said that I was looking for a solution to make the list of publications from our institution more accessible – we currently store them in a regularly updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.refworks.com/refshare/?site=047931198224000000%2F">RefWorks database</a>. Heinz not only told me that there is actually a name for this kind of tool (Current Research Information System or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.cris2010.org/">CIRS</a>), but also gave me some good links. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:152805/Simon_Porter.pdf">This talk</a> by Simon Porter from the University of Melbourne is for example a very good introduction to the topic.</p>
<p>Heinz also suggested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://bibapp.org/">BibApp</a>, a nice web-based tool for exactly this purpose written in the <em><em>Ruby on Rails</em></em> programming language. Because I am a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/en/">very familiar with Ruby on Rails</a>, I took a closer look.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://vimeo.com/2104723">Bibapp – Find Campus Experts</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://vimeo.com/user885968">Eric Larson</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>In the end I spent a good deal of this weekend setting up <em><em>BibApp</em></em>, importing all publications from our institution since 2008 via <em><em>Refworks</em></em>, starting to add researchers and research groups and adjusting <em><em>BibApp</em></em> to our needs (mainly changing the layout to our institution style and starting to translate the templates into German). <em><em>BibApp</em></em> is already a fully working system and is telling me some interesting things. This includes many interesting papers from our institution that I didn't know about, but also that two researchers each have published more than 150 papers in two years, and that my colleagues have published 6 papers in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411168">Medical Hypotheses</a> since 2008. The technical aspects of setting up <em><em>BibApp</em></em> are almost solved (it helps that I run two other <em><em>Ruby on Rails</em></em> applications at my institution), so now I have to convince our library and administration that it's worth having (and maintaining) such a CRIS tool.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/04/17/improving-the-conduct-of-science">Two weeks ago I wrote about the upper part of the figure</a> (for a <em><em>NSF</em></em> workshop that got postponed to September because of the Volcano ash). As far as I can see, there is no standard between funding agencies for grant reporting, and both DataCite and ORCID are fairly new initiatives.</p>
<p>The CRIS can be used to facilitate access to institutional repositories or primary research datasets. <em><em>BibApp</em></em> supports the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue54/allinson-et-al/">SWORD</a> protocol for article deposition, and it automatically checks all papers against the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">ROMEO</a> database of publisher copyright policies. A CRIS is a great discovery tool and it can be further enhanced by integration with social networking tools (e.g. with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/04/28/coming-soon-all-new-nature-network">new Nature Network</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/press-release/announcing-mendeley-open-api/">Mendeley API</a> both announced a few days ago).</p>
<p>The main interest of administrations if of course evaluation of research output. A CRIS can be used to do exactly that, and it has two advantages: a) it can automate some of the processes that are currently done manually by researchers (regularly collecting and reporting information about grants and publications), and b) it is a great platform to develop new tools for the evaluation of scientific output. My institution currently evaluates using the <em><em>Impact Factor</em></em> of the published papers, and takes first and last authorship (and female authors) into consideration. A CRIS would allow an institution to use similar tools as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action">PLoS Article-Level Metrics</a> (usage data, citation data, usage by social networking tools) instead of the <em><em>Impact Factor</em></em>, and several projects are already trying some of that, e.g. the German <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english/">Open Access Statistics</a> project.</p>
<p>But the best thing about CRIS tools in general, and <em><em>BibApp</em></em> in particular, is that they add a lot of value for relatively little effort. Universities don't want to (and can't) compete with large institutions or companies such as scientific publishers. Because they basically just integrate the data that are already available in an intelligent way (Mashup in Web 2.0 language), they require a reasonable effort to maintain. This will be particularly true once the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> system of unique author identifiers is in place, because author disambiguation is currently one of the most time-consuming aspects (even though <em><em>BibApp</em></em> is pretty smart about this). I'm looking forward to adapt <em><em>BibApp</em></em> to the <em><em>ORCID</em></em> prototype system that is planned for this summer.</p>

<p>I asked <em><em>Renny Guida</em></em> from Thomson Reuters a few questions about his thoughts on unique author identifiers in general, and <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> and <em><em>ORCID</em></em> in particular.</p>

<p><em><em>Members of the ResearcherID team (from left to right): Renny Guida, Ellen Rotenberg, Chiu Chung and Deepak Chaturvedi.</em></em></p>
<h3 id="1-what-is-researcherid">1. What is ResearcherID?</h3>
<p><em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is a freely available system that helps the research community overcome the issues of individual name ambiguity and attribution. The system is available to everyone and allows a researcher to establish, maintain and control a biographic and bibliographic profile.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015im_/http://images.isiknowledge.com/WOK48B3/images/RID/rid_logo.gif" class="kg-image" />

<p>The system is the result of research that found that individual identity touches many parts of scholarly communications and that researcher’s and academic institutions were ready to take some ownership of the issue to ensure proper attribution of scholarship.</p>
<p>The Registry is composed of biographical and bibliographic components which are accessible at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/">researcherid.com</a> web site. A web services API makes it possible for an institution or organization to create and use this information in their systems.</p>
<p>The biographical component of the registry creates a unique identifier and persistent web location for each user. The system is designed to allow a researcher to control privacy and access to the information in their profile, even if the information was uploaded by the researcher’s institution. Researchers can enter and manage information about themselves, their work and their affiliations (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/rid/C-3246-2009">example record</a>).</p>
<p>The bibliographic component of <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> allows researchers to connect articles, patents and other scholarly items to their profile. Items can be loaded from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.isiwebofknowledge.com/">Web of Science</a> or in a text format into one of three lists.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, a web service makes it possible for organizations to create and manage both biographic and bibliographic information for their faculty and researchers. Upload, download and search services make this possible. For example, David Palmer at the University of Hong Kong uses ResearcherID to create <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://hub.hku.hk/rp/rp00023">identifiers for HKU researchers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-is-orcid-and-how-does-it-relate-to-researcherid"><em><em>2. What is ORCID, and how does it relate to ResearcherID?</em></em></h3>
<p>Open Researcher Contributor ID (ORCID) is an initiative to better understand how the issue of individual name ambiguity can be solved. Currently a cross section of the research community is discussing ways to overcome the issue with the hopes of establishing an open registry that will be used by the global research community.</p>
<p>One of the lessons learned from Thomson Reuters’ development of <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is that issues of name ambiguity and attribution are problems bigger than any one organization can address. And, having multiple solutions to the problem will not meet the needs of researchers or the scholarly community. Based on <em><em>ResearcherID’s</em></em> innovation and success in addressing these issues, Thomson Reuters plans to offer <em><em>ORCID</em></em> the technology and infrastructure for managing the biographic registry.</p>
<p>The initiative has grown from early 2009 conversations between <em><em>Thomson Reuters</em></em> and <em><em>Nature Publishing Group</em></em> into a global collaboration of academic institutions, research centers, funding agencies, scholarly societies and publishers. To date, everyone involved in the effort is volunteering their time and work is focused on the business and technical implications of creating an independent organization to manage an identity registry system. More information on the initiative can be found at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> web site.</p>
<h3 id="3-there-are-numerous-other-initiatives-for-unique-researcher-identifiers-what-is-unique-about-researcherid">3.There are numerous other initiatives for unique researcher identifiers. What is unique about ResearcherID?</h3>
<p>What is unique about <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is that it is a global initiative and not focused on any one organization, consortia, country or application. The system also ensures privacy and allows researchers to control their information. The <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> is portable and can be included in authored works and used as a dynamic link on the researcher’s website.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-does-researcherid-integrate-with-other-thomson-reuters-products-and-outside-tools">4. How does ResearcherID integrate with other Thomson Reuters products and outside tools?</h3>
<p>The system was designed to allow all users, independent of any Thomson Reuters subscriptions, to benefit from the application. All users have the ability to establish an identifier, create and manage a biographical profile, and manage a list of scholarly works.</p>
<p>The <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> system is closely coupled with EndNote and by May 2010, all ResearcherID users, independent of any Thomson Reuters subscriptions, will have access to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.endnoteweb.com/">web version of EndNote</a>.</p>
<p>For users having access to the <em><em>Web of Knowledge</em></em> there are a number of additional integration points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers can claim items from the <em><em>Web of Science</em></em> by either performing a search or using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://images.isiknowledge.com/WOK46/help/WOS/h_da_sets.html">Distinct Author Sets</a> feature that automatically clusters articles believed to be authored by the same person.</li>
<li>Researchers can claim items from any <em><em>Web of Knowledge</em></em> database.</li>
<li>The ResearcherID system uses the <em><em>Web of Science</em></em> to automatically update the ResearcherID system with the times cited count.</li>
<li><em><em>Web of Science</em></em> times cited information is used to generate personal citation reports and the citation visualizations (currently being tested in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://wokinfo.com/researcherid/ridlabs/">ResearcherID labs</a> environment) to visualize collaboration and citation networks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-do-you-plan-to-continue-with-researcherid-once-orcid-is-fully-working">5. Do you plan to continue with ResearcherID once ORCID is fully working?</h3>
<p>Our plans are to adapt and enhance <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> to support <em><em>ORCID</em></em> and allow users access to personal citation functionality and services on our <em><em>Web of Knowledge</em></em> platform. Thomson Reuters is one of the catalysts of the <em><em>ORCID</em></em> initiative and is working with our colleagues to help <em><em>ORCID</em></em> succeed. We will fully support <em><em>ORCID</em></em> from the enhanced <em><em>ResearcherID</em></em> platform and other Thomson Reuters applications.</p>
<h3 id="6-what-would-be-the-benefits-of-using-a-unique-author-identifier-for-a-researcher">6. What would be the benefits of using a unique author identifier for a researcher?</h3>
<p>The unique author identifier not only addresses the issues of name ambiguity and attribution but benefits the scholarly communication process by maintaining the link between the researchers and their scholarship. This link is critical given the proliferation of information available on the Web and the demand to find information in less time and with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>The real benefit comes when all involved in the scholarly communications can leveraged the identifier to improve the process. Easier tenure review, better assessment of research output, more intelligent discovery tools, enhanced peer review systems and tools to maintain scholarly networks are some of the benefits of using a unique author identifier.</p>
<h3 id="7-where-do-you-see-the-biggest-obstacles-in-launching-a-universally-accepted-unique-identifier-for-researchers-technical-or-social">7. Where do you see the biggest obstacles in launching a universally accepted unique identifier for researchers? Technical or social?</h3>
<p>I see two large obstacles. The first, and I believe most important, is the researchers perception of security and ownership. The system must allow researchers to control and manage their data.</p>
<p>The second biggest obstacle is the sustainability of an organization that would provide the identity service. <em><em>ORCID</em></em> is proving that the community can work together to address the technicalities of a global identity system. And, while there are significant technical, privacy and other challenges, the initiative is making great progress. However, such a service requires resources and the system must be supported financially by the community.</p>
<h3 id="8-what-is-your-thinking-with-regards-to-automatically-assigning-unique-author-identifiers-to-papers-vs-authors-claiming-their-publications">8. What is your thinking with regards to automatically assigning unique author identifiers to papers vs. authors claiming their publications?</h3>
<p>I see these as being two complementary and important services. Algorithmic clustering of papers is a common feature in many applications including the <em><em>Web of Science</em></em> and other bibliographic databases. For the most part, these clustering systems do a good job identifying a high percentage of papers for a particular author. However, because none of the industry’s algorithms are perfect, a claiming system that enables the researcher to associate all of their papers is an ideal complement and helps to complete a career profile of a researcher’s works.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Assuming our airports are again open next weekend, I will be attending a meeting organized by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a> (National Science Foundation) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.eurohorcs.org/E/Pages/home.aspx">EuroHORCS</a> (European Heads of Research Councils) on <em><em>Changing the Conduct of Science in the Information Age</em></em> in Washington on April 26. We have been asked to submit a one page white paper in advance of the meeting.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/04/17/improving_the_conduct_of_science/#fn1">1</a></sup> I decided to focus on the importance of standards, obviously leaving out many other important technological and social aspects. But defining and adhering to standards will enable or enhance a number of very interesting ways to conduct and report science in the information age.</p>

</figure>
<p>Improving the conduct of science through digital technology requires standards for linking to and formatting scholarly resources. These standards should be coordinated by independent organizations that are not restricted to geographic areas or particular research domains.</p>
<h3 id="data-access">Data access</h3>
<p>Digital Object Identifiers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.doi.org/">DOIs</a>) are the primary system to link to digital content. The International <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> initiative is the DOI registration agency for scientific primary data. Although there are many uses of DOIs for primary research data (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.pangaea.de/">PANGAEA</a>, earth system research), many systems still use different identifiers.<br />
Research funders and journals working in specific domains should collaborate on standards and best practices for primary research datasets, and journal publishers should encourage or even require linking to research datasets from publications. Successful examples include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a> (genetic sequences) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html">MIAME</a> (microarray gene expression).</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-access">Knowledge access</h3>
<p>DOIs have become the standard identifier for electronic scholarly publications and are managed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> registration agency. Journal articles, databases and websites linking to scholarly publications should use DOIs whenever possible instead of internal identifiers such as the PubMed ID or direct links to publisher webpages. Publishers should implement citation styles that use the DOI instead of volume, issue and page numbers.<br />
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM DTD</a> is the standard format used by PubMed Central and many scholarly publishers to produce content for reading in the HTML, PDF or ePub formats. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx">Article Authoring Add-in for Microsoft Office Word</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8">Lemon8-XML</a> allow researchers to produce content in the NLM DTD format. The workflow of writing, reviewing and publishing scientific papers should be based completely on the NLM DTD and tools for collaborative writing, journal submission and peer review should be build around that format.</p>
<h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3>
<p>The recently announced<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/04/17/improving_the_conduct_of_science/#fn2">2</a> Open Researcher and Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) is one of many initiatives for a unique researcher identifier, but has probably the broadest support among institutions, publishers and research organizations. ORCID will be managed by an independent non-profit organization, and will allow the exchange of profiles with other researcher identifier systems such as those used by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://repec.org/">RePEc</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Inspire/WebHome">Inspire</a>.<br />
The information in the author profile may be initially provided by an institution, society or publisher, but should eventually be claimed by the individual researcher because of privacy concerns and because automated author disambiguation is never 100% accurate. Attribution should include all aspects of scholarly activity, including curation of primary research datasets and peer review.<br />
The Public Library of Science (PLoS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">article-level metrics</a> make available comprehensive information (citations, downloads, social bookmarks, comments, etc.) with every published article. This system should be linked to author identifiers and developed into a standard for scholarly resources. Other scholarly publishers and databases for primary research data should then adopt these metrics.</p>

<p>Peer review is central to how we evaluate science and therefore how journal papers, grants and jobs are awarded. Peer review is done in many different ways, and has dramatically changed in the last 25 years. But the purpose of peer review is still to improve the quality of research by providing feedback, and to evaluate the quality of research. The evaluation serves as a filter both for limited resources (e.g. grants or jobs; publication in a journal is no longer a limited resource), and for other researchers to focus on the most relevant work in their field.</p>
<p>It is therefore surprising that relatively little research on peer review itself has been done. Most discussions focus on the shortcomings of peer review, and the arguments are often based on personal experience and/or interests. Good research on peer review can help to improve the peer review process. Last week such a paper was published in <em><em>PLoS ONE.</em></em></p>

<p><strong><strong>Richard Kravitz</strong></strong> and colleagues looked at the recommendations of peer reviewers, and how they influenced the editorial decision to publish or reject a paper. The study looked at 6213 manuscripts received 2004-2008 at the <em><em>Journal of General Internal Medicine (JGIM)</em></em> where four of the authors were either current or former editors in chief.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/pone.0010072.g001.png" class="kg-image" width="2292" height="3101" alt="Figure 1.

Flow chart showing outcome of reviews pertaining to 2264 manuscripts undergoing external peer review at the <em><em>Journal of General Internal Medicine</em></em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At <em><em>JGIM</em></em> submitted manuscripts were first screened by an editor in chief and a deputy editor. Most manuscripts were rejected at this step, 2264 manuscripts (36%) were sent out for peer review. 2916 reviewers wrote a total of 5581 reviews (1-4 per manuscript) which included comments and a recommendation. Eventually 43% of the manuscripts were accepted for publication.</p>
<p>Overall, there was agreement between all reviewers in just over half of the manuscripts (54.6% ), furthermore editors did not follow these recommendations in another 10% of manuscripts:</p>

Likelihood of Initial Decision to Reject in Relation to Reviewer Agreement." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true"><strong>Table 1.</strong> Likelihood of Initial Decision to Reject in Relation to Reviewer Agreement.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The inter-reviewer agreement was slightly higher than what would have been expected by chance, and was lower than the agreement between recommendations for several manuscripts by the same reviewer. In contrast, there was little correlation between editorial decisions for different manuscripts handled by the same editor.</p>
<p>The authors write in the discussion:</p>
<p><em><em>If reviewers cannot regularly agree on whether to recommend rejection or further consideration, the marginal contribution of such summative recommendations may be small, and worse, they may distract from reviewers' primary contribution, which is to improve the reporting – and ultimately the performance – of science.</em></em></p>
<p>The paper authors consider the following to improve reviewer recommendations: using more reviewers per manuscript, providing better training for reviewers, or recommendations could be dropped altogether and reviewers asked to focus instead on evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of manuscripts. Some journals are obviously using this latter approach.</p>
<p>Several studies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094155/http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000254668.63378.32">have shown</a> that most rejected manuscripts will eventually be published somewhere else. One important reason is that publication space in journals is no longer a scarcity as it was before electronic publishing became widespread. This means that the ultimate decision whether or not something will be published in a peer-reviewed journal rests with the authors and not the editors or reviewers. Reviewers should keep this in mind.</p>

For each of the four sessions (patient perspective, health care professional perspective, pharma perspective and <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> mission and goals) we first split up in 3-4 smaller groups to talk about some of the questions, and in the second half summarized and discussed this as the whole group. Some participants demonstrated excellent skills with the whiteboard.</p>
<p><em><em>How do we get scientists interested in social media?</em></em> is something we have talked about many times, e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/10/19/scientists-still-not-joining-social-networks/">Scientists Still Not Joining Social Networks</a>. Healthcare professionals are also reluctant to use social media, and we come up with some interesting suggestions to do something about this:</p>

<p>We also talked about the dangers of getting involved with social media. The doctor-patient communication is something that is difficult to translate from personal communication to social media (lawyers and some other professions have similar problems), but otherwise the dangers look familiar to many scientists:</p>

<p>The last part of the meeting was about <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em>, and what next steps to take. <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> is very focused on moving the agenda forward, and that spirit penetrated the whole meeting. After a very productive discussion we come up with some good action items:</p>

</figure>
<p><em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> is very much built around Twitter, including regular Tweetups every Friday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23hcsmeucamp">heavy use</a> during the meeting. I am a big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.twitter.com/mfenner">Twitter fan</a>, but have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/17/scienceonline2010-i-wish-i-was-there">argued before</a> that Twitter is not the best tool for conference microblogging, as it is difficult to have connected discussions around a topic, and archieving is complicated. And pictures, documents and links are better collected in places like <em><em>Flickr</em></em>, <em><em>Slideshare</em></em> and <em><em>delicious</em></em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://mfenner.posterous.com/best-practices-for-hcsmeu-social-media-use">My suggestions</a> for the <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> knowledge hub therefore include more use of other social media tools, plus <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> or a similar aggregation/microblogging tool to connect all the social media in one place. <em><em>Facebook</em></em> is actually a perfect tool to do all this, but unfortunately is still perceived by many as a tool for <em><em>private</em></em> social networking. I met many very smart and friendly people during the meeting and hope to hear more about <em><em>#hcsmeu</em></em> at <em><em>Science Online London 2010</em></em> in September or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.medicine20congress.com/ocs/index.php/med/med2010">Medicine 2.0 conference</a> in November.</p>

<p>In the March 25 edition of <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://client.norc.org/jole/SOLEweb/JLHome.html">Julia Lane</a>, Program Director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501084&amp;org=NSF&amp;from_org=NSF">Science of Science and Innovation Policy Program</a> at the National Science Foundation, wrote an interesting opinion piece about the assessment of scientific performance. She argues that the current systems of measurement are inadequate, as they have several inherent problems and do not capture the full spectrum of scientific activities. Good scientific metrics are difficult, but without them we risk making the wrong decisions about funding and academic positions.</p>
<p>Julia Lane suggests that we develop and use standard identifiers both for researchers and their scientific output (examples given include the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> for publications and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> as unique author identifier), that we develop standards for reporting scientific achievements (e.g. using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/rppr/">Research Performance Progress Report</a> format), and that we open up and connect the various tools and databases that collect scientific output. She cites the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://lattes.cnpq.br/english/index.htm">Lattes</a> database for Brasilian researchers as a successful example for systematically collecting scientific output. Another example given is the ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://nrc59.nas.edu/star_info2.cfm">STAR METRICS</a> project which measures the impact of federally funded research on economic, scientific and social outcomes.</p>
<p>The article emphasizes that is not enough to think about how to best collect and report scientific output, but that it is equally important to understand what these data mean and how to use them, and this may differ from field to field. Knowledge creation is complex and measuring this can not be reduced to counting scientific papers and the number of times they are cited. Social scientists and economists should be involved in this step. Julia Lane suggests an international platform supported by funding agencies in which ideas and potential solutions for science metrics can be discussed.</p>

</figure>
<p>The article contains a lot of food for thought and has already collected some insightful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/full/464488a.html#comments">comments</a>. In perfect timing, <em><em>Nature</em></em> this week not only made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/naturenews.html">Nature News available without a subscription</a>, but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/464466a">added commenting to all their articles</a>. I would like to add some thoughts on topics that were not covered because of space constraints and different perspective.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-standard-identifiers-for-research-output"><strong><strong>What are the standard identifiers for research output?</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Using standard identifiers for research output is an essential first step, and the standard identifier for scientific papers is the DOI. So why is it that PubMed (the most important database for biomedical articles, published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health) still uses their own PMID and doesn't display the DOI in their abstract and summary views? And where is the DOI in abstracts, full-text HTML or PDF of articles published in the New England Journal of Medicine, to take just one popular medical journal as an example? Both PubMed and the NEJM obviously use the DOI, but why do they make it so difficult for others?</p>
<p>The unique author identifier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> was mentioned in the article (disclaimer: I am a member of the ORCID technical working group). There are many other initiatives for uniquely identifying researchers, most of them older than <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> which was started in November 2009. But is very important that we can agree on a single author identifier that is supported by researchers, institutions, journals and funding organizations. <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> already has support from a growing list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.orcid.org/gallery.php">ORCID members</a> and is our best chance for a widely supported and open unique author identifier. But this list of <strong><strong>ORCID</strong></strong> members is very short on funding organizations (with notable exceptions such as the <strong><strong>Wellcome Trust</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>EMBO</strong></strong>). What is holding them back, and that includes the <strong><strong>National Science Foundation</strong></strong> (where Julia Lane works) and the U.S. <strong><strong>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</strong></strong>?</p>
<p>Persistent identifiers are essential to attribute, cite and share primary research data sets. We have a long tradition for this with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/">sequence data</a>, and there is growing demand in other research areas, especially when huge amounts of data are collected (one example is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.pangaea.de/about/">PANGEA</a> for earth system research). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> is a new initiative that aims to improve the scholarly infrastructure around datasets, and to <em><em>increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scientific record</em></em>.</p>
<p>With the focus on research papers, we forget that we do not have standard identifiers for many aspects of scientific activity, including</p>
<ul>
<li>research grants</li>
<li>principal investigator in clinical trials</li>
<li>scientific prizes and awards</li>
<li>invited lectures</li>
<li>curation of scientific databases</li>
<li>mentoring of students</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-we-measure-scientific-output">How do we measure scientific output?</h3>
<p>Citations are the traditional way to measure the impact of a scientific paper. Some of the problems with this approach are well-known and were for example highlighted in a 2007 editorial in the <em><em>Journal of Cell Biology</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200711140">Show me the data</a>). We need a metric that is open and not proprietary, and that measures the citations of an individual paper and not the journal as a whole. We should also not forget that the number of citations can't be compared between different fields.</p>
<p>A 2009 analysis by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.mesur.org/">MESUR</a> project indicates that scientific impact of a paper can not be measured by any single indicator (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022">A Principal Component Analysis of 39 Scientific Impact Measures</a>). Alternatives to citations are usage statistics such as HTML page views and PDF downloads, popularity in social bookmarking sites, coverage in blog posts, and comments to articles. The <em><em>PLoS</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">article level metrics</a> introduced in September 2009 combine these different metrics, and make the data openly available.</p>
<p>How best to measure the other aspects of scientific output is largely unknown. It is possible to count the number of research grants or the total amount of money awarded, but should we simply count the number of submitted research datasets, invited lectures, science blog posts, etc., or do we need some quality indicator similar to citations?</p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-need-all-this"><strong><strong>Why do we need all this?</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Julia Lane emphasizes that we need science metrics to make the right decisions about funding and academic positions. And I fully agree with her that we need more research by social scientists and economists to better understand what these data mean and how best to use them. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that suggests that science metrics alone may be poor indicators of future scientific achievements, simply because there are too many confounding factors. Maybe we also need to find a better term, as metric implies that scientific output can be reduced to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://friendfeed.com/jcbradley/18e76233/binfield-article-level-metrics-should-be">one or more numbers</a>.</p>
<p>Another important motivation for improving science metrics, and not mentioned in the article, is to reduce the burden on researchers and administrators in evaluating research. The proportion of time spent doing research vs. time spent applying for funding, submitting manuscripts, filling out evaluation forms, doing peer review, etc. has become ridiculous for many active scientists. Initiatives such as the standardized <strong><strong>Research Performance Progress Report</strong></strong> format mentioned in the paper or automated tools to created a publication list or CV can reduce this burden. Funding organizations are also trying to reduce the burden of evaluating research , e.g. by increasing the time of funding from 3 to 5 years, reducing the number of papers that can be listed in grant applications (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/03/01/german-research-foundation-says-that-numbers-arent-everything">German Research Foundation says that numbers aren't everything</a>), or funding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/investigator-awards/Implementation/index.htm">investigators and not projects</a>.</p>
<p>Science metrics are not only important for evaluating scientific output, they are also great discovery tools, and this may indeed be their more important use. Traditional ways of discovering science (e.g. keyword searches in bibliographic databases) are increasingly superseded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101936/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/22/there-is-still-so-much-to-learn-in-reference-management">non-traditional approaches</a> that use social networking tools for awareness, evaluations and popularity measurements of research findings.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday the <em><em>Archives of Internal Medicine</em></em> released a study that analyzed the news reporting about cancer in 8 large-readership newspapers and 5 national magazines in the United States. The authors identified 2228 cancer-focused articles published between 2005-2007 and did a more detailed analysis on a random sample of 436 (20%) articles.</p>
<p>20% of articles discussed cancer in general, 35% focused on breast cancer, and 15% focused on prostate cancer. 32% of the articles focused on survival and 8% focused on death and dying. 57% articles discussed aggressive treatments, but only two articles exclusively discussed end-of-life palliative care. Only 13% of articles reported that aggressive treatment might fail to cure or extend life, and only 30% of articles mentioned that cancer treatments can result in (sometimes serious) adverse events.</p>

<p>Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States and therefore cancer news coverage is relevant to many people. One important finding of the study is the relative under-reporting of death and dying and palliative care, despite the well-documented benefits for patients and their families. The <strong><strong>Pallimed</strong></strong> blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654/http://www.pallimed.org/2010/03/cancer-reporting-in-media-guess-what.html">discusses this</a> in more detail. The article was also discussed at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654/http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_articles/media_exaggerates_progress_cancer_research">Scientific Blogging</a> and at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654/http://blog.syracuse.com/cny/2010/03/media_paint_overly_optimistic_view_of_cancer_medical_study_says.html">syracuse.com</a>.</p>
<p>I am not surprised by these findings, as they seem to reflect the expectations of most cancer patients and their families towards treatment. In my personal experience as a doctor treating cancer patients, most patients, relatives and their treating physicians (including myself) are overly optimistic about the potential benefits of an aggressive cancer treatment (especially if part of a clinical trial), and talk much less about the possibility of the treatment not working, side effects, or death and dying. The scientific literature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100654/http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2008.17.2221">supports this personal experience</a>.</p>
<p>The study raises a number of additional questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What scientific information was used as background information for the news reports? Conference reports vs. published papers, case reports vs. large randomized trials, research in animal models vs. clinical research? Was a source for the research provided in the news reports?</li>
<li>What is the cancer news coverage by science/medical bloggers? Is there a similar bias towards aggressive treatment approaches and an under-reporting of treatment failures and adverse events?</li>
<li>Are there geographical differences (U.S. vs. Europe, urban vs. rural areas) in cancer news reporting and changes over time?</li>
<li>How are other areas of science covered in the media, e.g. other common diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease or malaria, climate research or other reasearch areas with large public interest, or basic science research?</li>
</ul>

<p>The blog post is required reading for everybody interested in science and Web 2.0 and has attracted a lot of thoughtful comments (on the blog and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://friendfeed.com/the-life-scientists/9bdff1e4/science-and-web-2-0-talking-about-vs-doing">on FriendFeed</a>). In another discussion <em><em>Thomas S</em>ö<em>derquist</em></em> from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.corporeality.net/museion/">Medical Museion in Copenhagen</a> reminded me that there are limitations of what can be done online. My blog focusses on talking about science rather than doing science, but this post is about doing science online. My research focusses on clinical cancer research, and in this field the advantages and limitations of doing science online are obviously different from other subject areas (bioinformatics for example obviously looks very different). It probably makes sense to ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are your research data collected in (or easily converted into) digital form?</li>
<li>Are standard data formats and standard tools (preferably as open source software) available?</li>
<li>Do you regularly collaborate with scientists in other locations?</li>
<li>Is information about ongoing research projects publicly available?</li>
<li>Do journals have policies regarding the publication of your primary research data?</li>
<li>Are there objections to make the research data freely available?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="are-your-research-data-collected-in-or-easily-converted-into-digital-form">Are your research data collected in (or easily converted into) digital form</h3>
<p>Electronic medical records (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record">EMR</a>) have the potential to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01unbox.html">improve patient care and reduce costs</a>. But for now, often only some clinical information (particularly lab and radiology results) is available electronically and paper-based patient records are still commonly used. And both electronic and paper-based records have to be adapted to be useful for clinical research, e.g. by allowing a detailed documentation of adverse events.</p>
<p>The raw clinical data of a patient in a trial (called <em><em>source data</em></em> in clinical research) are entered into a case-report form (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report_form">CRF</a>). The purpose of this two-step process is to make sure that all required data are collected and that they are entered correctly. Many clinical trials now use electronic CRFs or electronic data capture (EDC). But these tools are still surprisingly difficult to use and more expensive than paper-based solutions, so that many trials stick to paper CRFs and enter the data into a computer at a later stage. It also doesn't help that the EDC market is very fragmented, so that institutions have to learn to use several different tools.</p>
<h3 id="are-standard-data-formats-and-standard-tools-preferably-as-open-source-software-available">Are standard data formats and standard tools (preferably as open source software) available?</h3>
<p>Clinical Data Interchange Standard (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.cdisc.org/">CDISC</a>) is the standard format for clinical research data. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.openclinica.org/">OpenClinica</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/CTMS/?pid=primary.2006-10-24.9768040952&amp;sid=ctmsws&amp;status=True">Clinical Trials Management System of CaBIG</a> are two examples of Open Source tools for clinical research.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-regularly-collaborate-with-scientists-in-other-locations">Do you regularly collaborate with scientists in other locations?</h3>
<p>Most clinical trials are multi-center trials that are conducted in different locations, often even in different countries or continents. The coordination of the different trial locations uses email and web conferencing, but often relies more on human resources than on modern Web 2.0 tools.</p>
<h3 id="is-information-about-ongoing-research-projects-publicly-available">Is information about ongoing research projects publicly available?</h3>
<p>Clinical research is one of only a few research areas where information about (almost) all ongoing research project is publicly available. Clinical trial registries serve two purposes. They make it much easier for patients and their treating physicians to find relevant clinical trials. And they allow clinical researchers to understand what clinical research is going on in their field, and to avoid publication bias. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> at the US National Institutes of Health is the largest clinical trial registry. For reasons that are difficult to understand, the European Clinical Trials database (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/https://eudract.emea.europa.eu/">EudraCT</a>) is not available to the public, but work is in progress to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.ecpc-online.org/component/docman/doc_download/68-ecpc-comments-on-qconsultation-for-data-fields-from-eudract-made-available-on-eudrapharmq.html?ItemId=127">change</a> that.</p>
<h3 id="do-journals-have-policies-regarding-the-publication-of-your-primary-research-data">Do journals have policies regarding the publication of your primary research data?</h3>
<p>An article in the <em><em>BMJ</em></em> last month by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz and colleagues<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances_and_problems_of_doing_science_online/#fn1">1</a></sup> tries to provide guidance on how to provide raw clinical data for publication. The main focus of the paper is patient privacy. Publication of raw clinical data either as dataset or as part of a research paper is still very uncommon. The meta-analysis of individual patient data<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances_and_problems_of_doing_science_online/#fn2">2</a></sup> requires the raw clinical data of several clinical trials, and because of the required effort is probably underused.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-objections-to-make-the-research-data-freely-available">Are there objections to make the research data freely available?</h3>
<p>Patient privacy is a major concern when publishing raw clinical data, and it's therefore critical to remove all identifying information from the dataset. This not only includes <em><em>direct identifiers</em></em> such as patient names, birthdates, unique identifying numbers or facial photographs, but also <em><em>indirect identifers</em></em> such as place of treatment, rare disease or treatment, occupation or place of work, etc. It is the consensus of the authors of the <em><em>BMJ</em></em> paper that datasets with three or more indirect identifiers should be evaluated for the risk that individuals might be identifiable before they are made available,</p>
<p>In contrast to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/">Open Notebook Science</a>, it is impossible to make the results of a clinical trial publicly available before the trial is completed. The statistical design of the clinical trial is based on the number of patients needed to show a significant difference – looking at interim data could influence patient recruitment. Double-blind designs (where neither patient nor treating physician now which treatment arm the patient is in) are based on the same principle.</p>
<p>In clinical research there is often more at stake than the well-being of patients and the careers of the scientists involved. <em><em>Pfizer</em></em> and <em><em>Roche</em></em> last week each lost $1 billion in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abbott-pfizer-lead-drug-stocks-lower-2010-03-12">stock market value</a> after they both announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.pharmastrategyblog.com/2010/03/more-phase-iii-cancer-trials-flop-pfizer-sutent-and-roche-avastin.html">negative results of large phase III cancer trials</a>. Drug companies therefore have a great interest in whether and when research findings are published, and that includes the raw clinical data. The selective publication of positive research findings is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/11/18/publication-bias-in-clinical-trials">publication bias</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">mandatory reporting of clinical trial results in ClinicalTrials.gov</a> was introduced by the FDA to reduce publication bias.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Online tools can help with doing clinical research and there is probably a lot of untapped potential. From the perspective of an individual researcher or a small research group, it probably makes the most sense to develop and/or use tools that solve specific problems. I use the online project management tool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> to coordinate one clinical research project. And I have created a web-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/">clinical trials registry</a> for our university hospital. The internet version of this registry helps patients and referring physicians to find clinical trials at our institution. The intranet version helps us manage our clinical trials, e.g. by keeping all required documents in one place, keeping track of the patients registered in clinical trials, and serious adverse event reporting. And I don't see why clinical researchers can't adopt the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://pantonprinciples.org/">Panton Principles</a> – which endorse that data related to published science should be explicitly placed in the public domain – whenever possible.</p>

<p>Last Monday I was listening to a very interesting presentation by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/ian-rowlands/">Ian Rowlands</a>, reader in scholarly communication in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.infostudies.ucl.ac.uk/">Department of Information Studies</a> at University College London. He and his colleagues are interested in how researchers find and use information, and how this has changed with the internet, especially for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/resourcediscovery/googlegen.aspx">Google Generation</a> (people born after 1993). If you want to be part in this research (and have some fun), you can take part in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/webbehaviour">BBC Web Behaviour Test</a>. The test will help you discover which species of web animal you are (I'm a <strong><strong>fox</strong></strong>).</p>

<p>In another project, funded by the Research Information Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.rin.ac.uk/">RIN</a>), Ian and his colleagues are studying how researchers are using electronic journals. The findings of the first part of the project were presented and discussed in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.rin.ac.uk/news/events/e-journals-revolution-how-use-scholarly-journals-shaping-research">workshop last July</a>. The presentations are available as PDF download, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.rin.ac.uk/resources/rin-publications/podcasts/e-journals-revolution-podcast">podcast</a> with interviews of the speakers. The findings were summarized in a paper also published last July: <strong><strong>Online use and information seeking behaviour: institutional and subject comparisons of UK researchers</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In the paper, the use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://www.oxfordjournals.org/">Oxford Journals</a> by 10 major UK research institutions was analyzed in the fields of life sciences, economics and history, using the server logs for the full year 2007. Some of the key findings of the study include:</p>
<h3 id="one-third-of-users-access-oxford-journals-outside-business-hours">One third of users access Oxford Journals outside business hours</h3>
<p>9.7% of uses happened on a Saturday/Sunday and 30.1% between 6 PM and 9 AM. This means that about one third of users accessed Oxford Journals outside typical business hours, either working late or from home (the study didn't distinguish between these two). These numbers indicate that remote access (from home, but probably also when traveling) is important for many users. This is obviously not an issue for Open Access journals, but institutions need to provide practical solutions (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a>, etc.) for subscription journals. From personal experience this remote access is still overly complicated. And these numbers also mean that librarians will not be available for support questions one third of the time.</p>
<h3 id="around-40-of-sessions-originated-from-a-google-search">Around 40% of sessions originated from a Google Search</h3>
<p>In 2004 Oxford Journals opened up to Google for indexing. I didn't expect this important role that Google seems to play in finding scholarly papers, and I would be very interested in feedback from blog readers. Only 4% of sessions originated from Google Scholar (22% in economics). These results probably explain why Google Scholar hasn't seen that much development since it was launched. The search function at Oxford Journals was rarely used.</p>
<p>43% of users of history journals, but only 16% of users of life sciences journals used navigational tools (table of contents, etc.) provided by the journal. This statistic obviously doesn't look at users getting the table of contents via email or RSS, but it again shows that access via search now probably is more common than via browsing.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/08/evaluating_usage_patterns_of_online_journals/#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="most-users-spend-little-time-on-journal-webpages-but-return-often">Most users spend little time on journal webpages, but return often</h3>
<p>The average number of articles viewed per session was 1.1, and the average session time was just over 4 minutes. Users rather return often, usually via a search. These numbers indicate that journal webpages are not a place where users spend a lot of time. Unless journals change this (e.g. by more active involvement of users via comments and other social networking features, etc.), they probably can't expect to generate significant revenue from online advertising. The internet has not only dramatically changed the role of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists-and-librarians-friend-or-foe">libraries</a>, but also for journals, as users are mostly interested in single articles, rather than the journal as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="the-median-age-of-articles-was-48-months-life-sciences-73-months-economics-and-90-months-history-">The median age of articles was 48 months (life sciences), 73 months (economics), and 90 months (history)</h3>
<p>In the life sciences only 25% of the articles were no more than 16 months old, but another 25% were over 104 months old. I would have expected that the median age of articles would be much lower in the life sciences (it was two years in a similar study with ScienceDirect<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/08/evaluating_usage_patterns_of_online_journals/#fn2">2</a>). It seems as if most papers are not accessed when they are published (in the first few months after publication), but rather as the result of a search strategy, e.g. when writing a paper.</p>
<h3 id="life-sciences-users-rarely-read-abstracts-on-publisher-platforms">Life sciences users rarely read abstracts on publisher platforms</h3>
<p>This should not come as a surprise, as life sciences users typically read abstracts in specialized databases, particularly <strong><strong>PubMed</strong></strong>. But maybe Journal publishers should stop displaying papers in an abstract view, saving users and themselves some effort. <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals don't have an abstract view, but the <em><em>Biomed Central</em></em> journals (which are also Open Access) do. Subscription journals (including <em><em>Nature</em></em>) typically display the abstract instead of full-text to users without subscription access, so there is also no need for a separate abstract view for them.</p>
<p>The number of PDF views was higher than the number of full-text HTML views (178,152 vs. 106,582). This difference was much more pronounced in economics and history journals, probably indicating that here most papers were printed out and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102310/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/10/how-do-you-read-papers-2010-will-be-different">not read on the computer</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Tuesday the <em><em>German Research Foundation</em></em> (DFG) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.dfg.de/en/service/press/press_releases/2010/pressemitteilung_nr_07/index.html">announced</a> changes to the grant application process, going in effect in July. Researchers are no longer allowed to list all their publications in their grant proposals. The number of publications is limited to five per researcher and to two per year of planned funding (e.g. 6 papers for a 3-year grant). Publications submitted but not yet accepted for publication will no longer be allowed.</p>

</figure>
<p>Some of the reasoning behind this change was explained in the press conference where the policy change was announced. The DFG wants to put more emphasis on quality instead of quantity, in other words counteract the trend to publish several small pieces of incremental research findings (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/01/repost_thoughts_on_the_least_p.php">least publishable unit</a> or <em><em>LPU</em></em>). The DFG didn't say so, but this might also reduce the practice of “honorary coauthorship” with some researchers being coauthors of 20 or even 50 papers per year. And the DFG is not happy with the increasing use of the Journal Impact Factor and other metrics as a token measure for the quality of research output. And as a reaction to problems with publication lists in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,622474,00.html">G&amp;Atilde;¶ttingen</a> they want to stop the practice of including unpublished work in reference lists for grant applications.</p>
<p>These changes will decrease the administrative workload of the applicant, reviewer and the DFG. With much shorter reference lists in grant applications, reviewers will have it much easier to take a closer look at the research output of the applicant, instead of relying on an unfortunate proxy such as the <em><em>Journal Impact Factor</em></em>. Researchers seeking funding from the DFG will now probably be more likely to write fewer but more substantial papers. And research that doesn't have the potential for a substantial paper, but is nevertheless worth publishing, can be quickly published in a reasonable journal instead of going through several rounds of submissions to a number of journals.</p>
<p>But how do you select your five best publications (assuming you have written more than five)? Choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>publication date, e.g. a list of the five most recent publications</li>
<li>Journal Impact Factor</li>
<li>citation counts, page views, downloads or other article-level metrics</li>
<li>personal preference</li>
</ul>
<p>Using my personal preference (and not too much thought), I picked four papers and one correspondence:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>Shioda T, Fenner MH, Isselbacher KJ</em></em> Msg1, a novel melanocyte-specific gene, encodes a nuclear protein and is associated with pigmentation. <em><em>PNAS</em></em> 1996 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC37985/?tool=pubmed">PubMed Central</a><br />
The first paper from my postdoctoral research project. We identified and cloned a new gene thought to be involved in cancer metastasis, using a technology called differential display to compare the gene expression profile of two melanoma cell lines. This was before the mouse and human genomes were sequenced, and before microarrays became available. What took us two years of work 15 years ago can now probably be done in a few weeks.</li>
<li><em><em>Sado T, Fenner MH, Tan SS Tam P, Shioda T, Li E</em></em> X Inactivation in the Mouse Embryo Deficient for Dnmt1: Distinct Effect of Hypomethylation on Imprinted and Random X Inactivation. <em><em>Dev Biol</em></em> 2000 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/dbio.2000.9823">doi:10.1006/dbio.2000.9823</a><br />
I spent most of my time as a post-doc generating a knockout mouse for the gene identified in the previous paper. As the knockout mouse had no obvious phenotype, it took another post-doc (the first author) to finish the project.</li>
<li><em><em>Krege S et al.</em></em> European consensus conference on diagnosis and treatment of germ cell cancer: a report of the second meeting of the European Germ Cell Cancer Consensus group (EGCCCG): part I. <em><em>Eur Urol</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2007.12.024">doi:10.1016/j.eururo.2007.12.024</a><br />
This paper summarizes the conclusions of a consensus conference on the diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer, and is the best review on the subject. I am one of over 80 coauthors, something I haven't done before or since. The journal published this as two papers because of length. This would have been a perfect paper for an Open Access journal, I hope I can convince the coauthors to do so when we update this in 2011.</li>
<li><em><em>Fenner MH, Beutel G, Gruenwald V.</em></em> Targeted therapies for patients with germ cell tumors. <em><em>Expert Opin Investig Drugs</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://dx.doi.org/10.1517/13543784.17.4.511">doi:10.1517/13543784.17.4.511</a><br />
Testicular cancer is one of the few chemotherapy success stories, as most patients with advanced metastatic disease can be cured. Targeted therapies have become important treatment options in many cancers. This is the first review to look at the evidence for the use of targeted therapies in testicular cancer.</li>
<li><em><em>Fenner MH.</em></em> Duplication: stop favouring applicant with longest list. <em><em>Nature</em></em> 2008 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/452029a">doi:10.1038/452029a</a><br />
This is a <em><em>Nature</em></em> correspondence, included here only to show that comments made in a Nature Network forum can end up in <em><em>Nature</em></em>. And because it is relevant to this blog post, as I suggested to <em><em>ask applicants to select their best three, five or ten papers</em></em> instead of giving grants or jobs to those with the longest publication list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wellcome Trust last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/investigator-awards/Implementation/index.htm">announced</a> a different change to they grant application process. Starting later this year, they will stop accepting proposals for project grants, and rather evaluate the reaseach output of the scientist asking for funding (<em><em>Investigator Awards</em></em>). They argue that researchers that alrady have shown excellence in the past shoudn't be burdened with the administrative overhead and restrictions of writing a detailed project proposal every three years.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how institutions and other research funders in Germany (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.helmholtz.de/en/">Helmholtz</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.wgl.de/">Leibniz</a>) or elsewhere react to this DFG policy change. I would be happy if this is a step towards more reasonable publication policies. And I hope that the upcoming unique author identifier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102053/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> will not be used for even more complicated bibliometric calculations, but rather as a tool for researchers to showcase their most interesting work.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://wikify.org/">Lambert Heller</a> and myself did a two-day workshop <em><em>Reference Management in Times of Web 2.0</em></em> for a group of German librarians. We introduced and tested the following five programs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the workshop was to introduce the participants to the Web 2.0 aspects of these reference managers. We briefly talked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers">Papers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citavi.com/">Citavi</a>, but neither of them offers any Web 2.0 functionality. The goal of the workshop was <em><em>not</em></em> to pick the best reference manager. With the exception of <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> (which is more of a social bookmarking service and can't be used to directly put references into manuscripts), all of them are probably good choices for most users. For some of the minor differences, please check my reference manager chart that I have updated for the workshop (PDF <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.slideshare.net/mfenner/reference-manager-overview-2-1-3250074">here</a>):</p>

</figure>
<p>We had used FriendFeed for the slides, links and comments in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://friendfeed.com/bibman2">similar workshop last July</a>. This time we picked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.sciencefeed.com/">ScienceFeed</a>, both because ScienceFeed can be used for reference management, and to test the service that launched just three days earlier. The ScienceFeed group can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.sciencefeed.com/zblit2">here</a>, but is in German. FriendFeed and ScienceFeed are not only great for conference microblogging, but are also excellent teaching tools, especially in a workshop where every participant has an internet-connected computer. We also had a few people listening in and putting up comments.</p>
<p>The workshop did help me understand what could become one of the most important features of reference managers. (I would exclude <em><em>Endnote</em></em>, because it doesn't allow public groups or sharing of fulltext files). Libraries used to be places where you could find, store and read literature. A library would hold a subset of all the available literature, but still far more texts than an individual could keep at his home. A library serves as an intermediary that helps the user get access to the literature he is interested in.</p>
<p>A reference manager that stores all references and the associated fulltext PDF files in an accessible (public or password-protected) place can fullfill exactly the same role. It is not necessary that an individual user stores every reference and fulltext paper on his own computer. And he doesn't have to find all references for himself. Librarians could help with this, e.g. by not only handling a users search request, but also filing the associated PDF files in a group folder. Other group folders would have the table of contents of your favorite journals (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citeulike.org/journals">CiteULike Journals</a>). We used to go to the library for exactly these things. And now we do this all on our own, often not asking for help from our local library.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the last session I talked about non-traditional ways to find scientific literature. Traditional would mean one of the following search strategies, summarized by Duncan Hull et al.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/02/22/there_is_still_so_much_to_learn_in_reference_management/#fn1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>Search</em></em> – Search bibliographic databases</li>
<li><em><em>Browse</em></em> – Scan tables of contents</li>
<li>Recommend – Recommendations by colleagues</li>
</ul>
<p><em><em>Twitter</em></em> is just a modern tool for strategies <em><em>#2</em></em> (check the Twitter list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://twitter.com/mfenner/science-journals">@mfenner/science-journals</a> for some science journals using Twitter to announce interesting articles) and <em><em>#3</em></em> (papers recommended by friends you talk to via Twitter).</p>
<p>The non-traditional approach basically lets other people do the work for you. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experts pick noteworthy papers in your field – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.f1000.com/">Faculty of 1000</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.researchblogging.org/">Research Blogging</a>.</li>
<li>You follow what people with similar interests are reading – <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> and <em><em>Mendeley</em></em></li>
<li>Recommendations based on what is in your library – <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://blog.citeulike.org/?p=136">CiteULike recommendations</a></li>
<li>Most popular articles in your research field of interest – <em><em>CiteULike</em></em> and <em><em>Mendeley</em></em>. The <em><em>PLoS</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.plos.org/cms/node/485">article-level metrics</a> have the potential to do the same.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microblogging is blogging of short text messages, photos or other media and is best exemplified by <em><em>Twitter</em></em>. Twitter use has grown tremendously in 2009, and this also includes many scientists.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/02/15/sciencefeed_interview_with_ijad_madisch/#fn1">1</a></sup> <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> is a another microblogging tool that not only allows sending of short text messages, but connects them together in groups and discussions threads similar to what you can do in online forums. FriendFeed, especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://friendfeed.com/the-life-scientists">The Life Scientists</a> group has been a popular place for many scientists for the last 18 months or so. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile">Cameron Neylon</a> wrote a good introduction to the service back in June 2008: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/06/12/friendfeed-for-scientists-what-why-and-how/">FriendFeed for scientists: what, why, and how?</a>. FriendFeed is a great tool for conference blogging, and the ISBM 2008 conference was probably the first scientific conference where it was used extensively, resulting in a <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> paper.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/02/15/sciencefeed_interview_with_ijad_madisch/#fn2">2</a></sup> FriendFeed is also often used to comment on blog posts, and here it is competing for attention with comments that are put directly on a blog. FriendFeed is a good example for a generic Web 2.0 tool that is much more useful to scientists than many Web 2.0 tools targeted specifically at scientists (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://fcw.com/Articles/2009/10/26/NIH-grant-creates-Facebook-for-Scientists.aspx">Facebooks for scientists</a>).</p>
<p>FriendFeed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=116581">was acquired by Facebook</a> in August 2009, and users started to worry about the long-term future of FriendFeed. An Open Source version of the FriendFeed web server was recently released as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://bret.appspot.com/entry/tornado-web-server">Tornado</a> (source code on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://github.com/facebook/tornado">GitHub</a>). Although other services (including <em><em>Facebook</em></em>) offer similar functionality, no service has (yet) emerged as an alternative popular with scientists. FriendFeed use seemed to be declining at the two recent <em><em>Science Online London 2009</em></em> and <em><em>ScienceOnline2010</em></em> conferences, as more and more people were using Twitter.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.google.com/buzz">Google Buzz</a> was released. <em><em>Buzz</em></em> is also a microblogging service, tightly integrated with <em><em>Google Mail</em></em> and <em><em>Google Reader</em></em>. If offers many of the same features as <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, and because it integrates with Google Mail, it has a large number of potential users from the start – including a large number of people involved in the Science Bloggosphere. <em><em>Buzz</em></em> will certainly get some of the features that are still missing, e.g. an easy way to import content from other sources, including a bookmarklet. And <em><em>Buzz</em></em> works very well on iPhone and Android phones and there also uses location information – e.g. all the <em><em>Buzz</em></em> discussions near you. But at the moment many people wonder how best to integrate <em><em>Buzz</em></em> with <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> and <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, and all the other online tools they use – it doesn't make sense to read the same content again and again on all these services.</p>
<p>In this context it is very interesting to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.sciencefeed.com/">ScienceFeed</a> launching as a new microblogging service this week. <em><em>ScienceFeed</em></em> in many ways is similar to <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, but tries to add features of particular interest to scientists. I spoke with <em><em>Ijad Madisch</em></em> about ScienceFeed.</p>

<h3 id="1-what-is-sciencefeed">1. What is ScienceFeed?</h3>
<p>ScienceFeed is science as it happens, communicated through a microblogging platform. Conceptualized and designed by scientists, it is a bridge between online scientific networking platforms, scientific databases, and the wider online science community. The ScienceFeed platform allows users to post microblogs, sometimes just a few sentences, on scientific headlines, new findings, controversy, conferences and ideas related to science. Community members can follow the feeds of fellow members and comment on topics in which they are interested, allowing real-time communication and transfer of ideas.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/sciencefeed_screenshot/web.jpg" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>ScienceFeed is an interactive and dynamic platform – like science itself. Here, scientists, journalists, librarians, students, and those with an interest in science, will be able to communicate in a way that has no borders. Individuals from all over the world are able to participate and observe, helping to make science accessible to all. Integral to the concept of Science 2.0 is having online resources that are archivable and searchable – ScienceFeed will do just this. Science is not limited to the laboratory: it happens through interactions of communities. ScienceFeed is excited to build such a community.</p>
<h3 id="2-how-is-sciencefeed-different-from-friendfeed">2. How is ScienceFeed different from FriendFeed?</h3>
<p>In basic functionality, ScienceFeed isn't much different to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://friendfeed.com/the-life-scientists">FriendFeed</a>. However, I think with the help of the community we will develop and add applications to the platform that could make it very efficient for scientific communication. There are two differences from FriendFeed which we have already implemented: 1) Specific scientific publications can easily be searched for and then entered as a linked-in reference within a feed, and, 2) Groups can be marked as an event (e.g. a conference). My vision is to have event streams in ScienceFeed, which then can be visualized and presented in a much better way. However, the most important part is that we listen to the feedback of the community and develop specific applications based on their ideas and feedback.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-special-features-does-sciencefeed-provide-for-conference-microblogging">3. What special features does ScienceFeed provide for conference microblogging</h3>
<p>An important feature from ScienceFeed is that groups can be marked as a specific event, such as a conference. Administrators of these groups will be able to import hashtags from Twitter, so all tweets will be aggregated and displayed within this group. A possibility for future growth is the integration of an entire conference program (sessions, panels, etc.) into the group, which then can be commented on by group members. It is important to us that the scientific community has an input into the development of this feature so that we can build a stronger, more efficient platform based on the needs of our users.</p>
<h3 id="4-can-you-import-references-into-sciencefeed-only-via-your-reference-database-or-also-via-citeulike-or-other-bookmarking-service">4. Can you import references into ScienceFeed only via your reference database, or also via CiteULike or other bookmarking service?</h3>
<p>Martin, thank you so much for this great idea. Based on your feedback we worked hard to make this happen before launch. Yes, now ScienceFeed can import from other bookmarking services such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteUlike</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</a>. Furthermore ScienceFeed supports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.oclc.org/productworks/coins.htm">CoiNS</a>, which identifies automatically based on a weblink whether or not bibliographic data is in the specified URL.</p>
<h3 id="5-how-is-sciencefeed-different-from-twitter">5. How is ScienceFeed different from Twitter?</h3>
<p>There are several differences, but the largest are that in ScienceFeed there is no character limitation and groups can be tagged as a specific event – facilitating real-time, online communication about the event.</p>
<h3 id="6-what-is-the-advantage-of-having-a-social-networking-tool-specifically-for-scientists">6. What is the advantage of having a social networking tool specifically for scientists?</h3>
<p>I think the most important part is the non-dilution of information in an environment where the platform and focus is specifically on science. Consider the following: You can find a biomedical scientific paper by searching in Google, but you could also use PubMed, which has a high probability of faster and better results. It is the same as within <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGATE</a>: You have large groups (Methods, Immunology, Neuroscience, Philosophy, etc.) with a very focused population, which again makes your search more directed and efficient with better results.</p>
<h3 id="7-what-is-the-relationship-between-sciencefeed-and-researchgate">7. What is the relationship between ScienceFeed and ResearchGATE?</h3>
<p>ScienceFeed will be a scientific microblogging platform completely autonomous from ResearchGATE, because I think they target the same group, but with various usage patterns.</p>
<p>The publication reference tool used for inserting papers into ScienceFeed accesses the custom-built database of ResearchGATE. This database now has a public API which makes it possible for everyone to connect to the ResearchGATE literature database. I think that microarticles which are pretty successful in Researchgate (published in our ResearchBLOG) could be a part of ScienceFeed as well. I see ScienceFeed as a platform which will be useful to various scientific platforms as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/http://www.academia.edu/">Academia</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGATE</a>, etc. It could be a platform that helps connect all these different platforms.</p>
<h3 id="8-will-there-be-a-publicly-available-api-for-sciencefeed">8. Will there be a publicly available API for ScienceFeed?</h3>
<p>Yes, there will be an API.</p>
<h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-in-sciencefeed">9. What are your responsibilities in ScienceFeed?</h3>
<p>I am, as in ResearchGATE, one of the co-founders and a kind of CEO. I want to build a team of innovative and forward-thinking individuals to help develop ideas and work conceptually on the future directions of ScienceFeed.</p>
<h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-working-on-sciencefeed">10. What did you do before working on ScienceFeed?</h3>
<p>I am a co-founder and CEO of ResearchGATE and I am also working at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, in Boston as a researcher. Before ResearchGATE I studied Medicine and Computer Science and completed my doctoral thesis in Virology, while working for some time in Gastroenterology as a medical doctor.</p>
<h3 id="11-could-you-provide-contact-information-for-people-that-have-further-questions-about-sciencefeed">11. Could you provide contact information for people that have further questions about ScienceFeed?</h3>
<p>I can be contacted anytime at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032951/mailto:ijad.madisch@sciencefeed.com">ijad.madisch@sciencefeed.com</a>.</p>

<p>I have had many, many positive experiences in these 2 1/2 years. I learned a lot about science publishing and met a large number of very nice and very clever people both online and offline. I wrote about 160 blog posts and an uncounted number of comments during that time, and writing blog posts is still a lot of fun and something I like doing on a regular basis (I decided a while ago to aim for one blog post per week). I am also excited about the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031820/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London 2010</a> meeting, although the exact date and location have not yet been set.</p>
<p>Happy birthday.</p>

The application gives access to the full text of all <em><em>Nature</em></em> and <em><em>Nature News</em></em> content (through until 30 April 2010, how access is handled afterwards hasn't been announced yet). A version for the <em><em>Android</em></em> platform was promised for April, and the app will work with the just-announced <em><em>iPad</em></em>. I included a few screenshots for those without an iPhone or iPod Touch. A free Nature.com personal account is needed to use the app.</p>

</figure>
<p>The iPhone app doesn't use HTML or PDF but rather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html">the ePub format</a>. The Nature.com website will soon offer downloads in ePub format (an example article is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/article.epub">here</a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">Adobe Digital Editions</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a> are examples of ePub readers. In contrast to PDF, ePub adapts to the screen size and is therefore a much better format for the iPhone.</p>

<p>References are links in the text, clicking on them opens a new window.</p>

<p>Figures are also links in the text that open in a new window. The figures can be saved to the iPhone Photos application.</p>

</figure>
<p>The iPhone app also gives access to the full text of <em><em>Nature News</em></em>. In contrast to <em><em>Nature</em></em> papers, images are rendered within the text.</p>

</figure>
<p><em><em>Nature</em></em> and <em><em>Nature News</em></em> content, as well as PubMed search results can be saved for later reading. This content (or rather the <em><em>DOI</em></em>) is also available from the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/mobileapps/web/bookmarks">Nature.com mobile apps</a> page. Because the <em><em>Nature.com mobile apps</em></em> page stores only the <em><em>DOI</em></em>, a <em><em>Nature</em></em> subscription is required to access the full-text article from there. From the <em><em>Nature.com mobile apps</em></em> page you can also export the citation in <em><em>RIS</em></em> format.</p>
<p>The Nature.com iPhone app also searches both Nature.com and PubMed. Regular searches can be saved.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>PubMed searches will retrieve abstracts, with a link to the full-text article via the <em><em>DOI</em></em>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://mekentosj.com/papers/iphone/">Papers for iPhone</a> is another app that allows PubMed searches. You can also search for the latest <em><em>Nature</em></em> content, but the full-text content is available only with a subscription and only as HTML or PDF.</p>

</figure>
<p>Support for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.web-books.com/Publishing/epub.htm">ePub</a> is the most exiting feature for me, as it opens the door for many interesting mobile applications. I hope that more scientific journals will start to use the format (Hindawi was one of the first publishers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">to support ePub</a>), and that we then start to see mobile apps for more than a single journal.</p>
<p>Bug reports, suggestions and feature requests can be sent to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/mailto:mobile%40nature.com">mobile@nature.com</a>.

<p>As we have moved to digital formats both for primary research data and scientific publications, digital preservation has become critical to secure permanent access to scientific information. Digital preservation turned out to be much more difficult than creating digital content, as preservation requires long-term thinking about many issues including file formats, storage solutions and funding. Digital preservation turned out to be too big for individual libraries, publishers or research disciplines, and large collaborative efforts were started in the last five years.</p>
<h3 id="alliance-for-permanent-access">Alliance for Permanent Access</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.alliancepermanentaccess.eu/">Alliance for Permanent Access</a> is a European strategic framework for digital preservation of scientific information. The alliance coordinates the efforts of different funders, research support organizations and major European research laboratories (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://public.web.cern.ch/">CERN</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.esa.int/esaCP/index.html">ESA</a>).</p>

The deadline for proposals was May 2009, and $100 million will be awarded over the next five years. Wow.</p>
<h3 id="portico">Portico</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.portico.org/">Portico</a> is a not-for-profit digital preservation service for scholarly content. Portico was launched in 2005 with initial support by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.ithaka.org/">Ithaka</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. The Portico archive currently contains close to 15 million papers and is archiving journal content for many publishers and libraries for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.portico.org/publishers/pub_contribution.html">fee</a>. Portico steps in (a so-called trigger event) when a publisher</p>
<ul>
<li>stops operations</li>
<li>ceases to publish a title</li>
<li>no longer offers back issues</li>
<li>has a castastrophic failure of the delivery platform</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="file-formats">File formats</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.pdfa.org/">PDF/A</a> was approved as an ISO standard for long-term archiving of electronic documents in 2005. Before PDF/A, many organizations (including our institution) used the raster graphics format TIFF. The major advantage of the PDF format is the handling text and vector graphics in addition to raster images, allowing full-text search and smaller file sizes. Because the PDFformat is constantly changing, PDF/A was based on a specific PDF version (1.4) with the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-contained, no external images or fonts</li>
<li>no sound or movies</li>
<li>metadata in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP</a> format</li>
<li>no password protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Most scientific papers are now produced in XML, usually using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM DTD</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/">Archiving and Interchange Tag Set</a> is a flavor of the NLM DTD that is intented for archiving.</p>
<h3 id="storage-solutions">Storage solutions</h3>
<p>Hard disks, tape and optical media are possible storage solutions. Tape is the ideal solution for long-term storage of research papers, but the digital preservation of research data in many areas (e.g. sequencing, high-energy physics) can’t be done with tape because of the exponential growth of these data. Hard disk storage has another problem: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/wellcome-trust-sanger-institute-upgrade-sequencing-capacity-unveils-annual-revie">energy requirements of data centers</a>.</p>
<p>We live in a digital world, and this of course includes how we do and communicate science. It is surprising that we have barely started to think about digital preservation.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following the <em><em>ScienceOnlin</em>e<em>2010</em></em> conference, librarian Dorothea Salo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://scienceblogs.com/bookoftrogool/2010/01/science_online_2010_scientists.php">wrote on her blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
This disconnect is the number one threat to science librarianship today – perhaps to all academic librarianship. How can science libraries persist when scientists haven't the least notion that libraries or librarians are relevant to their work?
</blockquote>
<p>These are serious questions, and of course I don't have the answers. But I would like to add my thoughts from a researcher perspective. The role of libraries in providing teaching material for students (textbooks, etc.) is another story that I will not touch today.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/11th/101350718_fa52fcef35.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="500" height="349" alt="Flickr image by Radioher" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Flickr image by Radioher</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm old enough to remember the time (maybe 15 years ago) before literature searches were possible via the internet and scientific papers were available in electronic form. I had to go to the library to use Medline or Current Contents in printed form (and later on CD-ROM), or to flip through the newest issues of the most interesting journals. I would photocopy the papers I would then read at home, and then file away for later use.</p>
<p><em><em>PubMed</em></em>, <em><em>Scopus</em></em>, <em><em>Web of Science</em></em>, and <em><em>Google Scholar</em></em> now allow me to search the literature from my desk at work (or from home). Most researchers (including myself) probably don't have the skills for sophisticated searches, but these tools <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/blog/2008/03/22/i-am-not-yelling-not-out-loud">more or less</a> get the job done. Electronic publishing means that I can obtain a paper directly from the journal (as long as I access the journal from a computer in the university network), and licensing is handled (almost) transparently by the library.</p>
<p>These developments have dramatically reduced the time researchers spend at a library. This is good, as this saves them a lot time. But interactions between researchers and librarians have also been dramatically reduced. Publishers and other companies (e.g. <em><em>Thomson Reuters</em></em>, <em><em>Mendeley</em></em>, <em><em>Faculty of 1000</em></em>, to name just a few) have used the opportunities to adapt their offerings to the internet (e.g. electronic-only journals), and to create new products that weren't possible (or even thinkable) before. Although libraries have in many ways adapted to the internet as well, they probably haven't seized the opportunity to the same degree. The homepage of my university library is a place I visit much less often than <em><em>PubMed</em></em> or the pages of my favorite journals. Some ideas of how this could be changed are listed below. Most of them are not new, but maybe at least some libraries haven't gone all the way to make their pages an attractive destination for the researchers of their institution.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists_and_librarians_friend_or_foe/#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="provide-and-support-online-reference-manager">Provide and support online reference manager</h3>
<p>Institutions should support at least one online reference manager, possible options include (in no particular order) Zotero, Mendeley, Endnote Web, Refworks and CiteULike. RefWorks and Endnote Web are commercial products and require a private (Endnote) and/or institutional license. The institution should either pick a free reference manager as their primary choice, or buy an institutional license in order to allow every researcher and student to use these tools without additional cost.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists_and_librarians_friend_or_foe/#fn2">2</a></p>
<p>As we can't expect everybody to use the same reference manager, libraries have to help with several products. The easiest way to do so is via an online forum (see next paragraph), as this is more efficient than one-to-one support and allows experienced users to help out. Online reference managers provide additional features (e.g. they can be used from different computers, allow shared folders for groups of users) and should therefore be preferred over standalone applications.</p>
<h3 id="online-user-training-and-support">Online user training and support</h3>
<p>User support is obviously one of the central functions of science libraries. This has two aspects: helping with a specific problem (e.g. finding scientific literature), but also training users to do this on their own. The required skills include use of <em><em>PubMed</em></em> and other databases, and reference managers such as <em><em>Endnote</em></em> or <em><em>Zotero</em></em>. Skills in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> are critical to find and appreciate the appropriate medical literature, but in my experience many physicians and medical students would benefit from additional training in this area.</p>
<p>Introductory classes, help in person or a phone call are sometimes the best way to do this, but often users require quick help for a specific situation that can best done with online tools. Appropriate tools include email, online forum, <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> (a microblogging tool similar to Twitter but for institutions), <em><em>SlideShare</em></em>, <em><em>FaceBook</em></em> (and <em><em>StudiVZ</em></em> in Germany), <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>, and Wikis. Every institution should make a decision about the services they plan to support, with emphasis on tools that are easy to use.</p>
<h3 id="institutional-bibliographies">Institutional bibliographies</h3>
<p>A regularly updated listing of all publications of an institution is not only a valuable PR service, but is often also required by administrations to evaluate research output. Librarians are often involved in this, but there is probably a lot of untapped potential. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">unique identifiers for researchers</a> become more widespread, there really no longer is a need for researchers to compile publication lists themselves.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/24/scientists_and_librarians_friend_or_foe/#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="article-deposition-in-institutional-repositories">Article deposition in institutional repositories</h3>
<p>Most journals allow researchers to post their accepted papers in institutional repositories of their institution. But because this requires technical skills and extra time, many researchers aren't particularly eager to make use of them. Institutional bibliographies can obviously be nicely integrated with institutional repositories, thus reducing redundant work.</p>
<h3 id="help-authors-with-article-submissions">Help authors with article submissions</h3>
<p>Article processing charges for authors are often handled by their libraries, and sometimes libraries have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/libraries/membership">membership deals</a> with publishers that give authors a discount. But researchers often are left alone with the article submission process. Most authors submit at most a handful of papers each year, and they have to deal not only with different article formats between journals (most notably different reference styles), but also different article submission systems (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/25/editorial-manager-interview-with-richard-wynne">Editorial Manager</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://www.ejpress.com/index.shtml">eJournal Press</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://scholarone.com/products/manuscript/">Manuscript Central</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111844/http://benchpress.highwire.org/">BenchPress</a>). The total number of papers submitted by an institution is much larger, and thus at least some recurring problems could be avoided or at least the time required reduced with centralized support from the library.</p>
<h3 id="help-with-web-2-0-tools-for-scientists">Help with Web 2.0 tools for scientists</h3>
<p>Libraries don't have to reinvent all the Web 2.0 tools for scientists that are already out there, but they are a good place to help interested researchers get started with some of them (e.g. <em><em>ResearchGate</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Network</em></em>, or <em><em>Academia.edu</em></em>). Ideally, these tools could be integrated into the library webpages via an API.</p>
<p>fn1. I would like to be proven wrong by great examples of libraries gone Web 2.0.</p>
<p>fn2. My university picked <em><em>RefWorks</em></em> as their primary reference manager.</p>
<p>fn3. <em><em>Scopus</em></em> is already pretty good in this.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://network.nature.com/people/steelgraham/profile">Graham Steel</a> has more experience attending ScienceOnline remotely (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://mcblawg.blogspot.com/2009/01/science-online-09-how-was-it-via.html">Science Online '09 – How was it…. via the internet?</a>), but I did my best to follow the meeting via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23scio10">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://friendfeed.com/scienceonline2010">FriendFeed</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=scio10">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23scio10">YouTube</a> and of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/BlogMedia_Coverage/">blogs and media</a>. There was even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://scienceblogs.com/scienceonline/2010/01/scienceonline2010_iphone_app.php">ScienceOnline2010 iPhone app</a>. Another ScienceOnline2010 trend was the widespread use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.theflip.com/">Flip</a> for short videos such as this one:</p>
<p>The overall online coverage far exceeds what I see at my usual science meetings, but following the sessions live (including the ability to ask questions) is far more difficult. For that you need video and microblogging (or the two combined in <em><em>Second Life</em></em>). Video of sessions from two rooms was streamed live at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/scienceonline2010">Ustream</a> and <em><em>Second Life</em></em>, but Ustream didn't always work for me (didn't try Second Life, all sessions were recorded and will appear on <em><em>YouTube</em></em> next week).</p>
<p>For me and many others <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> is the perfect microblogging tool for conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">Microblogging the ISMB: A New Approach to Conference Reporting</a>). But the use of <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> in Science 2.0 conferences seems on the decline during the last 12 months because of <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, and at <em><em>ScienceOnline2010</em></em> it was no longer possible to follow sessions using <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>. <em><em>Twitter</em></em> is wonderful for many things, but makes it very difficult to create a connected discussion around a particular topic such as a conference session. But the <em><em>Twitter</em></em> board was cool:</p>

<p>After <em><em>ScienceOnline2010</em></em> is before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London 2010</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://blog.f1000.com/2010/01/15/on-the-run&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;15jan10/">first planning meeting</a> took place last Friday. We hope to announce the location and date in the coming weeks, but we are aiming for a bigger (with enough room for at least 250 people) and longer (two days) meeting with enough parallel sessions to cover all the topics that we care about.</p>
<p>One personal goal I have for <em><em>Science Online London 2010</em></em> is to provide an even better experience for those unable to attend in person. <em><em>Second Life</em></em> worked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://network.nature.com/people/joannascott/blog/2009/09/07/science-online-london-links">pretty well</a> for us last year, and we even had one speaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/telepresent_at_the_future/">giving his presentation</a> this way. But maybe we can do better. Livestreaming of good quality audio is probably the most important thing, the video quality seems less critical. Alternatively, we can synchronize the audio with the slides from the presentation, something <em><em>SlideShare</em></em> calls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast">SlideCast</a>. We might also find better ways to use <em><em>Twitter</em></em> for microblogging, e.g. by using separate hashtags for every session and a <em><em>Twitter</em></em> board in the sessions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In November 2008 I wrote a blog post called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/02/how-do-you-read-papers">How do you read papers?</a> The blog post was actually about different strategies to <em><em>find</em></em> interesting papers, e.g. browsing journal tables of content (TOC), different search strategies, filtering by papers others read, or filtering by experts (e.g. <em><em>Faculty of 1000</em></em>). A paper by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/duncan/profile">Duncan Hull</a> et al. published around that time in <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000204">Defrosting the Digital Library: Bibliographic Tools for the Next Generation Web</a>) also talked about finding strategies and the best tools for this.</p>
<p>In this blog post I want to talk about the actual reading of scientific papers that you found with one of the strategies mentioned above. There are some interesting recent developments, and I think we will see some significant changes in how we read papers in 2010.</p>
<h3 id="printed-journal">Printed journal</h3>
<p>Holding the printed journal in your hands is probably still the most satisfying reading experience because of professional typesetting and color reproduction. But unless you have a personal journal subscription, it is not convenient as you would have to go to the library to read the paper. Plus, many journals no longer produce a printed version, or the library has only an electronic subscription.</p>
<h3 id="photocopy">Photocopy</h3>
<p>This used to be the most common way to read papers 20 years ago. But the quality of photocopies is usually worse than a printout of an electronic version, and photocopies are far more inconvenient to obtain. Reading photocopied papers will only be necessary for the small number of journals that produce no electronic version, or for older papers.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="pdf-printout">PDF printout</h3>
<p>This is the way most people read scientific papers today, unless they just want to look up small parts of it. Quality color printers have become affordable, and the reading experience is similar to the printed journal with the added convenience of electronic distribution. Most people use PDF printouts for reading, and later discard the paper copy, sometimes even the same day. This is not only more expensive than reading on an electronic device, but also not very friendly to the environment.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="reading-pdfs-on-a-computer">Reading PDFs on a computer</h3>
<p>This approach appears to be very common for reading just parts of a paper, e.g. to look up experimental details, a figure or reference. Most people now store papers as PDF (hopefully with an intelligent program such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a>) and not the PDF printouts. Looking at the PDF on the screen is therefore often the first step, and then the decision is made whether or not to print out the paper to read it in more detail. Reading PDFs on screen is possible, but not really convenient for longer texts. Screen sizes are often too small for the PDF format (A4 or US letter). Many people don't like the eye strain from looking at a screen for longer periods of time, although this is probably more relevant for reading books rather than reading a scientific paper.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://getutopia.com/documents/overview">Utopia</a> is a PDF viewer launched in December by the University of Manchester that enhances PDF files of the <em><em>Semantic Biochemical Journal</em></em> with interactive content and live linking to web resources. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://duncan.hull.name/2009/12/11/utopia/">Read more about Utopia</a> at <em><em>Duncan Hull</em></em>'s blog.</p>
<h3 id="reading-on-a-mobile-device">Reading on a mobile device</h3>
<p>Many mobile devices such as the iPhone can open PDFs and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://mekentosj.com/papers/iphone/">Papers for iPhone</a> makes this process convenient. But PDFs in an A4 or US letter format are almost impossible to read on a small screen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://river-valley.tv/epub-is-the-only-format-we-need/">ePub format</a> is more suitable for smaller screens found on mobile devices. ePub is usually used for e-Books, but the Open Access publisher Hindawi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">since 2008 provides papers also in that format</a>. Although ePub is more suitable than PDF for mobile devices, it doesn't solve the problem that figures and tables are simply difficult to show on a small screen. Mobile devices are probably great for reading journal table of contents or the abstract of a paper (and an RSS reader such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswireiphone/default.aspx">NetNewsWire for iPhone</a> is perfect for this), but not fulltext papers.</p>
<h3 id="reading-on-an-e-reader">Reading on an e-Reader</h3>
<p>The screen of an e-Reader uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://river-valley.tv/electronic-paper-technology/">electronic ink</a> which not only means a much longer battery life, but also a very pleasing reading experience, including reading in direct sunlight. Electronic ink is black &amp; white, which is not a problem for fiction books, but limits the use for scholarly papers (and scientific textbooks). Ideally an e-Reader should have a 10″ screen, similar in size to A4 or US letter paper.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/07/how-big-can-the-kindle-get/">Kindle DX</a> from Amazon was announced in May 2009 and is currently the most popular e-Reader. The Kindle uses its own file format, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=200324680">recent software update</a> now allows the Kindle to open PDF files. Some journals (e.g. the <em><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></em>) offer Kindle subscriptions, but that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://patrickmd.net/blog/2009/05/22/cancelled-kindle-subscription-to-nejm/">doesn't include early release articles</a> and no subscriber access to the journal website. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/technology/personaltech/09reader.html">number of similar devices</a> were demonstrated this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The Kindle is primarily an e-Book reader, and <em><em>David Crotty</em></em> over on the Scholarly Kitchen blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/01/06/doing-the-kindle-math-does-amazons-opacity-conceal-a-shameful-truth">is skeptical</a> about dedicated e-readers, because he thinks that market is just too small.</p>
<h3 id="apple-islate">Apple iSlate</h3>
<p>Unless you have been on a remote island for the last three months, you will know that Apple will announce a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/the_tablet">tablet computer</a> later this month. There is wide speculation about the technical details, but it looks like this will be a very interesting device for reading scholarly papers. In contrast to e-Readers it will not use electronic ink. This means a shorter battery life, but allows color documents and many other more traditional computer uses. Based on the iPod and iPhone experience, many people think that the iSlate will change the way we use tablet computers. One of them is <em><em>Kent Anderson</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/10/02/game-over-man-has-the-disruption-of-publishing-already-occurred/">Game Over, Man – Has the Disruption of Publishing Already Occurred?</a>).</p>
<p>Sports Illustrated did a very nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/magazine/12/02/tablet/index.html">demo of a fictional tablet computer</a> in December, and it is obvious that many of these concepts can also be applied to scholarly publishing.</p>
<h3 id="reading-web-pages">Reading Web Pages</h3>
<p>Most examples mentioned above try to reproduce the experience of reading something printed on paper on an electronic device. An alternative approach would move beyond the traditional format of a paper and rather takes advantage of the electronic medium. And it looks like the web technologies HTML5 and Flash are best suited for this. Cell Press was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like">experimenting with this approach</a> in 2009, and officially launched their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://beta.cell.com/index.php/2010/01/cell-launches-article-of-the-future-format/">Article of the Future</a> with the first 2010 issue of Cell (all papers will be available without subscription for 60 days, you can provide feedback <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://beta.cell.com/index.php/feedback-cell-press-new-article-format/">here</a>). The basic idea of the Article of the Future is to break away from the concept of reading a paper from beginning to end, and to make navigation between the different parts of a paper much easier.</p>
<p>Whereas the <em><em>Article of the Future</em></em> tries to make navigation with a paper easier, the <em><em>PLoS</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/15/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">article-level metrics</a> help with navigating to related content: citations, blog posts, reader comments, etc. The <em><em>Notes</em></em> feature lets registered users highlight text for specific comments – very much what you would do on a printed paper (but with the added benefit that everybody can see this note).</p>
<p>I'm most excited about projects that enhance the scientific paper instead of recreating an exact electronic version of the traditional paper. And HTML is a more promising format than PDF for these approaches. <em><em>Michael Clarke</em></em> (with whom I had the pleasure to do a session at SciFoo 2009) reminded us that <em><em>Tim Berners-Lee</em></em> invented the WWW in 1991 to facilitate scientific communication (with HTML and navigation both within and between documents as central concepts), but papers and journals have changed surprisingly little in the last 18 years (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/01/04/why-hasnt-scientific-publishing-been-disrupted-already/">Why Hasn't Scientific Publishing Been Disrupted Already?</a>).</p>
<p>fn1. Many journals are scanning their older papers and make them available in electronic form, e.g. <em><em>Nature</em></em>. The first issue of <em><em>Nature</em></em> from 1869 can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.nature.com/nature/about/first/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>fn2. We all know that computers haven't brought us the paperless office, but that we all use more paper than 10 years ago.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> stands for <em><em>Open Researcher and Contributor ID</em></em> and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/orcid/media/pdf/ORCID_Announcement.pdf">announced</a> in early December. This blog post tries to summarize some of the problems that have to be solved to develop a unique identifier for scientists.</p>
<h3 id="1-identify-the-problem">1. Identify the problem</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.gen2phen.org/researcher-identification-primer">Researcher Identification Primer</a> by the Gen2Phen Knowledge Center lists some of the problems that a unique identifier for scientists tries to solve, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Disambiguation of author names in the scientific literature and establishing/validating relationships between authors and publications.</li>
<li>A solid foundation for permitting and tracking online scientific contributions, such as database submissions, scientific blogging, and community curation efforts.</li>
<li>Knowledge discovery applications using some or all of the above components.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gen2Phen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.gen2phen.org/event/irbw2009-workshop-may-13-14-toronto">workshop</a> co-organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/U7739E111/profile">Gudmundur Thorisson</a> in May 2009 discussed these issues in much more detail. One of several articles talking about the problem of disambiguation of author names (especially Asian author names) appeared in <em><em>Nature News</em></em> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/451766a">February 2008</a>. A December 2009 <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">editorial</a> emphasized that a unique identifier for researchers will be especially valuable to track scientific contributions that are not related to authoring a paper. Phil Bourne and J. Lynne Fink also wrote about this in PLoS Computational Biology in December 2008: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000247">I Am Not a Scientist, I Am a Number</a>. A number of tools have tried to solve this problem, but it is not possible to link the researcher identities in the many systems.</p>
<h3 id="2-define-what-you-want-to-accomplish">2. Define what you want to accomplish</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/gbilder/profile">Geoff Bilder</a> gave a very good introduction to the problem at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a> in August and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event_presentations.php?event_id=19">STM Innovations</a> in December. Both talks were similar, but the latter is available as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://river-valley.tv/crossref-contributor-id/">video</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Bilder_CrossRef_Contributor_ID.pdf">PDF</a>. He emphasized that ORCID is about <em><em>Knowledge Discovery</em></em> and not <em><em>Access Control</em></em>, and explained the terminology for <em><em>subject</em></em>, <em><em>identifier</em></em>, <em><em>profile</em></em>, <em><em>persona</em></em> and <em><em>credential</em></em>. <em><em>Access Control</em></em> is a related problem that is sometimes mixed in, but there is no requirement that a unique researcher identifier also has to provide secure access via whatever mechanism (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">Open ID</a> is one solution to that problem).</p>
<h3 id="3-win-support-of-stakeholders">3. Win support of stakeholders</h3>
<p>Founding members of the ORCID initiative can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/orcid/gallery.html">found on the ORCID homepage</a> and include publishers, funders, universities, organizations and software companies. A number of important stakeholders are already part of the initiative, support by more funders (besides the Wellcome Trust) and software companies (particularly those that build reference managers or social networking sites for scientists) would be great. Probably the biggest name not on the list is the U.S. National Library of Medicine that runs the <em><em>PubMed</em></em> database of biomedical literature (the ORCID members Wellcome Trust and British Library are involved in UK PubMed Central).</p>
<h3 id="4-make-decisions-about-the-general-design-of-the-system">4. Make decisions about the general design of the system</h3>
<p>Some of the design decisions obviously are not set in stone at this stage. One continuing discussion is <em><em>centralized vs. federated</em></em>, and it looks like ORCID will be a centralized system similar to the DOI. Geoff Bilder has some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">good arguments</a> for a centralized system. Another recurring theme is <em><em>how much control an individual researcher has</em></em> over his ORCID record. Although external assertion from publishers or funders will certainly be part of ORCID, the individual researcher will have an important role, not only because of privacy concerns, but also because this is the easiest way to fix errors that even the best automated algorithms for author assignment will produce. And it looks as if ORCID will be an extensible system that will for example allow publishers or social networking sites to add functionality they require. The discussion at the STM Innovations meeting in early December touches some of these issues and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://river-valley.tv/how-researcherid-will-resolve-name-ambiguity-in-the-scholarly-ecosystem/">recorded as video</a> (after the talk by David Kochalko).</p>
<h3 id="5-pick-a-name">5. Pick a name</h3>
<p>The name <em><em>Open Researcher and Contributor ID</em></em> (ORCID) is obviously a combination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</a> (Thomson Reuters) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Bilder_CrossRef_Contributor_ID.pdf">Contributor ID</a> (CrossRef). I would have preferred a simpler name, but I guess we have to get used to ORCID.</p>
<h3 id="6-build-on-available-tools">6. Build on available tools</h3>
<p>ORCID will be based on the ResearcherID software from Thomson Reuters. From what I’ve seen, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">Open ID</a> system will not be a central part of ORCID. But ORCID certainly will be designed to work together with Open ID and other authentication mechanisms. I don’t know what Elsevier and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Weertman_Taking_the_guesswork_out_of_author_searching.pdf">Scopus Author ID</a> will contribute to ORCID.</p>
<h3 id="7-form-an-independent-organization">7. Form an independent organization</h3>
<p>In order to be adopted widely, ORCID must be run by an independent organization, and not by a single publisher, software company, research organization or funder. With the experience of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">running the DOI system</a> to identify digital objects such as scientific papers, CrossRef would be one obvious candidate, but the ORCID founding members have yet to decide on that.</p>
<h3 id="8-secure-financing">8. Secure financing</h3>
<p>Starting and maintaining ORCID will obviously cost money. In my little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/04/26/a-few-questions-about-author-identifiers-the-answers">survey about author identifiers back in April 2009</a>, the opinions were split about who should pay for this. Journal publishers and database maintainers (referring to such databases as PubMed, Scopus or Web of Science) were the two most common answers. ORCID will make it easier for funding agencies to evaluate scientists and they might therefore also contribute to the system. Individual researchers hopefully will not have to pay for any of this, but their input in time is obviously required.</p>
<h3 id="9-promote-orcid">9. Promote ORCID</h3>
<p>A <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">editorial</a> in December was a good start to promote ORCID to a wider audience. A unique identifier for scientists will only become accepted if widely used. That’s why it is important that publishers and funders quickly adopt this service. Software companies that build interesting tools around ORCID are also critical, e.g. integration of ORCID into manuscript submission systems (including the use of ORCID for the peer reviewers) and social networking sites (including of course Nature Network). My experience with the DOI for papers (e.g. the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/11/thoughts-on-the-pubmed-redesign">limited support in PubMed</a>) tells me that adoption of ORCID will be a long process.</p>
<h3 id="10-involve-individual-researchers">10. Involve individual researchers</h3>
<p>Individual researchers currently have no way to get directly involved in ORCID. But some level of involvement is critical for an author identifier to work. The best place is currently probably the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1807278">LinkedIn Group</a> Unique Identifiers for Researchers started by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile">Cameron Neylon</a>. But I hope we soon see ORCID discussions on Nature Network and other social networking sitess. The best place on Nature Network to discuss ORCID is currently probably the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/groups/socialnotworking/forum/topics">Scientific Researchers and Web 2.0: Social Not Working?</a> Forum.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sustainability in science is nothing new. The term sustainability science was probably first used in 2001 (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_science">Wikipedia entry</a>), and the title of this blog post was already used by a 2002 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.297.5583.897">editorial</a> in <em><em>Science</em></em>. There are both journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://ejournal.nbii.org/">Sustainability: Science, Practice &amp; Policy</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.springerlink.com/content/120154/">Sustainability Science</a>) and conferences (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.nzsses.auckland.ac.nz/conference/index.htm">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.vie.unu.edu/article/963">here</a>) about this topic and you can get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://sustsci.aaas.org/files/University%20Survey%20V2.pdf">degree</a> in sustainability science. The term sustainability is usually used in the context of climate change and the conservation of natural resources.</p>
<p>Here I want to use sustainability in a broader sense, using the original definition: <em><em>able to be maintained at a certain rate or level</em></em>.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/27/science_and_sustainability/#fn1">1</a></sup> Examples where the way we currently do science will probably no longer be sustainable in the future include grant applications that have a chance of success as low as 1% (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.nature.com/peer-to-peer/2009/08/the_wait_continues_for_nih_cha.html">the wait continues for NIH Challenge Grant applicants</a>), the ever-increasing costs for access to scholarly publications (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.sennoma.net/main/archives/2009/06/what_happened_to_serials_price.php">serials crisis</a>), or the exponential growth of drug development costs without any increase in approval for new drugs in the last 60 years (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2009/12/09/drug_companies_since_1950.php">Drug Companies Since 1950</a>).</p>
<p>Sustainability in science requires the individual researcher to think about his responsibility, i.e. to go beyond research that is personally interesting and is paid for by someone. I do think that increasing sustainability in science is a worthy goal, and I picked six examples.</p>
<h3 id="make-access-to-research-results-affordable">Make access to research results affordable</h3>
<p>For those not working at an academic institution, many subscription-based journals now make their papers available after a 6-12 month embargo period. Immediate full access to an individual paper in these journals can cost anywhere between $10 and $30 ($31.50 Cell, $15.00 Science, $32.00 Nature, $31.50 The Lancet, $10 New England Journal of Medicine). As you can guess from the wide range for these journals alone, these prizes are probably not calculated to cover actual costs. Deep Dyve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blog.deepdyve.com/2009/11/03/a-new-market-opportunity/">launched a rental service for scientific content</a> in October. They charge $0.99 per article rental, but currently include only a limited number of journals.</p>
<p>Most researchers have access to subscription-based journals through their institutions. My university library currently has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.3205/mbi000161">budget</a> of about 900,000 € per year for just over 2000 researchers and 2600 students. Even with this money, our institution <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">can't afford subscriptions to all journals</a> import for my work. And subscription costs are increasing much faster than library budgets. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/12/13/on-giving-a-talk-about-open-access-in-my-department">Open Access</a> obviously is one answer to this dilemma, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2497">may not work for all journals</a>. Most of us would probably be happy to pay for journal subscriptions if subscription costs simply remained reasonable. Because a handful of publishers own a large part of scientific journals, this will only happen if someone representing a large group of universities and research institutions sits at the negotiation table.</p>
<h3 id="reduce-the-bureaucracy-in-science-funding">Reduce the bureaucracy in science funding</h3>
<p>We are currently spending too much time trying to obtain research funding compared to the time actually doing research. This is in part because the chances of obtaining a grant are often fairly low and grant applications have to be submitted many times, and because the duration of some grants is to short, e.g. only 2-3 years (sometimes meaning you have to start writing on the extension grant after the first year). Providing funding to excellent researchers for longer periods of time instead of funding projects is one approach to improve this situation. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has done this for many years with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/">HHMI investigators</a> and the Wellcome Trust last month announced a similar approach with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2009/WTX057403.htm">Wellcome Trust Investigator Awards</a>.</p>
<h3 id="communicate-and-use-research-results">Communicate and use research results</h3>
<p>A lot of research has practical value, but this practical value has to be explored. One nice example from my area of expertise is an international consortium to improve the outcome of a specific form of acute leukemia in the developing world. The first results <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.hematology.org/Publications/ASH-News-Daily/2009/4636.aspx">were reported</a> at the ASH meeting earlier this month, one of only a handful of abstracts to be picked for the plenary session. But use of research results goes beyond translational research, using them for science education (both in schools and universities) is equally important.</p>
<p>Science blogging could have an important role in communicating research, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2009/12/story-behind-nature-paper-on-phylogeny.html">this blog post</a> from a few days ago is a wonderful example of how a blog post can enhance a <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08656">paper</a>. It would be great if more journals would follow the <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals in linking to blogs posts about a paper,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/27/science_and_sustainability/#fn2">2</a></sup> and journals should help their authors to blog, e.g. by asking for a blog post (that could be hosted by the journal) on paper acceptance. Conference blogging is another area where science blogging would be a very welcome addition. It was nice to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/09/17/german-genetics-society-meeting-2009-introduction">official conference blogging</a> at the German Genetics Conference this year, and I hope to see more of that.</p>
<h3 id="develop-and-promote-technologies-that-make-scholarly-research-more-efficient">Develop and promote technologies that make scholarly research more efficient</h3>
<p>Obviously I have written a lot about this topic on this blog, e.g. about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like">article of the future</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/01/bibliographic-management-meets-web-2-0">reference management</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/25/editorial-manager-interview-with-richard-wynne">paper submission</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/05/01/extyles-interview-with-elizabeth-blake-and-bruce-rosenblum">validation, formatting and exporting of scholarly content</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">researcher identifiers</a>. But I believe that there is still a lot more that can be done, and I expect to see one or more disruptive technologies in the future. Time will tell if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/18/using-google-wave-for-a-week-its-still-great">Google Wave</a> is one of them, the Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a>) announced earlier this month certainly is a very big step forward.</p>
<h3 id="preserve-research-data">Preserve research data</h3>
<p>Providing and preserving the research data behind a project is becoming increasingly important, and simply writing up a paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.cotch.net/blog/20091223_1558">is no longer enough</a>.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/27/science_and_sustainability/#fn3">3</a></sup> In many areas we lack the infrastructure (nomenclature, databases, etc.) and resources for this, especially for long-term preservation. One ambitious project is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.elixir-europe.org/page.php">Elixir</a>, which is trying to develop an infrastructure for biological information in Europe. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/">CaBIG</a> project at the U.S. National Cancer Institute is trying to do something similar for cancer research. Examples for digital preservation projects can be found at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/ccare/introduction/digital/">British Library</a> and the German <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.langzeitarchivierung.de/eng/index.htm">Nestor</a> project.</p>
<h3 id="involve-people-outside-of-universities-and-institutions-in-research">Involve people outside of universities and institutions in research</h3>
<p>Many areas of research would profit from this approach. A prominent example of citizen science is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a>, where more than 150,000 people are helping with the classification of astronomy images. Involving people is especially in medical research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.pdonlineresearch.org/">PD Online Research</a> is a wonderful community site about research on Parkinson disease that launched in June 2009. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://scienceroll.com/personalized-medicine/">Personalized genetics</a> can give the patient or healthy individual a more active role in healthcare decisions.</p>
<p>Whether sustainability will ultimately play a greater role in science will ultimately depend on those paying for research. If universities, institutions and funders continue to look mainly at goals that are both too short-term and only an indirect measure of scientific progress (e.g. the Impact Factor of a journal that a paper is published in), and don't honor activities such as data annotation, public outreach, etc., this will be very difficult. I wish you a great start into the new year.</p>
<p>The German word for sustainability is <em><em>Nachhaltigkeit</em></em>.</p>

<p>Two papers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174153/http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2009.427">this</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174153/http://http//dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2009.440">this</a>) and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174153/http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2009.453">editorial</a> in the latest issue of <em><em>Archives of Internal Medicine</em></em> examine the cancer risks associated with the use of computed tomography (CT) examinations.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/20/increased_cancer_risk_following_computed_tomography_scans/#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Ionizing radiation increases the risk for developing cancer. There is direct evidence from atomic bomb survivors in Japan in 1945 and from nuclear accidents such as the one in Chernobyl in 1986. There are no studies directly demonstrating an increased cancer risk from the diagnostic use of X-rays (either conventional radiographs or computed tomography), as this would require long-term follow-up of a very large number of people. This risk can only be estimated, based on the assumption that there is no lower radiation threshold dose for cancer risk and that a linear correlation exists between dose and cancer risk. Similarly, we know very little about the actual radiation doses that patients receive during a diagnostic CT scan.</p>
<p>The paper by <strong><strong>Rebecca Smith-Bindman</strong></strong> and her coworkers looked at the radiation doses associated with the 11 most common computed tomography examinations in four hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Radiation doses to individual patients were not measured directly, but were estimated using the commonly used “effective dose”. Median effective doses for routine computed tomography of the head, chest and abdomen-pelvis were 2, 8 and 16 mSv. The highest median effective doses (31 mSv) were used for multiphase CTs of the abdomen-pelvis (range 6-90 mSv). The 8 mSv dose for a routine chest CT is equivalent to 119 conventional chest X-rays. Interestingly, there was wide variation of effective doses used both between hospitals and within the same institution (with a mean 13-fold variation between highest and lowest dose for each CT study type).</p>
<p>Based on these doses, the authors then estimated the increased risk for radiation-induced cancer following a CT examination. This risk is higher in younger people and in women. Women have a higher risk to develop lung cancer following radiation exposure and they have the added risk of developing breast cancer. The authors estimated that it would for example require approximately 620 CT scans for ruling out pulmonary embolism in 40-year-old women to induce one cancer.</p>
<p>The second paper by <strong><strong>Amy Berrington de Gonzalez</strong></strong> and coworkers tried to calculate the total number of CT scans performed in the US in 2007, and estimated the increased risk for cancer related to these CT scans based on examination type, age and sex. They used a similar model to calculate the cancer risk as the first paper. Overall, about 72 million CT scans were performed in the US in 2007. The authors estimated that approximately 29.000 additional cancers will eventually develop, equivalent to approximately 2% of all cancers diagnosed annually in the US.</p>
<p>CT scans have dramatically improved patient care, and the conclusions of these two papers should not preclude their use in patients where the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks mentioned above. But in order to reduce the cancer risk associated with CT scans, the authors of the two papers and the editorial suggest to optimize and standardize the CT scan procedure (remember the 13-fold difference in dose for the same procedure) and to decrease the number of unnecessary examinations. The latter is most relevant when CT scans are performed as screening procedures.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month I gave this talk in my department. It is basically a summary of two blog posts that I wrote in October during <strong><strong>Open Access Week</strong></strong> (Open Access Week: a researcher's perspective <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">part I</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/23/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective-part-ii">part II</a>), and I had given a similar talk in November in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=254">Open Access workshop</a> organized by the Helmholtz Association. But because this time my audience (researchers and clinicians in a university hospital) was less knowledgeable about Open Access, I added a few introductory slides in the beginning.</p>
<p>The discussion is usually the most interesting part, and this topic certainly has a lot of material for discussion. Interestingly, we talked mainly about the problem of <strong><strong>copyright</strong></strong>. Even though anybody who has ever submitted a paper to a (non-Open Access) journal has signed a copyright transfer agreement, the implications of this were not really clear to most people in the audience. Reuse of a figure or table in an academic seminar usually falls under <strong><strong>fair use</strong></strong>, but many journals still require a (free) permission.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/13/on_giving_a_talk_about_open_access_in_my_department/#fn1">1</a></sup> And using the same figure in a medical conference can cost several hundred dollars, and it doesn't really matter that you are one of the authors of the paper (slides 15-17 in the presentation). Some of my colleagues have run into issues with copyright, usually when the talks of a conference were later redistributed on a CD or website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there wasn't enough time to discuss some of the other issues raised in the talk, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why can't our Medical School Library afford an institutional subscription for <em><em>Cell</em></em>?</li>
<li>Why is there no <strong><strong>institutional repository</strong></strong> at our university?</li>
<li>Why is it very unlikely that we will have a mandate for Open Access in Germany in the near future?</li>
<li>Why has the <strong><strong>Impact Factor</strong></strong> become so important in Medicine?</li>
</ul>
<p>The seminar was also interesting in that this was one of the rare occasions where I talked publicly in my department about some of the topics that I regularly write about on this blog. I always felt that most of my colleagues don't really care about these topics, and that they probably think I should rather spend my time working on the next paper or grant. I haven't gotten much feedback after the talk, but maybe I should reconsider that position.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Many journals use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://www.copyright.com/">Copyright.com</a>, which makes this process straightforward.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/about_journal.html">Nature Communications</a> is a new journal that will launch in Spring 2010. The journal will publish papers in all areas of the physical, chemical and biological sciences and is open for submissions.</p>
<p>The Nature Publishing Group publishes one fully open access journal (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/msb/index.html">Molecular Systems Biology</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/greengold.html">more than ten journals</a> that offer an open access option for authors (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/emboj/index.html">EMBO Journal</a>). <em>Nature Communications</em> will be the first Nature journal with an open access option for authors. <em>Nature Communications</em> papers where the author has not opted for open access will be available through an institutional subscription, or by purchasing an individual article.</p>
<p>There are many good arguments for open access, but from a journal perspective the publishing model must make business sense. Most open access journals use the author-pays model, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2497">an editorial in the August 2009 issue</a> of Nature Materials talked about some of the difficulties of this publishing model for the Nature journals – the costs that are currently spread among many subscribers would be prohibitely high for an author-pays option. Some high-profile open access journals have article publication charges that are probably not covering all costs (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.plosbiology.org/home.action">PLoS Biology</a>) or use a different business model that doesn't require article publication charges (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.bmj.com/">BMJ</a>). <em>Nature Communications</em> will have an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/open_access/index.html">article publication charge of $5000</a>, which is higher than what most journals charge. I interviewed Lesley Anson, the Chief Editor of <em>Nature Communications</em>, to learn more about the journal.</p>
<h3 id="1-can-you-describe-nature-communications-for-me">1. Can you describe Nature Communications for me?</h3>
<p><em>Nature Communications</em> is the latest journal in NPG's portfolio. It is an online-only multidisciplinary journal publishing original research papers in all areas of the biological, chemical and physical sciences. The published research will be of the quality associated with Nature-branded journals, but won't necessarily have the high impact or broad appeal of papers published in Nature and the Nature research journals. In other words, we expect that papers published in <em>Nature Communications</em> will be of interest and importance to specialists within each field.</p>
<p>All research papers will be in Article format, regardless of their length, and will undergo rigorous, yet efficient, peer review and be published rapidly online. Authors of primary research papers can choose to make their published article available via subscribed access, or open access through the payment of a publication fee. <em>Nature Communications</em> will also publish occasional Reviews and Editorials.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-will-you-be-doing-differently-from-other-nature-journals">2. What will you be doing differently from other Nature journals?</h3>
<p>There are a number of differences between <em>Nature Communications</em> and other Nature-branded journals. For example, all other Nature titles publish print issues with regular news and comment sections and are available only by subscribed access.</p>
<p>Like other Nature-branded journals, <em>Nature Communications</em> has an independent team of editors who are responsible for maintaining the quality of the published research through rigorous peer review. However, <em>Nature Communications</em> has streamlined the editorial process – by limiting presubmission enquiries, appeals and the number of rounds of review – in order to secure rapid decisions for authors. The journal has also undertaken to publish research papers within 28 days of acceptance.</p>
<p>Another distinctive feature of <em>Nature Communications</em> is its Editorial Advisory Panel – to be announced shortly – which will consist of recognized experts from all areas of science. Their collective expertise will support the editorial team in ensuring that every field is represented in the journal.</p>
<h3 id="3-is-nature-communications-still-a-journal-in-the-traditional-sense-the-journal-is-online-only-has-no-news-and-views-and-the-articles-will-be-so-specialized-that-most-people-will-probably-find-papers-by-a-database-search-rather-than-by-looking-at-the-table-of-contents-">3. Is Nature Communications still a journal in the traditional sense? The journal is online only, has no news and views, and the articles will be so specialized that most people will probably find papers by a database search rather than by looking at the table of contents.</h3>
<p>I suppose it depends on your definition of a traditional journal. One could argue that we are going back to the roots of learned journals by focussing predominantly on primary research. In addition, like the traditional Nature-branded journals, <em>Nature Communications</em> has a defined scope and publishes only high-quality research.</p>
<p>We appreciate, though, that readers are accustomed to browsing journals by issue, therefore we are implementing technology to make the online browsing experience both intuitive and effective. There will be a number of ways for authors to find papers of interest to them, including personalization options and an extensive browse by subject category.</p>
<h3 id="4-why-did-you-decide-to-have-a-hybrid-model-of-both-open-access-and-subscribed-access">4. Why did you decide to have a hybrid model of both open access and subscribed access?</h3>
<p>We consider ourselves fortunate in being able to offer authors the choice of publishing with open access as well as subscribed access. Increasing support by funders for open access publication has made hybrid business models more viable for publishers. Furthermore, <em>Nature Communications</em> focus on primary research is particularly suited to a hybrid model because the cost of commissioning, editing and producing secondary content is minimized. These factors, and the high rejection rates on Nature and the Nature research journals, make open access charges for any other Nature-branded journal prohibitively high in the current market.</p>
<h3 id="5-with-this-hybrid-model-in-place-it-will-be-interesting-to-closely-watch-how-open-access-and-subscribed-access-articles-are-accessed-over-time-">5. With this hybrid model in place, it will be interesting to closely watch how open access and subscribed access articles are accessed over time.</h3>
<p>Yes, it will be interesting to monitor the average view rates for open-access versus subscribed access papers and we will be doing this following launch.</p>
<h3 id="6-does-an-author-decide-about-open-vs-subscribed-access-before-or-after-a-paper-is-accepted-for-publication">6. Does an author decide about open vs. subscribed access before or after a paper is accepted for publication?</h3>
<p>Authors won't have to make a final decision about access to their paper until the point at which their paper is accepted. Where authors do indicate a preference one way or the other during the editorial process, the reviewers will be blind to that choice.</p>
<h3 id="7-what-percentage-of-articles-do-you-expect-to-be-open-access">7. What percentage of articles do you expect to be open access?</h3>
<p>We can't predict what the open-access take-up will be like, and we are therefore prepared for open access uptake varying from as little as 0% to as much as 100%. <em>Nature Communications</em> business model works at both extremes and all values in between.</p>
<h3 id="8-how-does-the-transfer-of-a-manuscript-rejected-at-another-nature-journal-work">8. How does the transfer of a manuscript rejected at another Nature Journal work?</h3>
<p>The process of transferring a manuscript to <em>Nature Communications</em> is exactly the same as the transfer mechanism between the existing Nature-branded journals. Control rests entirely with the author, so transfers are only made at the authors request and with the understanding that the reviewers' reports from the previous journal will be transferred to <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>Importantly, because all Nature journals are editorially independent, authors rejected from another Nature journal can choose to submit their paper to <em>Nature Communications</em> as a new submission. In that case, any submission or peer review details will remain confidential to the journal from which the manuscript was rejected.</p>
<h3 id="9-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-nature-communications">9. What are your responsibilities at Nature Communications?</h3>
<p>I am the Chief Editor of <em>Nature Communications</em> , which means I am responsible for the editorial content of the journal. I have a team of talented editors to help in the task of selecting suitable manuscripts for publication: a biologist, a physicist and a chemist. Their profiles are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/authors/about_eds/index.html">available on our website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="10-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-at-nature-communications">10. What did you do before starting to work at Nature Communications?</h3>
<p>Before taking on the task of launching Nature Communications, I spent more than ten years as a manuscript editor at Nature. During that time, I handled a number of different areas in the cellular and molecular sciences, and was also responsible for the editorial content of Nature's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507030644/http://www.nature.com/nature/supplements/insights/index.html">Insight Programme</a>. Before joining Nature I trained as a biophysicist at the University of Bristol and University College London.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week the <em><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></em> (<em><em>NEJM</em></em>) published a paper on selective outcome reporting in clinical trials (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa0906126">Vedula et al. 2009</a>). The primary and secondary outcome(s) of a clinical trial could for example be survival in cancer patients or rate of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events in patients taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. These outcomes are defined in the study protocol before the first patient is treated, and whether or not the primary outcome is reached (using statistical testing) defines whether a trial was positive or negative. The study protocol is approved by an institutional review board (IRB) and can only be changed later (and that includes changes in the protocol-defined outcomes) if again approved by the IRB.</p>
<p>The study in the <em><em>NEJM</em></em> examined the outcomes of 20 clinical trials for the drug gabapentin using internal documents of the drug companies Pfizer and Parke-Davis, and compared them to the outcomes reported for those trials that were published as peer-reviewed papers. The internal company documents were obtained as the result of litigation in which the company admitted guilt for off-label marketing (i.e. marketing for uses that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration) of gabapentin.</p>
<p>12 of the 20 trials were published as peer-reviewed papers. In 8 of these 12 papers the primary outcome differed from the primary outcome defined in the protocol. New primary outcomes were introduced in 6 papers, and protocol-defined primary outcomes were not reported in 5 papers. Trials with primary outcomes that were not significant were either not reported as full paper or were reported with a changed primary outcome.</p>
<p>Selective outcome reporting has also been reported by other authors and is not limited to trials funded by drug companies (Chan 2004). Selective outcome reporting is a major problem because it a) distorts our scientific knowledge and b) is unethical as it involves research on human subjects. This could for example lead to repeated studies of a clearly ineffective or harmful drug or intervention. The distortion of our scientific knowledge by selective outcome reporting in scientific journals is also a concern for research in other areas. Confirmation of important research findings by independent groups is important, but a lot of research is probably repeated simply because negative results were not published. Some of these reporting biases could be avoided by making more unpublished research data available, either by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/">Open Notebook Science</a> or by publishing “unexciting negative” findings in peer-review journals or preprint archives such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>.</p>
<p>Clinical medicine tries to solve the problem of publication bias by making public registration of clinical trials mandatory before patient enrollment. This registration is required by most major medical journals since 2004 (De Angelis 2004). U.S. legislation also requires clinical trial registration and since 2008 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/08/02/fdaaa-push-to-open-data-in-clinical-medicine">FDAAA: Push to open data in clinical medicine</a>) this includes outcome reporting within 12 months after data for the last subject were received in the publicly available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a> database. These efforts should ensure ethical standards of clinical research, and help to avoid the kinds of biases reported in the paper by Vedula et al.</p>
<p>Clinical trial registries obviously also serve other purposes, as they help interested patients and their relatives and treating physicians to find clinical trials they want to participate in, and they help researchers and clinicians to do a systematic overview of the ongoing research in a particular field. Just as there are centralized databases (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/">Current Controlled Trials</a> metaRegister of controlled trials) and institutional repositories for full-text papers, there are also both central (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a> – Both PubMed Central and Clinicaltrials.gov are efforts by the U.S. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>) and institutional clinical trial registries. But in contrast to institutional repositories, there are no standard software tools available that an institution can use. I am involved in building a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien">clinical trial registry for our institution</a>, and the effort is both technically demanding, and socially challenging. The information in a clinical trial registry is constantly changing and we need to keep the efforts required by the individual researchers at a mininum. We also have to walk a fine line of what information can be made publicly available, and here we follow the standards provided by both Clinicaltrials.gov and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">WHO</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003094331/https://eudract.emea.europa.eu/">EudraCT</a>, the mandatory European clinical trials registry is regretably not available to the public.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In September <em><em>PLoS</em></em> started to show usage data (downloads, citations, but also use of social bookmarking services and blog posts) for all their published papers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.plos.org/cms/node/485">article-level metrics at PLoS: addition of usage data</a>). <em><em>PLoS</em></em> is not the first publisher to do that, but certainly the largest to date. Two Nature Network bloggers wrote about these changes back in June (The Scientist: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/06/22/on-article-level-metrics-and-other-animals">On article-level metrics and other animals</a>) and August (Gobbledygook: <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">PLoS One: Interview with Peter Binfield</a>), and a number of blogs commented on this new feature, including:</p>

</ul>
<p>There are a number of reasons why article-level metrics are a good idea, and I hope that many other journal publishers will follow. But in this blog post I want to talk about some of the shortcomings of the current implementation of article-level metrics.</p>
<h3 id="article-level-metrics-should-be-combined-from-different-places">Article-level metrics should be combined from different places</h3>
<p>Full-text articles live in more than one place. Obviously at the journal publisher's website, but in many cases also in one or more institutional repositories and at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> (or similar places for papers not published in the life sciences). Which of these places produces the most reliable article-level metrics or should the HTML views, PDF downloads, etc. from all these places be combined? The decentralized nature of institutional repositories makes it especially difficult to combine usage statistics from them, but there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english/">projects</a> that try to tackle this problem. A unique identifier is required to combine the usage data from these different sources, and we have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> for that. <em><em>PubMed Central</em></em> and similar large repositories could not only start to provide their own usage data, but also combine them with the usage data from those journal publishers that already provide them.</p>
<h3 id="article-level-metrics-need-author-identifiers">Article-level metrics need author identifiers</h3>
<p>Evaluating the “impact” of a researcher is one obvious use for article-level metrics. In order to be able to do that for more than a handful of researchers, we need unique author identifiers. This year we have had many discussions about author identifiers (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">this blog</a> and at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/23/thoughts-on-the-science-online-london-conference">Science Online London Conference</a>), and I hope that in 2010 we will finally see an evolving standard that is picked up by journal publishers. It would be in the interest of PLoS to combine their article-level metrics with an author identifier as soon as possible, most likely the proposed CrossRef ContributorID, rather than the Elsevier Scopus Author Identifier or the Thomson Reuters Researcher ID.</p>
<h3 id="article-level-metrics-should-enhance-literature-searches">Article-level metrics should enhance literature searches</h3>
<p>We all know how Google became the most popular search engine (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Pagerank</a>). And article usage data would be a tremendous boost for scientific literature databases such as PubMed. A literature search should sort the results by usage data (e.g. a combination of number of citations, HTML views and PDF downloads) rand not the rather boring publication date, author or journal name. Normally I would think that <em><em>Google Scholar</em></em> would be the first place to implement such a functionality, but I haven't seen much innovation from Google Scholar lately.</p>
<h3 id="article-level-metrics-should-not-only-be-numbers">Article-level metrics should not only be numbers</h3>
<p>As we don't want to reduce a paper to simple numbers, it is important to provide more than HTML views and PDF download counts. Citations counts are useful numbers, but linking to the citing papers is even more interesting. Similarly we want to see links to <em><em>Faculty of 1000</em></em> recommendations and blog posts aggregated at <em><em>ResearchBlogging.org</em></em>. If we extend this further, we should probably start to think about a better name for article-level metrics. And I hope we never start to call this ALM.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> was launched in February 2000 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a free digital archive of journal articles. Just as PubMed, PubMed Central covers research in the life sciences, but not other areas of research, e.g. engineering, physical sciences or astronomy.</p>
<p>Some journal articles are available as full text as soon as they are published, and most journals provide free access to full text articles within a year of publication. Some journals only provide the full text of some articles, including research funded by the NIH under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">NIH Public Access Policy</a>. The majority of fulltext articles in PubMed Central are not Open Access, but are protected by copyright. These articles are often made available under a license that allows redistribution and reuse.</p>
<p>All articles are deposited using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM-DTD</a> XML format, which is a standard text format suitable for text mining and long-term archiving. Most articles are deposited directly by the journals, so that authors do not have to get involved in the technical aspects of article deposition.</p>
<p>PubMed Central is a centralized archive of full text papers and not simply an interface to search these articles at the websites of the participating journals. Neither is PubMed Central an interface to search the various institutional repositories at universities and institutions. The NIH thinks that this centralized approach makes it easier to develop additional functionality, including the integration with other databases (e.g. the protein or nucleotide databases) hosted at the NIH.</p>
<p>UK PubMed Central was launched in 2007 as the first PubMed Central outside the United States (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/">PubMed Central Canada</a>, the second international PubMed Central, launched this week). In January 2010 UK PubMed Central will launch a number of new services, and I used the opportunity to ask UK PubMed Central Programme Manager Philip Vaughan a few questions.</p>

<h3 id="1-what-is-uk-pubmed-central">1. What is UK PubMed Central?</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK PubMed Central</a> offers free access to 1.6 million full text journal articles in the fields of Life Sciences, Biomedicine and Health. Our content is free to read, print off and download. There is no registration process required: users can simply visit our site and start searching!It has been developed in consultation with the UK biomedical and health research community, and is about to launch some exciting new services in January 2010. Usage of our service has been growing steadily; we average 300,000 downloads a month currently.</p>
<h3 id="2-why-do-we-need-more-than-one-pubmed-central-and-how-are-they-connected">2. Why do we need more than one PubMed Central, and how are they connected</h3>
<p>UKPMC gives the UK research community access to all the content of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PMC</a>, but with added value specifically for the UK. For example, it offers Grant Reporting features, whereby users can search for current grants from all of our 8 Funders, can link the publications they produce to the grants they originated from, and view the impact of their work through access to citations. UK researchers can also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/https://ukmss.mimas.ac.uk/ukmss">deposit their manuscripts directly</a> into UKPMC.We will also be accessing additional content not in PMC; around 475,000 extra articles, reviews, guidelines and theses. Through the involvement of our funders, we are capturing around 90% of recently published journal articles from biomedical research conducted in the UK.We are therefore increasing the visibility of UK research in the field.</p>
<p>Our colleagues at NCBI in the US have been very supportive of our activities: they have been keen for the PMC “project” to expand beyond the US. A Canadian version (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/">PMC Canada</a>) launched this week.</p>
<h3 id="3-why-does-a-search-use-pubmed-central-and-not-the-uk-version">3. Why does a search use PubMed Central and not the UK version?</h3>
<p>The current UKPMC site searches PMC as it “mirrors” its content. But this about to change; from January UKPMC will be a “stand alone” service with its own up to date archive of content, as well as access to all the content of PubMed and PubMed Central.</p>
<h3 id="4-what-is-the-relationship-between-uk-pubmed-central-and-institutional-repositories">4. What is the relationship between UK PubMed Central and institutional repositories?</h3>
<p>UKPMC is a subject repository and as such receives content from researchers at Higher Education institutions across the UK. Deposition in UKPMC is mandatory if a researcher has a grant from any of our 8 Funders: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/">Cancer Research UK</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.mrc.ac.uk/">Medical Research Council</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.bhf.org.uk/">British Heart Foundation</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.arc.org.uk/">Arthritis Research Campaign</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/">Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.nihr.ac.uk/">National Institute for Health Research</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/cso/">Chief Scientists Office</a>. Consequently we do not need to harvest content from other repositories. However, institutional repositories are welcome to harvest our content; we have an OAI-PMH interface to enable this. On the other hand, there are no plans to develop of institutional repositories from within UK PubMed Central.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-is-the-material-that-can-t-be-put-into-uk-pubmed-central">5. What is the material that can't be put into UK PubMed Central?</h3>
<p>If the material is not peer-reviewed research published in a recognized journal by a known publisher, it would not be deposited into UK PubMed Central. One aspect of our development programme has been to identify what further content we could provide links to, for example published research theses and NHS clinical guidelines. But, we have rigid quality control procedures in place even to provide links to material. That said, we do remain open minded, in terms of what material we may consider linking to in the future. And who knows what might arise in the future. For example, there does seem to be an appetite to include images.</p>
<h3 id="6-can-i-submit-my-accepted-manuscript-if-it-was-not-funded-by-one-of-the-uk-pubmed-central-funders">6. Can I submit my accepted manuscript if it was not funded by one of the UK PubMed Central funders?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately not at this time. We are hopeful that other UK research councils and funders of life sciences research will come on board in due course. The more funders that come on board, the stronger our service will become and the stronger our message on the importance of OA.</p>
<h3 id="7-what-is-the-uk-pubmed-central-oai-service">7. What is the UK PubMed Central OAI service?</h3>
<p>The UK PubMed Central OAI service, (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/ppmc-localhtml/oai_service.html">UKPMC-OAI</a>) provides access to metadata of all items in the UKPMC archive, as well as to the full text of a subset of these items.</p>
<h3 id="8-what-are-your-responsibilities-at-uk-pubmed-central">8. What are your responsibilities at UK PubMed Central?</h3>
<p>I am the Programme Manager. I am responsible for the current service which has been in existence since January 2007. I also co-ordinate all our current development activities, which are undertaken by ourselves at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a>, by the University of Manchester (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://mimas.ac.uk/">MIMAS</a>), the National Centre for Text Mining (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.nactem.ac.uk/">NacTEM</a> – based at the University of Manchester) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a>) based at Hinxton in Cambridgeshire.</p>
<h3 id="9-what-did-you-do-before-starting-to-work-on-uk-pubmed-central">9. What did you do before starting to work on UK PubMed Central?</h3>
<p>I originally trained as a librarian. Since then I have worked mainly in health and medical information work, both in Higher Education and in the National Health Service. My most recent post was for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a> (Joint Information Systems Committee) as a Programme Manager. I was responsible for a portfolio of development projects in the digital library sphere. I joined UKPMC at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a> in May 2008.</p>
<h3 id="10-do-you-want-to-talk-about-future-plans-for-uk-pubmed-central">10. Do you want to talk about future plans for UK PubMed Central?</h3>
<p>Yes please! We are soon to launch some exciting new initiatives in January 2010. Our website has been completely redesigned with a new more intuitive interface, and we will be expanding our content to include all content from PubMed (c. 18m references), patents, theses and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.library.nhs.uk/GUIDELINESFINDER/">NHS Clinical Guidelines</a>. Consequently our users will be able to access a vast collection of relevant content through one portal.</p>
<p>Our search engine will be utilising innovative new techniques such as text mining to retrieve more contextually relevant information, link to other relevant databases and provide a richer search experience for the user. We are also expanding our Grant Reporting functions to allow Grantees and Funders to assess the impact and value of their funded research, and increase their visibility.</p>
<p>Our Funders are keen to expand the programme, possibly towards a future <em><em>European PubMed Central</em></em>.We are hopeful that as part of this process some European Funders may be joining the programme shortly. Our Funders hope to make an announcement regarding this shortly.</p>
<p>We are holding a Showcase event on January 12th at the British Library in London to highlight these new developments and the future potential of the service.</p>
<h3 id="11-could-you-provide-contact-information-for-people-that-have-further-questions-about-pubmed-central">11. Could you provide contact information for people that have further questions about PubMed Central?</h3>
<p>By all means, people can email us at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/mailto:ukpmc%40bl.uk">ukpmc@bl.uk</a> and my email is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://bl.uk/">Philip.Vaughan@bl.uk</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week (October 19-23) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a> – a good opportunity to think and write about this topic. On Monday I wrote in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Open Access can be looked at from many different angles, including the researcher, the science library, the institution, the funding organization, the journal, the science journalist, and the general public. Most arguments for or against Open Access depend on that angle. As a researcher, I am most interested in whether Open Access will make my work easier. Again, a researcher can look at Open Access from different roles: reader, author, reviewer, editor.
</blockquote>
<p>In that blog post I then wrote about the role of the researcher as a reader. Now I want to look at the perspective of the researcher as an author.</p>
<h3 id="choice-of-journal">Choice of journal</h3>
<p>The decision of where to publish a manuscript for most researchers probably works something like “find the best journal where I can publish my work with the least amount of trouble”. <em><em>Best journal</em></em> usually is a subjective decision, but probably correlates with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/free/essays/impact_factor/">Impact Factor</a> of a journal. As the average quality of manuscripts is higher in a <em><em>better journal</em></em>, this will help to value your research in the eyes of granting agencies and job search committees. <em><em>Better journal</em></em> often means higher rejection rates and/or higher numbers of readers. Both factors – and journals that publish a relatively small number of papers – favor a subscription business model<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="publication-cost">Publication cost</h3>
<p>Most Open Access journals use an author-pays model to pay for publication costs. Funding agencies or institutions may pick up these costs, but authors may be left with costs of $2500 or more.</p>
<h3 id="institutional-repositories">Institutional Repositories</h3>
<p>Self-archiving in institutional repositories (green access) is a great way to make your publication freely available if the paper is published in a journal that is not Open Access. Unfortunately this often requires extra efforts by the researcher, and the publication will be more difficult to find in the repository than in the journal. This creates little incentive for a researcher to get involved in self-archiving.</p>
<h3 id="citation-advantage">Citation advantage</h3>
<p>The effect of free access to the scientific literature on article downloads and citations is difficult to measure. Some<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn2">2</a></sup>, but not all studies<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn3">3</a></sup> show higher citation rates for articles that are freely available and this citation advantage might be modest<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/10/23/open_access_week_a_researchers_perspective_part_ii/#fn4">4</a></sup>. Citations are generated by other researchers who have access to your paper, and therefore I'm not surprised if there is not much of a difference between papers in Open Access journals and popular journals that are subscribed my many institutions.</p>
<h3 id="better-access">Better Access</h3>
<p>Researchers in poorer countries will have easier access to papers published in Open Access journals, although many subscription journals wave access fees through initiatives such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105548/http://www.who.int/hinari/en/">Hinari</a>. Open Access makes it easier for journalists, high school students, patient advocacy groups and many more people to read your papers. This is obviously of great value to these groups, but I haven't seen many examples where the paper author directly benefitted from this.</p>
<h3 id="social-responsibility">Social responsibility</h3>
<p>The argument that publicly funded research should be available to everybody at time of publication can be a motivation for many scientists, but I would be careful to turn this into an obligation. Different countries have different traditions, but in my home country Germany the independence of research and researchers (including the decision where to publish) has become a constitutional right after the atrocities committed in the name of “science” in Nazi Germany. All major German research organizations support Open Access, but in contrast to other countries there is no Open Access mandate.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Publishing in an Open Access journal has surprisingly little benefits for the author of a paper, and often means additional costs. Unless we want to mandate Open Access publishing from authors because it benefits the other stakeholders (which at least in Germany would be difficult), we should make publishing in an Open Access journal more attractive to authors. It looks like PLoS ONE is doing exactly that, as 400 manuscripts published per month testify.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week (October 19-23) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Open Access Week is an opportunity to broaden awareness and understanding of Open Access to research, including access policies from all types of research funders, within the international higher education community and the general public.
</blockquote>
<p>The following video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.arl.org/sparc/">SPARC</a> (the Scholarly Publishing &amp; Academic Resources Coalition) is a good introduction:</p>
<p>Open Access can be looked at from many different angles, including the <em><em>researcher</em></em>, the <em><em>science library</em></em>, the <em><em>institution</em></em>, the <em><em>funding organization</em></em>, the <em><em>journal</em></em>, the <em><em>science journalist</em></em>, and the <em><em>general public</em></em>. Most arguments for or against Open Access depend on that angle. As a researcher, I am most interested in whether Open Access will make my work easier. Again, a researcher can look at Open Access from different roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reader</li>
<li>Author</li>
<li>Reviewer</li>
<li>Editor</li>
</ul>
<p>The role as a reviewer or editor for an open access paper should be essentially the same as for a paper with subscription-based access. The journal <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> that launches in April 2010 with a hybrid publishing model of open access and subscription-based access will for example have reviewers and editors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/open_access/pdf/open-access-faqs.pdf">blinded to the author's choice</a>.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will look at Open Access from the perspective of the researcher as a reader.</p>
<h3 id="access">Access</h3>
<p>As a researcher in a German university I am privileged to have institutional access to most journal articles that I need for my work. I use the program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> as my main reference manager. Papers allows me to order my currently 1715 references (and PDFs of fulltext paper to most of them) by journal. Among the 20 journals with the most papers in my library, my institution doesn't have access to three of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>Cell</em></em> (don't ask)</li>
<li><em><em>Lancet Oncology</em></em></li>
<li><em><em>Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology</em></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously three important journals for someone doing clinical cancer research. I could ask my institution to start subscribing to these journals, start a personal subscription (I had a personal subscription to <em><em>Nature Clinical Practice Oncology</em></em> for two years before it was renamed to <em><em>Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology</em></em>) which would set me back 150-200 â‚¬ per journal, or I could pay for an individual article (either through my library or directly from the journal). All this requires extra time and money, worth only if I think a paper/journal is really important.</p>
<p><em><em>PLoS Medicine</em></em> is the only open access journal among the 20 most popular journals in my Papers library (The <em><em>BMJ</em></em> has free access to its research articles and is the 24th most popular). Unfortunately there are only a few Open Access journals publishing papers that are relevant to my work.</p>
<p>As many others I do work from home in the evening or on the weekend, or while travelling. I am lucky that I can access my university network through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> and therefore can get fulltext access to journal articles (one of the most important VPN uses for me). But some researchers might not be so lucky, or spend precious extra time setting up and using VPN.</p>
<p>Researchers that work in a poorer country, or for a smaller university or small biotech startup will have much larger problems. Medical doctors in community hospitals or private practice may not have easy access to any of the relevant journals, and they might depend on reprints given to them by colleagues or representatives from drug companies.</p>
<h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3>
<p>If several people work on a research project, they also want to share the relevant literature in the field. Most subscription-based journals retain the copyright to the paper and don't allow storing in a retrieval system or transmitting of papers without permission. This could mean that you can't email the PDF of a paper to a colleague even if you are the author or his institution also has a subscription. And this could also mean that you can't use a reference manager such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.refworks.com/">Refworks</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> to not only share references with your lab colleagues, but also the full-text PDF files. Strictly following the copyright can make something as common as a <em><em>journal club</em></em> a complicated affair.</p>
<h3 id="permissions">Permissions</h3>
<p>As most subscription-based journals retain the copyright to the paper, you have to ask for permissions when reusing tables or figures. Most often this is the case when giving a lecture on a topic. For longer lectures this could mean a large number of required permissions, and the permissions might be granted just for a single occasion. Journals might not care much about using a single figure in a departmental seminar, but it definitely becomes an issue when the lecture is distributed electronically, e.g. as free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm">OpenCourseWare</a> publication of teaching material. Some journals provide Powerpoint slides for the tables and figures and explicitly permit the educational noncommercial use. In my experience most researchers aren't aware that they are using copyrighted material in their slides, and I rarely see the required copyright attributions.</p>
<h3 id="added-services">Added services</h3>
<p>This category has great potential, but is currently not yet that relevant in my daily work. Open Access to fulltext articles allows things that aren't possible or much more complicated with subscription-based access. This includes fulltext searches (to find information not in the title, abstract or keywords), semantically enhanced articles, and article-level metrics (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105124/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/15/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield">recently introduced by PLoS</a>).</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Researchers at large research institutions often have institutional access to most relevant papers. They are often not aware of the restrictions imposed upon them by the copyright of papers retained by most subscription-based journals. Open Access papers not only are freely accessible, but allow the uncomplicated redistribution and reuse for research and teaching, as well as innovative ways to find interesting research.</p>
<p>The perspective of the researcher as a paper author is stuff for another blog post…</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/profile">Anna Kushnir</a> who started it all. Frustrated with the limitations of PubMed when finishing her PhD thesis, she wrote a blog post in March 2008 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/blog/2008/03/22/i-am-not-yelling-not-out-loud">I Am Not Yelling. Not Out Loud.</a>) about her experience. The blog post created quite a stir in the blogosphere, especially among <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://mbanks.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/04/the-anna-kushni.html">science librarians</a>. At the heart of the controversy was Anna's complaint that PubMed is too complicated to use, and that some science librarians felt PubMed simply is complicated and that users such as Anna should take better advantage of the resources available to better use PubMed. David Lipman, director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a> and responsible for PubMed, said:</p>
<blockquote>
Although the current engine works well for some users and some queries, I understand Anna's frustration and we are in the midst of a number of changes that will make PubMed work better for her and many other users.
</blockquote>
<p>In May 2009 a PubMed redesign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/mj09/ppt/sunrise_gillikin/sunrise_2009_gillikin.html">was shown</a> at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Medical Library Association (MLA) in Honolulu, and the presentation explains a lot of the ideas behind the redesign. On September 30 the redesigned PubMed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so09/so09_pm_redesign.html">was unveiled to the public</a>, and as early as next week it will become the default PubMed web interface.</p>

<p>Several science bloggers have already written about the PubMed redesign, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/pubmed&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;-redesign-is-here-to-try/">very detailed blog post</a> by Jacqueline Limpens.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-pubmed">What is PubMed?</h3>
<p>MEDLINE is a database of more than 19 million citations for biomedical articles, hosted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.pubmed.gov/">PubMed</a> is the freely available Web interface to that database. Not only is the content of PubMed available from other databases (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/scholarly_research_analysis/research_discovery/web_of_science">Web of Science</a>), but PubMed can be searched not only via the Web interface, but also from within other applications, e.g. a reference manager such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://mekentosj.com/papers">Papers</a>. And PubMed doesn't cover all scientific journals, many disciplines (e.g. physics, social sciences) aren't included at all. In other words, the Pubmed web interface is not the only way to find biomedical articles, and in fact will not find literature not related to the life sciences. But the PubMed web interface is probably by far the most popular way to search for biomedical literature.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-target-audience">What is the target audience?</h3>
<p>The PubMed website is intended for at least 5 different audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>science librarian</li>
<li>researcher in the life sciences</li>
<li>clinician</li>
<li>patient or patient relative</li>
<li>teacher, high school student, journalist and anybody else interested in life sciences research</li>
</ul>
<p>Before PubMed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/archive//20050113/news/press_releases/free_medline.html">was announced in June 1997 by the U.S. vice president Al Gore</a> as free web-based access to the MEDLINE database, most users were librarians, plus of a small group of academics with paid access (remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/2/321">Grateful Med</a> ?). Now we have a number of target audiences with different experience in literature search strategies and different intentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>librarian vs. academic vs. the general public</li>
<li>basic life sciences research vs. clinical research</li>
</ul>
<p>As PubMed is the most popular but not the only interface to the MEDLINE database, the primary target audience will not be a librarian, but someone with less experience in searching the biomedical literature (and less time). I would lump academics together with the general public here, and think that the typical PubMed search should be as simple as the typical Google search. Everything much more complicated than a simple input box should be moved to an <em><em>advanced search options</em></em> page, or should be done via a different interface to the MEDLINE database.</p>
<p>Searching for clinical literature is very different from searching for basic science research. Here a search is often done to help in the decision making for a particular patient, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> is used to find the most relevant scientific literature (with meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials providing the best evidence).</p>
<p>Searching for basic science literature has very different goals. It is either finding the needle in the haystack, e.g. you want to find all the published literature on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1176325">C3PO</a> gene, or you want to find a review article as an overview over a particular field. But basic science review articles don't have the rigourous tools available to evaluate clinical research mentioned above, and here review articles only differ in the personal perspective of the reviewers and completeness and actuality of the primary literature that was covered. Searching for basic science literature should also be tightly integrated with the other databases at the NCBI. This is done via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery">Entrez Search Page</a>, so that a search for <em><em>C3PO</em></em> also links to the organisms it was described in, e.g. this one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/91px-Tribolium.castaneum.jpg" class="kg-image" width="91" height="120" />
</figure>
<p>I don't think that a search interface to MEDLINE can be good at both the clinical and basic science literature. The current PubMed is much closer to the latter, so I think that the primary target audience for PubMed is the <em><em>academic or general public interest in basic life sciences research</em></em>. A good search interface for the clinical literature would be something very different and has to include both databases of evidence-based evaluations (particularly from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Collaboration</a>) and from ongoing and completed clinical trials (particularly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://clinicaltrials.gov/">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>, just like PubMed also hosted at the NIH).</p>
<h3 id="where-is-web-2-0">Where is Web 2.0?</h3>
<p>A PubMed redesign in 2009 can't be complete without looking at what Web 2.0 has to offer. This means that users should be offered a personal PubMed account that links to their libraries for fulltext articles, stores common searches, creates RSS outputs, allows sharing of search results with other users, publishes a link to an interesting article on Twitter, and possibly other enhancements (e.g. a public profile page of all your PubMed articles, but that wouldn't work without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://themindwobbles.wordpress.com/2009/08/22/breakout-3-author-identity-creating-a-new-kind-of-reputation-online/">author identifiers</a>). This also means a clean design, use of Javascript/AJAX for the user interface, a version for mobile users (particularly iPhone), and frequent small updates instead of a big desgin change every 2-3 years.</p>
<h3 id="and-how-is-the-redesigned-pubmed">And how is the redesigned PubMed?</h3>
<p>After this rather long introduction, what do I like about the PubMed Redesign?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://assets.front-matter.io/ghost/2021/April/13th/web-pubmed.jpeg" class="kg-image" width="506" height="422" />
</figure>
<h3 id="like">Like</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clean, uncluttered design</li>
<li>Saving a search as RSS is faster and more obvious. I hope that this will make many more people use RSS than email alerts for their regular searches (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/06/21/recipe-receiving-journal-table-of-contents-automatically">why I like RSS</a>)</li>
<li>Auto suggest: some of the most popular PubMed searches will be displayed based on the terms entered</li>
<li>Some use of Javascript/AJAX</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dislike">Dislike</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> (the best unique identifier for a paper and the easiest way to link to the full-text article) is still not displayed in the standard abstract view (you find the DOI in the Medline and XML views)</li>
<li>Small design flaw: no easy way to go back from advanced search to basic search</li>
<li>Layout is now different from MyNCBI and the other NCBI databases (maybe this is work in progress)</li>
<li>(As far as I know) no version for mobile users</li>
<li>No send to CiteULike/Connotea/Twitter/FriendFeed, etc. buttons (popular with many journals)</li>
</ul>
<p>The redesign will make it easier for inexperienced users to do quick searches (as mentioned above, probably the target audience). Experienced librarians might like the redesign less, as advanced searches have not become easier. But overall the changes are minor. My biggest complaint is the lack of DOI integration. A wasted opportunity. And – as mentioned above – I think we need a different MEDLINE interface for searching the clinical medicine literature.</p>
<p>How do you like the redesign? Jacqueline Limpens is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025631/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2009/10/01/pubmed&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;-redesign-is-here-to-try/">doing a poll on her blog</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blogging is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090624/full/4591050a.html">a great way to report from a scientific conference</a>. This could be done either with regular blog posts written in the evening or after the conference, and/or live-blogging using tools such as Friendfeed or Twitter. One or more blogging scientists can not only add a unique perspective to the reports about a conference, but for smaller conferences blogging might be the only way to learn more about a conference you were unable to attend in person.</p>
<p>Conference blogging (particularly live-blogging) basically requires four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a wireless network,</li>
<li>a computer or mobile phone with a full battery,</li>
<li>a hashtag (and other tools to find the conference blog posts), and</li>
<li>a blogging policy by the conference organizers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wireless networks are now commonplace, but enough battery power (or power outlets that conference participants can use) can be difficult. A hashtag such as <em><em>#solo09</em></em> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London</a> is essential for live-blogging using Twitter.</p>
<p>The big problem is the blogging policy, or rather that there usually is a policy only for traditional media, but not for blogging. The blogging from the Cold Spring Harbor <em><em>Biology of Genomes</em></em> meeting in May by Daniel MacArthur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/06/on_the_challenges_of_conferenc.php">started a very helpful discussion about blogging policies</a>. It is impossible to write anything specific about a conference – and that's the stuff that is most interesting – without a permission from the conference organizer and speaker. This is best done before the conference has started. A July <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7252/full/460152a.html">editorial</a> argues that an opt-out policy, where everything can be blogged about unless the speaker or poster presenter specifically says so, is a reasonable alternative.</p>
<p>The organizers of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.genetics2009.de/">Annual Meeting of the German Genetics Society</a> that took place two weeks ago in Cologne did this right. Not only did they invite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> to become the official conference blogger, but they also put up a prominent link to his blog posts on the conference homepage, and they asked every speaker before the conference whether Alex would be allowed to blog about their talks. Because his blog on scienceblogs.de (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.scienceblogs.de/alles-was-lebt">Alles was lebt</a>) is in German, he decided to put up his blog posts here. I've asked him a few questions about this experience.</p>

<h3 id="1-did-you-have-fun-being-the-official-blogger-for-the-german-genetics-society-meeting">1. Did you have fun being the official blogger for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://www.genetics2009.de/">German Genetics Society Meeting</a>?</h3>
<p>This conference blogging job was a first for me in many ways. I usually blog in German, so I wasn't sure if I would be able to bring more than my dry, scientific English. I also knew beforehand that there would be no theme, that the meeting was a general one. I would have at least to give the impression of having understood the basics of the talks. There would be no flitting about from talk to talk, I wanted to get whole sessions without interruption.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I also got to know lots of people, many more than I would have as a lowly PhD student. I attended a conference I almost certainly would not have without the invitation to come and blog.</p>
<p>And, as any other (science)blogger will tell you, blogging is a labour of love (don't stab me in the back now!). So yes, I had a great time!</p>
<h3 id="2-blogging-about-the-conference-must-have-been-a-lot-of-work-">2. Blogging about the conference must have been a lot of work!</h3>
<p>About as much as I expected. I was frantically typing away at my little netbook keyboard during the talks to take notes, and used any spare time to put together the posts. So I did not have as easy a time as regular conference attendees. No problem, I came to do a job!</p>
<h3 id="3-did-you-meet-any-other-science-bloggers-at-the-conference">3. Did you meet any other science bloggers at the conference?</h3>
<p>As far as I'm aware, I was the only blogger attending, and also the only one tweeting from the sessions (no worries, no unpublished data got out that route).</p>
<h3 id="4-what-was-the-feedback-from-the-speakers-what-was-your-experience-getting-permissions-from-speakers-to-blog-about-their-sessions">4. What was the feedback from the speakers? What was your experience getting permissions from speakers to blog about their sessions?</h3>
<p>I got the whole range. From the really open “Go ahead! Write what you want, put it online. I'll talk about some unpublished stuff as well, but I don't mind” to some who are not interested in getting their work out into a blog at all. Great news for the conference blogging crowd: the balance was tipped more to the pro side! Most of the speakers came out somewhere in between those two sides, probably being a bit cautious about that whole strange blogging stuff. But I got mostly positive feedback from them, and I believe the next blogger will have an easier time when blogging about their talks!</p>
<h3 id="5-what-tips-would-you-give-a-conference-organizer-who-wants-to-promote-blogging">5. What tips would you give a conference organizer who wants to promote blogging?</h3>
<p>They should make clear from the start if blogging about the talks is generally OK. That doesn't mean all of the speakers have to allow blogging about their talk, but an official position will help everyone involved. You also don't need to have an <em><em>official</em></em> blogger, but especially at smaller meetings asking someone to blog beforehand is probably the only chance to get a blogger there at all.</p>
<p>I also have advice for speakers: Start your talk by telling your audience if blogging about it is OK! If a part of your talk is unpublished, tell them that as well. Or put an icon on your slides to indicate which is good to blog about, for example as Daniel MacArthur from the Genetic Future blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105344/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/07/conference_blogging_icons_for.php">has proposed</a>. If bloggers know beforehand if and what part of the talk is good to go, they will be more willing to take notes in earnest!</p>
<p>Now that my guest posting here at Martin's blog comes to an end, I would like to leave you with one of the last impressions, a rather lucky shot of Cologne Cathedral I took while leaving. Many thanks to Martin for hosting this conference blog!</p>

<h3 id="session-v">Session V</h3>
<p>Friday ended with two talks in session V, the first by Tony Hyman from the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden. He looked at the ways that cells structure and organize their cytoplasm by comparison with non-biological systems.</p>
<p>Next up was a talk on the innate immune response against the influenza virus by University of Freiburg's Otto Haller. When viruses infect mammalian hosts, a battle between interferons and virulence factors starts to rage. The interferon-induced GTPase Mx1 is an important resistance factor against influenza A viruses in mice. Most lab mouse strains are natural knockouts for Mx1, so they needed to create congenic, wild-type Mx1-expressing mice to research its function.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Mx1 expression protects mice against the usually lethal 1918 Spanish flu influenza A, even at high doses. Mx proteins are highly conserved in mammalian species and belong to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases. Otto Haller presented new and unpublished data (obtained in collaboration with Oliver Daumke's group at the Berlin Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine) on the role of the structure of the human MxA GTPase in repressing the virus.</p>
<h3 id="session-vii">Session VII</h3>
<p>The final session of the meeting started with a talk by Andrew McMahon from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in Cambridge, US, that I sadly missed. But one missed talk during the whole meeting is not that bad now, don't you think?<br />
Ueli Grossniklaus then talked about epigenetics in the struggle between the two parental genomes of an Arabidopsis embryo. At the University of Zürich in Switzerland, his group is looking at the timing of expression of paternal alleles and their phenotypic consequences, all controlled by the maternal genome.</p>
<p>The last talk was given by Bruce Beutler from the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, US. He is looking into the ways in which the mammalian immune system is able to recognize microbes as foreign, and then mount an adequate response. A first answer was found when the receptor for LPS, a component of all Gram-negative microbes, was identified by positional cloning as Tlr4, a Toll-like receptor. You perhaps know Toll as a developmental gene in the Drosophila embryo, but in adult flies, it is required for the immune response to fungal and bacterial infections. So perhaps other Toll-like receptors also recognize other microbial ligands? Yes, and Bruce Beutler's group has been looking into the signaling pathways that lead from recognition by a Toll-like receptor to the induction of cellular responses. He and his group have used a forward genetic screen of randomly mutagenized mice. To date, they have generated over 100,000 mutant lines, and identified 32 mutations affecting Toll-like receptor signaling. This allowed them to deduce biochemical pathways that mediate much of the innate immune response. A similar feat was done with the genes involved in the resistance against mouse cytomegalovirus, with susceptibility mutations found in sensing and signaling pathways, but also in homeostasis and in development.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032254/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p>
<p>Saturday had two more sessions before the end of the meeting. Irina Stancheva from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh started us into the day with a talk on epigenetics in mouse development.</p>
<p>One form of epigenetic silencing is methylation of cytosine bases in DNA. This is done by DNA methyltransferases like Dnmt1 for maintenance methylation, or Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b for de novo methylation, at CpG sequences enriched at promoters. During mouse embryonic development, DNA methylation is essential, for a loss of either of the DNA methyltransferases is embryonically lethal. Methylation and demethylation during development is surprisingly dynamic, with loss and new gain, and differences between the embryo and the trophectoderm. Besides the Dnmts, there are further proteins involved in the regulation of methylation levels. One interesting protein here is Lsh, a chromatin remodelling ATPase belonging to the SNF2 family. It seems to have a low ATPase activity in vitro, but it cooperates with several known factors like the DNA methyltransferases and Histone deacetylases. With mouse promoter microarrays, Irina Stancheva's group compared wildtype and Lsh knockout cells, and found a reduction in promoter methylation when Lsh is missing. The patterns of DNA methylation observed in Lsh null cells suggest that this protein has a role in developmentally-programmed methylation events in the early mouse embryo.</p>
<p>Dominique Soldati-Favre from the University of Geneva in Switzerland gave an interesting talk about her work on apicomplexan parasites. This phylum includes important human and animal pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum causing toxoplasmosis and malaria respectively. They belong to the clade of Chromalveolates, whose ancestor acquired a plastid organelle by the secondary endosymbiosis of an alga. While some members of this clade are free living organisms or predators the Apicomplexa have evolved as obligate intracellular parasites. These parasites have developed an elaborated strategy to actively penetrate the host cells by a mechanism distinct from phagocytosis and involving gliding motility. This active mode of entry is favorable to the parasites, because this way they can evade the host cell defense mechanisms. To identify and study the molecular components of the vital process leading to host invasion, the Soldati's group has developed genetic tools beginning from reliable DNA transfection up to the establishment of an inducible expression system for the malaria parasites based on transcription machinery elements similar to those found in plants. Studies performed on T. gondii have established that the mechanism of host cell entry is the result of a concerted action of adhesins involved in the attachment of the parasite to the host cell, the actin cytoskeleton and myosin motors that relocalize these adhesins from anterior to posterior pole of the parasite, and proteases that finally release these adhesins from the parasite surface.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033114/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p>
<p>As promised, I attended the second Plant Genetics session of the meeting, thus missing the Epigenetics session.</p>
<p>I learned an important lesson at the first talk by Juliette de Meaux from the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research: Bring sweets for the audience, and you have everyone on your side! Her research is on the molecular basis of variation in the life cycle of the model plant species <em><em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em></em>. Natural Arabidopsis strains grow in very different climates, and therefore have to adapt their annual life cycle to the environmental conditions: germinating their seeds early or late, flowering quickly after germinating or growing vegetatively for months. The ability not to germinate although there are good conditions is called seed dormancy. This can be a very important trait, for example if the Arabidopsis strain grows at a location where a short favorable period is followed by a recurring period detrimental to the growth of the plant. Then the plants which did not germinate even during the short favorable period have an advantage. But such changes in seed germination time need the whole life cycle to be fine-tuned: For the seeds of the following season to be ready before winter, the growth rate has to faster, or the flowering time shorter.</p>
<p>Because of the varying locations where Arabidopsis grows, there should be variation in life history strategies to be found for selection to act upon. For the model system of germination rate, Juliette de Meaux' lab found a high variations in 180 natural genotypes they looked at. Some strains germinated at the day of harvest, while others didn't germinate at all even 250 days after harvest, and most somewhere in between. If seeds were exposed to a cold treatment 250 days after harvest (to simulate winter), the strains that didn't germinate after the 250 days suddenly started to germinate, while others decreased in their germination rate at longer times of cold exposure. Such and other measurements allowed for the analysis of a very complex dataset to derive the different strategies of life history in Arabidopsis. For example, there is a correlation of growth rate and flowering time to be found, but only in strains growing to the north (of Europe), not in the southern strains. They also looked at the molecular basis of this life history variation, and the consequences of it, which were interesting parts of the talk in and of themselves.</p>
<p>The second talk was by Rüdiger Simon from the Institute of Genetics at the University of Düsseldorf. Plants also possess stem cells, and they are located in niches (in plants called meristems) at the tips of the shoot and the root. For the shoot apical meristem (SAM), it is already known that it is composed of the stem cells and an organizing center underneath. The stem cell proliferation is regulated by a negative feedback loop: Cells in the organizing center express Wuschel, which promotes stem cell fate, but stem cells express Clavata3, that represses Wuschel via the receptors Clavata1 and Clavata2. Apart from that, there is a second negative feedback mechanism of regulating Wuschel activity known. But according to computer simulations by Rüdiger Simon and his colleagues, there are further factors needed to explain the observed distributions of cells and gene expression. They looked for such factors, and found the coryne mutant, which resembles known clavata mutants; it must be in the same pathway.</p>
<p>Rüdiger Simon's lab also looked at the root tip stem cell niche, if it is perhaps also regulated by a Clavata-like pathway. Interestingly, they were able to find a Clavata3-related peptide in Cle40, that regulates the Wuschel homolog WOX5. While this is similar to the situation in the SAM, there are also differences: WOX5 is produced in the QC, which resembles the organizing centre that expresses Wuschel , but Cle40 is not produced by the stem cells, but by already differentiated cells derived from those stem cells.</p>
<p>Next, Bhupendra Chaudary from Gautam Buddha University in Greater Noida, India, gave a short presentation on the fate of duplicated genes in polyploid cotton. After a genome duplication event, the evolutionary constraints on duplicated genes are relaxed, and one way change is possible is by generating differences in expression, allowing for subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. They looked at expression differences in homoeologous genes (pairs of genes duplicated by a polyploidization event) in species of the cotton Gossypium, where parental diploid genomes as well as allopolyploids can be found. Interestingly, none of the parental genomes showed a dominant expression in the hybrids globally, but some tissue-specific transcriptional subfunctionalization.</p>
<p>The last talk of the session was given by Frank Kempken from the University of Kiel on mitochondrial mRNA editing in plants. Mitochondria possess their own rudimentary transcription and translation machinery, and in between they change the mRNAs in a way the nucleus doesn't: they edit the mRNA sequence, usually by exchanging a C for an U to create novel stop codons, or to modify the amino acid sequence. How this is done is largely unknown.</p>
<p>Frank Kempken's lab developed a system to work with isolated mitochondria, because genetic engineering of them in plants is not possible, and <em><em>in vitro</em></em> approaches have serious drawbacks. In their '<em><em>in organello</em></em>' system, they can electroporate the isolated mitochondria in buffer, and observe the editing done to the expressed mRNAs. This allowed them to observe correct recognition of editing sites of Arabidopsis mRNAs in the mitochondria of maize, for example, or that mRNAs from chloroplasts are not edited in mitochondria. This would at least partially be expected, but somehow the plastid transcripts are not recognized by the editing machinery in the mitochondria.</p>
<p>Using a novel binding assay (which requires 10 liters of Arabidopsis cell culture per experiment, whew!) they were able to find proteins that bind to mRNAs at editing sites. A knockout mutant of one of them leads to growth retardation and smaller plants, exactly what one would expect when mitochondria don't function properly anymore.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033341/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p>
<p>The last session on Thursday was split into two talks by Philippe Sansonetti from the Institute Pasteur in Paris and Julian Parkhill from the Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Great Britain. Both talked about pathogenic microbes, but from a different perspective.</p>
<p>After Philippe Sansonetti told us about <em><em>Shigella</em></em> and the innate immune system during invasion of the gut epithelium, Julian Parkhill gave us some insights into two (genomically) very different organisms. <em><em>Salmonella typhi</em></em>, responsible for typhoid fever, has evolved relatively recently by changing its niche; it went from being a gut pathogen to a systemic pathogen. This can be seen in its genome, because its evolution is not characterized by the gain of genes, but actually by the loss of many genes through single mutations. For bacteria, <em><em>Salmonella typhi</em></em> is rather strange: There is almost no recombination between strains, so there are very few SNPs that can by typed. By looking at 200 genes in about 200 strains, they found 88 SNPs in total! Evolutionarily, their data point to mostly long-term neutral mutations, with only very few genes to be found that show evidence of positive selection. But the SNP data they acquired could be put to good use nonetheless: They were able to do an epidemiological analysis in the field by collecting S. typhi strains around Kathmandu.</p>
<p>The opposite of <em><em>S. typhi</em></em> in terms of recombination and SNPs is <em><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></em>, which comprises a hugely diverse group of freely recombining strains. With next generation sequencing, they were able to track the appearance and travels of a specific strain around the world. They even got enough SNPs in their dataset to be able to distinguish strains from different wards in a single hospital!<br />
The talk was also a lesson in technological progress: While the sequencing of the <em><em>Salmonella typhi</em></em> genome a few years ago took 1.5 years, the next generation sequencing of <em><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></em> allowed the analysis of 66 genomes per run and week. Finally, we had a glimpse into the future: They are getting into single cell genome sequencing by doing laser capture microsdissection, and are already able to reach about 98% coverage!</p>
<p>Following this last talk of the day, the German Genetics Society awarded the honorary membership to Rolf Knippers. At least German speaking biologists should know him by name because of his well-known (and great, in my opinion) textbook <em><em>Molekulare Genetik</em></em> (Molecular Genetics), which first appeared in the early 1970s. But that was not the only reason for the award. Actually, Rolf Knippers has been a very good researcher and teacher, too! I didn't know him apart from his textbook before, but the laudatio and his acceptance speech (which he started by humbly asking if he deserved the award) made me wish I had met him earlier, perhaps as a student or even as a member of his lab.</p>

<p>Both sessions had some interesting talks, so it was really hard to decide between attending Cellular Genetic Mechanisms or Human Genetics, but in the end I went to the former.</p>
<p>The first talk by Marina Rodnina from the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry is not easy to put into words. Not because of a bad presentation, I should add! Her work on biochemical properties of translation involves kinetic data of a row of proteins involved in the phases of translation: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling.</p>
<p>I'll give you a short summary of the initiation of translation in bacteria: First the 30S subunit of the ribosome binds a mRNA and the initiator tRNA with the help of effector proteins to form the 30S initiation complex. The 50S subunit then binds to that to form the 70S initiation complex. By fluorescently labelling all of the components of the complex, they were able to measure the rate constants (how do they bind and dissociate from the ribosome) and then calculate the binding rates to find the order of binding. This is hardest to establish for the mRNA, because of control elements like the composition of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or secondary structures. But ignoring all of these elements, the most significant factor at this step is the mRNA concentration. Looking at secondary structure, the unfolding of the mRNA is the slow step after a quick binding. This represents a kind of stability switch to enable correct start codon recognition. Not only during initiation, but also for elongation Marina Rodnina's lab could show that a lot of checks are kinetic in nature. Essentially, this can be summarized by the concept of induced fit: correct substrates are selectively stabilized by accelerating their forward steps.</p>
<p>Following was a short presentation by Matthias Schäfer on unpublished research. At the ETH Zürich in Switzerland, he is looking into the molecular role of protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the epidermis.</p>
<p>Aria Baniahmad fom the Jena University Hospital, Germany, talked about an interesting connection of telomerase activity and androgens in prostate cancer. There, telomerase is usually active, as in many cancers to allow the cancer cell to divide indefinitely. Androgens repress telomerase activity, which is probably one reason why prostate cancer occurs later in life, when androgen levels decrease in men.</p>
<p>The decrease of telomerase activity is based on binding of the androgen receptor to the promoter of the catalytic telomerase subunit hTERT. In many prostate cancers, an androgen receptor with a specific point mutation can be found. This mutated AR's binding to the telomerase promoter is weaker, which results in increased telomerase expression.</p>
<p>The session was closed with a talk by Thorsten Hoppe from the Institute for Genetics of Köln University, who presented intruiging, but unpublished data about his research on ubiquitin and ageing in <em><em>C. elegans</em></em>.</p>

<p>The first session on Friday started with a talk by Frauke Melchior from the ZMBP in Heidelberg on SUMO. Apart from being interesting to work with, it also is good for some rather funny paper titles</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032512im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>At the start, she gave a short introduction on the proterties of SUMO. It is similar to Ubiquitin (it stands for Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier) and gets covalently bound to lysines of hundreds of proteins to change their protein or DNA interactions, localization, or activity. A good example I also know from my work is the yeast DNA repair helicase Srs2, which only interacts with the SUMOylated form of the replication protein PCNA at the replication fork to suppress recombination. Many protein-protein interactions that are dependent on SUMOylation can be traced back to non-covalent recognition of a SUMO-interaction motif, SIM.</p>
<p>Like with ubiquitin, there is an enzymatic cascade to bind a SUMO unit to a target protein; however, there is only one E1 activating and one E2 conjugating enzyme, and a handful of E3 SUMO ligases (compared to hundreds for the ubiquitin pathway). Target recognition is not understood very well, but there is a known consensus site wich is recognized by the E2 enyzme for SUMOylation. The problem is: many proteins are SUMOylated at non-consensus sites. Another mechanism turns the usual direction of the pathway on its head: The target proteins interacts with SUMO via a SIM, while it is still bound to the E2 enzyme. This allows the E2 to transfer SUMO to the target protein.</p>
<p>Finally, Frauke Melchior told us about an interesting pair of proteins that are involved in SUMOylation: RanGAP (RanGTPase activating protein) interacts with RanBP2 at the nuclear pore complex after it gets SUMOylated. RanBP2 itself is a SUMO E3 ligase, but not for RanGAP. Without going into too much detail (unpublished data), the story unraveled by Frauke Melchior and her coworkers showed a really complex and intriguing picture of the role SUMO plays in regulating the activity of this complex and the effect on nuclear transport.</p>
<p>In the second talk of the session, Chris Wylie from the Developmental Biology division of the Cincinnati Children's hospital threw out the simple model of germ cell migration in mouse embryos found in the textbooks: During embryo development, the stem cells of the gametes, the germ line stem cells, have to migrate to their niche in the gonads. They start their travels in a structure called the allantois, go through the hindgut and from there to the genital ridges, where the gonads will form. Classically, it was thought that long range signals guide their migration. But this is problematic, because the target organ supposed to produce the guiding signal is not formed when the germ cells start their migration, and during the migration the surroundings and distances will change dramatically! That means there must be short range signals for guidance.</p>
<p>A nice example to test this is the trip from the midline above the gut to the genital ridges. Germ cells that stay at the midline will die by apoptosis. The previously known stem cell survival factor Steel is involved in preventing apoptosis in the cells. Its concentration decreases from the ridges to the midline; adding Steel everywhere experimentally saves the midline germ cells from apoptosis, while blocking Steel everywhere kills the germ cells laterally. They were able to show that Steel is not only involved in apoptosis, but also in the migration and proliferation of the germ cells. Steel is not only required at the late migration from the midline to the genital ridges; from the start in the allantois, loss of Steel leads to loss of germ cell number and migration.</p>
<p>Essentially, this means that not only is Steel one (of probably many) short range signals, but it also travels with the germ cells along their migration route, giving them a mobile stem cell niche!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031744/http://network.nature.com/people/alexander-knoll/profile">Alex Knoll</a> reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p>
<p>Just after lunch the next decision: Neurogenetics or Evolution? Here I went with the topic that is less far from my field, and attended the evolution session. Welcome to the modern times, because next generation sequencing and high throughput are the way to go!</p>
<p>These were the methods of choice for Julia Zeitlinger from the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City to compare transcription factor binding sites between several Drosophila species. This goes back to the question, which process contributes more to evolution: mutations in the protein-coding parts of genes, or the sequences needed for the transcriptional regulation of these genes, the so-called cis-regulatory elements. There is evidence in some organisms of a high turnover of transcription factor binding sites, and Julia Zeitlinger wanted to compare these in the genus Drosophila. This was done with chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, where you analyze the sequence of DNA fragments to which a target protein like a transcription factor is bound. Earlier, this was followed by hybidisation of microarrays (ChIP-chip), today these DNA fragments can be directly sequenced with next generation methods (ChIP-seq). They chose the dorso-ventral patterning in the Drosophila embryo as a model system, with transcription factors like Twist that are well studied, and that have conserved binding sites. Surprisingly, they found that Twist binds to about 8 times more positions than were expected; sometimes Twist bound at more than one position at target genes.</p>
<p>Across Drosophila species the binding sites of Twist were very similar, especially near transcriptional start sites the positions are mostly conserved. Although movements of binding sites exist, they are rare. So it seems that there is evolutionary pressure to maintain the sites.</p>
<p>Also about the evolutionary contributions of cis-regulatory regions was the talk by Diethard Tautz from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plants, Germany. But he addressed them with population genetics of wild house mouse strains. With microarray and qPCR experiments, his lab was able to find that the majority of genes they looked at follow a neutral evolution. When this is not the case, most of those genes show only tissue-specific changes in expression, which points to cis-regulatory elements.</p>
<p>They also found a newly evolved gene in the mouse: In a region that is completely free of annotated transcripts in other mammals, one transcript can be found in the mouse. Poldi, as it is called, is expressed in the mouse testis and encodes a non-protein coding RNA. They were able to follow its birth in the genus Mus, where it appeared about 2.5 million years ago by changes in promoter regions. And although Poldi appeared relatively recently, it plays a role in the mouse. A knockout results in mice with reduced sperm motility and smaller testis, because several chromatin-regulating proteins show different expression levels in the absence of Poldi.</p>
<p>Now on to some computational biology by Andrew Hufton from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. He analyzed a special kind of cis-regulatory elements: the so-called conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), that don't show much chance even over great evolutionary distances. Why do they exist? There are two competing hypotheses; either the CNEs repress genome rearrangements, or they promote the retention of duplicate genes nearby. To test both hypotheses, Andrew Hufton identified so-called phylogenetically conserved non-coding elements. These are elements associated with gene families and are not biased for one of the hypotheses. With experiments in zebrafish, he found that most of the PCNEs are enhancers, sequences involved in the regulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>Concerning the two competing hypotheses, he found a strong association between PCNE and synteny conservation – the first hypothesis: the PCNEs are enriched around genes with an ancient gene order. For the retention of duplicated genes, he showed us an alternative model.</p>
<p>In the last short talk of this session, Stephan Greiner told us about a plant with a strange inheritance. At the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology at Potsdam-Golm in Germany, he is working on the Evening Primrose Oenothera. It combines some very interesting genetic features like easy crossings between species, fertility of the resulting hybrids, biparental transmission of chloroplasts (that are usually inherited maternally) and something very strange called permanent-translocation heterozygosity: The chromosomes of Oenothera easily break at the centromeres, so that translocations of chromosome arms happen. This leads to rings or chains of chromosomes during meiosis that suppress homologous recombination and the intermixing of haploid chromosomes. In the end, there are a handful of stable genomes that a transmitted stably, and a hybrid plant with a combination of two of these genomes will always have hybrid offspring.<br />
Add in the possibility to exchange one of several different chloroplast genomes in only two generations, and you will be able to generate compatibility charts of nuclear and chloroplast genomes, where lethal combinations and less severe phenotypes occur. Taken one step further, it is possible to identify speciation genes in the chloroplast genome.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post by Alex Knoll reporting from the German Genetics Society Meeting in Cologne.</em></em></p>
<p>This time I had to decide between two parallel sessions for the first time at this meeting. Plant genetics or Development? Coming from plant molecular genetics myself, there perhaps was a ready-made decision, but I decided otherwise. There will be a second plant genetics session, and work with the axolotl and spiders lured me to the developmental biologists. But I had a rather hard time following all the new information, so please bear with me! To get at least a little bit of information about the plant genetics session, take a look into the meeting program for the abstracts (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031830/http://conventus.de/fileadmin/media/2009/genetik/PDF/2009_09_14_Genetik_2009_Programm_klein.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>Elly Tanaka from the Center for Regenerative Therapies in Dresden, Germany is working with the axolotl, a salamander, as her model to research the molecular and cellular events needed for spinal cord regeneration. Choosing the axolotl was a good idea because it can regenerate lots of tissues and organs, it even grows back whole legs and its tail. On the other hand, her group had to develop all of the molecular genetics fresh from the start, which was quite a lot of work I guess. But they did it, and now have EST sequences, can do single cell electroporation for gene transformations, morpholino knockdown of gene expression is possible. They were able to get transgenes transferred through the germline, can express genes in specific tissues and establish cell cultures. Quite a set, isn't it?</p>
<p>This enabled Elly Tanaka's lab to look at the events after the axolotl loses its tail by a cut, specifically how the spinal cord is able to grow back. There are two basic ideas how this is done: either it grows from the end, or it expands by cell division within the spinal cord. They found that the second hypothesis is true, because a about 500 Âµm long zone right after the cut gives rise to the cells of the regenerated spinal cord. By looking at molecular markers at this zone, they were able to determine that the glial cells are the progenitors for the regeneration, and they need to revert to a more primitive state.</p>
<p>The second invited speaker of this session, Thomas Klein from the Institute of Genetics at the University of Düsseldorf, spoke about the newly analyzed gene Lgd in the fly <em><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></em> that regulates the activity of the well-known Notch gene by a new mechanism. Since this is about unpublished work, I won't go into more detail here.</p>
<p>Of the three short presentations in this session, the talk of Annegret Bördlein from the Institute of Human Genetics in Erlangen, Germany, also contained essentially unpublished data.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am free to write about the other two talks! Thomas Widmann from the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden looked at the cell shape changes in the imaginal disc in Drosophila. This structure of the fly larva will later give rise to parts of the outside of the adult body, including the wings (who would have guessed?). In the wing disc epithelium there are to cell layers that chance their shape during development: One flattens, the other elongates to columns. Thomas Widmann was able to find the two transcription factors Dpp and Wingless implicated in this shape change, since columnar cells lacking these factors are shorter. How is this done in the cell? The actin-myosin cytoskeleton builds a meshwork underneath the plasma membrane to generate tension, and the amount of force is controlled by Rho1 that can phosphorylate Myosin II. By downregulating Rho1, the cell get elongated, its overexpression shortens them. Dpp is one factor that enhances the activity of Rho1. That way, Dpp and Rho1 maintain the length in these cells.</p>
<p>Finally Wim Damen told us about his work on the developmental processes in the spider <em><em>Achaearanea tepidariorum</em></em>. At the Deparment of Genetics at the University of Jena, he is looking into segmentation processes. What happens during segmentation is very well understood in Drosophila, where a gene cascade forms all of the segments at approximately the same time. In vertebrates, the somites are comparable as a segmentation process, but here one forms after the other. Wim Damen found that in the spider, the anterior and central segments are formed like in insects rapidly and almost at the same time, but the posterior segments are formed one by one like in vertebrates. Here are even homologous genes like Notch and Wnt8 required for the segmentation. In the central region, Hunchback is essential for the production of the spider's legs. After RNAi knockdown of Hunchback, the spiders lack some of their legs because the L1, 2 and 4 segments don't form. This combination of insect and vertebrate-like processes during segmentation probably means that also their last common ancestor possessed both mechanisms.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><em>Another guest post from Alex Knoll reporting from the German Genetics Conference in Cologne.</em></em></p>
<p>Dusko Ehrlich fom Jouy en Josas in France started off the second session of the meeting. He is working with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003105714/http://www.metahit.eu/">MetaHIT project</a>, which tries to do a metagenomic analysis of the human intestinal tract. This is interesting because each individual human carries about ten times more microbial cell in the gut than there are human cells in the whole body! These microbes provide the interface between the food we take in and the epithelial cells of the gut. There, they play many roles not only in metabolising materials and molecules we are not capable of, but they also produce vitamins for us and help the immune system. It is therefore very important to understand this further organ of our body, as Dusko Ehrlich called it.</p>
<p>The MetaHIT project takes many approaches to understand the interaction between the human intestinal microbes and human phenotypes like obesity ore bowel diseases. For example, they want to sequence a reference gene set and then look for associations of these genes with diseases. The reference gene set is produced by Solexa paired-end sequencing of samples from 124 individuals, which produced almost 0.6 terabases of sequence in total already! From these sequences contigs are produced and ORFs are predicted, which are almost completey of bacterial origin. This then allows for the comparison of bacterial genes and genomes between the sampled individuals, and also the establishment of a 'minimal metagenome' of the gut ecosystem for absolutely required functions.</p>
<p>The second talk was really interesting to me: In <em><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></em> the male flies perform a courtship dance to win over the female. Barry Dickson from the Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna is looking for the genetic neurobiologic basis of this behaviour.</p>
<p>The fruitless gene, which produces a transcription factor, is absolutely required for the courtship of male flies; females don't produce a protein product due to alternative splicing. But when females carry the male form of the fru gene, they show the typical male courtship behaviour. This means fruitless is some kind of molecular switch for male behaviour in Drosophila by programming the nervous system. So they looked at neurons that express the fru gene with the help of reporter genes and found sensory, central and motor neurons that need to be active for male courtship. Dickson's lab was able to assemble a digital atlas of fru neurons, with stunning pictures, and were able to derive a 'wiring diagram'. Just six easy steps: Starting from fru-expressing olfactory receptor neurons that specifically sense pheromones it only takes this few neural connections to motor output in wing muscles that are required for the courtship song!</p>
<p>Now the group is trying to go the high throughput route by teaching a computer to analyze the courtship behaviour by itself, and the first results look very promising.</p>
<p>The third talk by Andrei Lupas of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, was about the genetic basis of protein fold evolution. Autonomously folding units in proteins are called domains, and usually the fold of a domain is conserved with a high evolutionary permanence.</p>
<p>Surprisingly for me, there are only about 10Â³ basic folds, that all were established around the time of the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms.<br />
But there is the potential for a fold change in domains by specific alterations that go back to point mutations, deletions, insertions or recombination at the level of DNA. To understand how these changes come about, Lupas' group is looking at experimental changes and their outcome. For example, beta-propellers are structures that arise by repeating a single 'blade' a certain number of times. Actually, all present beta-propellers probably all go back to one ancestral blade that was amplified several times. How large can a propeller domain become? The biggest propeller in databases has 10 blades, a 14-blade propeller in yeast forms a split between blades 7 and 8. But Lupas was able to produce a 12-bladed propeller.</p>
