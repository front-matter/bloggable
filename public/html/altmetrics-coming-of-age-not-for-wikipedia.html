<p>Ten days ago Information Standards Quarterly (ISQ) published a <a href="http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/2013/v25no2/">special issue on altmetrics</a>. I was the guest editor for the five altmetrics articles, and in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.01">editorial</a> that I titled <strong><strong>Altmetrics have come of age</strong></strong> I argued that</p>
<blockquote>
We no longer need to talk about whether it is possible to reliably collect altmetrics, or whether this is valuable information that can complement citations and usage statistics.
</blockquote>
<p>In June we have seen that the National Information Standards Organization (<a href="http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</a>) was <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/isqv25no2.2013.07">awarded a grant</a> by the <a href="http://www.sloan.org/">Sloan Foundation</a> to develop standards and recommended best practices for altmetrics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Wikipedia - which is of course an important source of altmetrics information and was also mentioned in the editorial - doesn’t think so. When you try to go to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Altmetrics&amp;redirect=no">Altmetrics</a> page on the English Wikipedia, you get this:</p>

</figure>
<p>In other words, you are redicted to a short section on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor#Article_level_metrics_and_altmetrics">Impact Factor</a> page. I would go and start an altmetrics (and article-level metrics) page, but with my professional involvement in altmetrics it is difficult to write from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">neutral point of view</a>, one of the core Wikipedia policies.</p>
<p><em>Update August 13, 2013: We now have a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics">altmetrics</a> Wikipedia page thanks to the hard work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Egonw">Egon Willighagen</a> and others.</em></p>
