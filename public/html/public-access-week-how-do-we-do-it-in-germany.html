<p>Starting this week, papers submitted from NIH-funded research have to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm" data-cite-meta="{}">made publicly available <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm?</strong>)</span></a> no later than 12 months after publication. But what is the current situation in Germany, especially mandatory Open Access?</p>

In contrast to the new NIH public access policy (and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/Policy/index.htm" data-cite-meta="{}">Welcome Trust <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/Policy/index.htm">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/Policy/index.htm?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.hhmi.org/about/research/journals/main?action=search" data-cite-meta="{}">Howard Hughes Medical Institute <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.hhmi.org/about/research/journals/main?action=search">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.hhmi.org/about/research/journals/main?action=search?</strong>)</span></a>), there is no mandatory Open Access in any of these organizations.</p>
