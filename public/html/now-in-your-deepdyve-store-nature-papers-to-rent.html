<p>Articles published in <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Biotechnology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Cell Biology</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Medicine</em></em> or <em><em>Nature Chemical Biology</em></em> are now available for renting from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.deepdyve.com/nature" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110903091305/http://www.deepdyve.com/nature&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,23]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.deepdyve.com/nature&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2011,9]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nature Journals Now Available  DeepDyve&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">DeepDyve <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.deepdyve.com/nature">(<span>“Nature Journals Now Available DeepDyve,”</span> 2011)</span></a>. Downloading or printing is not possible, and the $3.99 rental is for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Later this month, Nature plans to release the nature.com reader for the iPad. Monthy access to Nature (again read-only) will cost $9.99. For more information see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/rental.html" data-cite-meta="{}">yesterday’s press release <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/rental.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611024706/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/rental.html?</strong>)</span></a>.</p>
<p>In the discussion of subscriptions vs. author-pays for scholarly papers we sometimes forget that it’s really a question of how much we are willing to pay. I’m looking forward to the nature.com app for the iPad, and $9.99 per month seems reasonable. I would not rent a single article for $3.99 – this should either be $0.99 or give me the PDF that I can download and print, something that subscription journals typically charge $10-$30.</p>
