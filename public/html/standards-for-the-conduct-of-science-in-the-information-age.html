<p>Assuming our airports are again open next weekend, I will be attending a meeting organized by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.nsf.gov/" data-cite-meta="{}">NSF <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.nsf.gov/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.nsf.gov/?</strong>)</span></a> (National Science Foundation) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.eurohorcs.org/E/Pages/home.aspx" data-cite-meta="{}">EuroHORCS <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.eurohorcs.org/E/Pages/home.aspx">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.eurohorcs.org/E/Pages/home.aspx?</strong>)</span></a> (European Heads of Research Councils) on <em><em>Changing the Conduct of Science in the Information Age</em></em> in Washington on April 26.

But defining and adhering to standards will enable or enhance a number of very interesting ways to conduct and report science in the information age.</p>

<p>Improving the conduct of science through digital technology requires standards for linking to and formatting scholarly resources. These standards should be coordinated by independent organizations that are not restricted to geographic areas or particular research domains.</p>
<h3 id="data-access">Data access</h3>
<p>Digital Object Identifiers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.doi.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">DOIs <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.doi.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.doi.org/?</strong>)</span></a>) are the primary system to link to digital content. The International <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.datacite.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">DataCite <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.datacite.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.datacite.org/?</strong>)</span></a> initiative is the DOI registration agency for scientific primary data. Although there are many uses of DOIs for primary research data (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.pangaea.de/" data-cite-meta="{}">PANGAEA <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.pangaea.de/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.pangaea.de/?</strong>)</span></a>, earth system research), many systems still use different identifiers.<br />
Research funders and journals working in specific domains should collaborate on standards and best practices for primary research datasets, and journal publishers should encourage or even require linking to research datasets from publications. Successful examples include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" data-cite-meta="{}">GenBank <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/?</strong>)</span></a> (genetic sequences) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html" data-cite-meta="{}">MIAME <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html?</strong>)</span></a> (microarray gene expression).</p>

<p>DOIs have become the standard identifier for electronic scholarly publications and are managed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.crossref.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">CrossRef <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.crossref.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.crossref.org/?</strong>)</span></a> registration agency. Journal articles, databases and websites linking to scholarly publications should use DOIs whenever possible instead of internal identifiers such as the PubMed ID or direct links to publisher webpages. Publishers should implement citation styles that use the DOI instead of volume, issue and page numbers.<br />
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/" data-cite-meta="{}">NLM DTD <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/?</strong>)</span></a> is the standard format used by PubMed Central and many scholarly publishers to produce content for reading in the HTML, PDF or ePub formats. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx" data-cite-meta="{}">Article Authoring Add-in for Microsoft Office Word <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8" data-cite-meta="{}">Lemon8-XML <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8?</strong>)</span></a> allow researchers to produce content in the NLM DTD format.

The information in the author profile may be initially provided by an institution, society or publisher, but should eventually be claimed by the individual researcher because of privacy concerns and because automated author disambiguation is never 100% accurate. Attribution should include all aspects of scholarly activity, including curation of primary research datasets and peer review.<br />
The Public Library of Science (PLoS) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">article-level metrics <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/?</strong>)</span></a> make available comprehensive information (citations, downloads, social bookmarks, comments, etc.) with every published article. This system should be linked to author identifiers and developed into a standard for scholarly resources. Other scholarly publishers and databases for primary research data should then adopt these metrics.</p>
