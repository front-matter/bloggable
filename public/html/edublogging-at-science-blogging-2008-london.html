I haven't seen anybody trying to create formal categories, but I see <em><em>research blogging</em></em>, <em><em>conference blogging</em></em>, <em><em>watercooler blogging</em></em>, <em><em>comic strip blogging</em></em> – and <em><em>edublogging</em></em>. Breakout session 5 of the conference is called <em><em>Science blogs and online forums as teaching tools</em></em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://medinfo.netbib.de/" data-cite-meta="{}">Oliver Obst <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://medinfo.netbib.de/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://medinfo.netbib.de/?</strong>)</span></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/jeffmarlow" data-cite-meta="{}">Jeff Marlow <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/jeffmarlow">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/jeffmarlow?</strong>)</span></a> and myself will try to organize an interesting panel discussion on the topic. Edublogging covers a wide range of topics, as you can guess when looking at these (random) science education blogs:</p>

<p>The last blog is especially interesting. It is hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://edublogs.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Edublogs <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://edublogs.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://edublogs.org/?</strong>)</span></a>. They not only provide a hosting platform for teacher and student blogs, but also offer special features that are especially useful for educational blogging, e.g. managing and aggregating student blogs and sharing material.</p>
<p>My interest in this topic started when we began the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/group/goodpaper" data-cite-meta="{}">Good Paper Journal Club <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/group/goodpaper">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/group/goodpaper?</strong>)</span></a> here on Nature Network. Some questions I would like to address in the session include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are educators (professors, teachers, etc.) using blogs?</li>
<li>How are students using blogs?</li>
<li>How are science libraries using blogs?</li>
<li>Are there special features required for edublogging, e.g. team blogs, restricted access, sharing of documents?</li>
<li>Do university administrators facilitate blogging on education?</li>
</ul>
