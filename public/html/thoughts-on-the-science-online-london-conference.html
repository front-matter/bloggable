<p>As one of the conference organizers I'm obviously biased as to how to judge the success of the conference. But I think that organizing a conference about the online communication of science is as much about how to do things, as it is about finding the right session topics. And as Science Online London is only in its second year (and the sister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonline09.com/" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151026184934/http://www.scienceonline09.com/&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonline09.com/&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2015,10]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Science and Technology - Science and Technology&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">ScienceOnline <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonline09.com/">(<span>“Science and Technology - Science and Technology,”</span> 2015)</span></a> in North Carolina in its third year), there are still a lot of things we can do better.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-liked">What I liked</h3>
<p><em><em>No parallel sessions</em></em><br />
Although we did have two slots with two parallel sessions each, all the other sessions were in the Faraday Theatre. I find that I always miss some great sessions in conferences with many parallel sessions. More importantly this format makes sure that everybody went to the same conference and discusses the same things. I like this because it builds a sense of community around the conference.</p>
<p><em><em>No unconference sessions</em></em><br />
Deciding on the session topics and speakers at the beginning of the conference is a concept that worked well for similar events in the past (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20161203224020/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2016,12]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nature Network&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">SciBarCamp Palo Alto <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">(<span>“Nature Network,”</span> 2016)</span></a>, and in part <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150915074352/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2015,9]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Home : Nature Conferences SciBlog2008&quot;,&quot;title-short&quot;:&quot;Home&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Science Blogging London 2008 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html">(<span>“Home,”</span> 2015)</span></a>). We decided to not use this format, which not only made the day of the conference much less stressful for the organizers, but also allowed us to have invite some interesting speakers that otherwise might not have come. This format also made it easier to have different topics and speakers from last year's conference (only 3 out of the 29 speakers also spoke last year).</p>
<p><em><em>Live streaming of audio and video</em></em><br />
We did stream audio and video of almost all sessions to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/second-life.php" data-cite-meta="{}">Second Life <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/second-life.php">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/second-life.php?</strong>)</span></a>. Exceptions were the session on legal and ethical aspects of blogging (which we decided not to record because of the risk that some statements could be taken as legal advice), and the breakout sessions (where we could only record audio). One speaker (Dave Munger) even gave his presentation through Second Life.</p>
<p>Because the Second Life users could give feedback through Second Life, Twitter or FriendFeed, this was really a virtual conference. Live video streaming (using Second Life or other technologies) should really become the norm for this kind of conference.</p>
<p><em><em>A perfect location</em></em><br />
The Royal Institution was really a perfect place for the conference. You could argue about the pink color of the seats, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000001054" data-cite-meta="{}">Faraday Theatre <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000001054">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000001054?</strong>)</span></a> has just the right size and a great of history of communicating science.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-didn-t-like">What I didn't like</h3>
<p><em><em>Not enough time in the sessions</em></em><br />
We decided to go with 45 minute long sessions, and this turned out to be too short. I would have liked to have a 30 minute discussion in most sessions (some sessions worked well with shorter discussion time, e.g. <em><em>Legal and Ethical Aspects of Science Blogging</em></em>). Although there will always be session that require a different format, next time I would force speakers to limit their introduction to 15 minutes. And I would try to make the sessions 60 minutes long.</p>
<p><em><em>Not enough time between sessions</em></em><br />
The best part of a conference is often the discussions we have between sessions. For this we should have scheduled more time, e.g. by making the coffee breaks 45 minutes long and by having a conference dinner at the beginning of the conference. But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/blog/2009/07/20/announcing-social-events-for-thursday-friday/" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100714054414/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/blog/2009/07/20/announcing-social-events-for-thursday-friday/&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/blog/2009/07/20/announcing-social-events-for-thursday-friday/&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2010,7]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Announcing Social Events For Thursday, Friday  Science Online London Blog&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">social events on Thursday and Friday <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/blog/2009/07/20/announcing-social-events-for-thursday-friday/">(<span>“Announcing Social Events For Thursday, Friday Science Online London Blog,”</span> 2010)</span></a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/08/06/in-which-we-change-venue-fringefrivolous-blogging-unconference-2009" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090906061343/http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/08/06/in-which-we-change-venue-fringefrivolous-blogging-unconference-2009&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/08/06/in-which-we-change-venue-fringefrivolous-blogging-unconference-2009&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2009,9]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;In which we change venue: FringeFrivolous Blogging Unconference 2009 - Mind the Gap - Jennifer Rohn’s blog on Nature Network&quot;,&quot;title-short&quot;:&quot;In which we change venue&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">FringeFrivolous <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog/2009/08/06/in-which-we-change-venue-fringefrivolous-blogging-unconference-2009">(<span>“In Which We Change Venue,”</span> 2009)</span></a> unconference on Friday were not only interesting events, but also great for networking. Doing a conference on a single day is just too short and I would make a repeat conference a two day event. With more time I would also really like to do a brief introduction of every participant (Ã  la <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/scifoo/index.html" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150506103538/http://www.nature.com/scifoo/index.html&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/scifoo/index.html&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2015,5]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Scifoo ’10&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">SciFoo <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/scifoo/index.html">(<span>“Scifoo ’10,”</span> 2015)</span></a>).</p>
<p><em><em>Do more moderation</em></em><br />
Conferences have a tendency of always having the same people saying the same things. And discussions are sometimes more about people saying something that is dear to their heart rather than asking a question or trying to understand the other side. More moderation could help here to make the discussions more unexpected and productive.</p>
