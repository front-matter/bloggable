<p>My post last week about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/18/new-in-plos-one-citation-rates-of-self-selected-vs-mandated-open-access/">citation rates of mandated vs. self-selected Open Access</a> resulted in an interesting discussion thanks to some good arguments made by Stevan Harnad. One personal conclusion for me: mandates for self-archiving are not a good idea. I would very much prefer researchers to be highly motivated to self-archive thanks to a repository that is both fulfilling important functions and is fun to use.</p>

<p>What follows is a short list of ideas – many of them obvious and some of them already implemented – that for me would make repositories more attractive to use.</p>
<h3 id="hosting-of-research-datasets">Hosting of research datasets</h3>
<p>Disciplinary and institutional repositories are good places to make primary research data publicly available. Particularly if no standard database exists, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</a> for genetic sequence data. Whereas everybody nowadays talks about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/~/link.aspx?_id=28A2778937C74EB285F05E38BFBD5DEE&amp;_z=z">making research data available</a>, the threshold to do so is often too high for more specialized datasets. An institutional repository is a good place for simple grassroots solution.</p>
<h3 id="a-disciplinary-repository-for-biomedical-research">A disciplinary repository for biomedical research</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK PubMed Central</a> are very popular disciplinary repositories for the biomedical and life sciences. Unfortunately I can only submit manuscripts to them if the research was funded by one of a few funders (including the NIH, but none of the major German funders).</p>
<h3 id="a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials">A preprint archive for clinical trials</h3>
<p>Deposition of manuscripts prior to peer review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/09/new-on-arxiv-first-report-of-soap-open-access-publishing-project/">has a long tradition</a> in high-energy physics and related disciplines. Preprint archives probably don’t work in all disciplines, but I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">argued before</a> that they could be a very good idea for clinical trials.</p>
<h3 id="journal-publishers-that-allow-self-archiving">Journal publishers that allow self-archiving</h3>
<p>While most publishers allow some form of self-archiving by authors (pre-print, post-print and/or publisher’s PDF version), there are unfortunately still exceptions. The American Chemical Society (ACS) has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://scientopia.org/blogs/bookoftrogool/2010/10/05/acs-the-perfect-storm/">particularly unwelcoming policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="integration-with-the-journal-submission-process">Integration with the journal submission process</h3>
<p>An institutional repository can host pre-prints of submitted papers. But the repository could also enable a tighter integration with the journal submission process. The German <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/https://www.escidoc.org/JSPWiki/en/Overview">eSciDoc</a> project uses that approach. Most researchers would probably welcome technical and financial assistance in the submission process.</p>
<h3 id="integration-with-institutional-bibliography">Integration with institutional bibliography</h3>
<p>The institutional bibliography showcases the scholarly work done by a particular researcher, research group, department or institution. Many researchers like to see up-to-date profiles (including publication lists) on their institutional webpages. Bibliographies are also collected for evaluation purposes. We have started to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.bibapp.org/">BibApp</a> at our institution. Repositories can facilitate fulltext access to PhD theses and other publications in the bibliography.</p>
<h3 id="repositories-that-use-unique-author-identifiers">Repositories that use unique author identifiers</h3>
<p>Regular readers of this blog know about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">my involvement</a> in the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative. All scholarly contributions, including repository content, should be unambiguously connected to their creators as this will greatly facilitate the discovery process. I look forward to ORCID support in repository software such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.eprints.org/">EPrints</a>.</p>
