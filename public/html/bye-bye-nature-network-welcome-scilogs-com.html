<p>The science blogging network Nature Network is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022002312/http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2012/07/26/a-new-era-for-the-nature-network-blogs">moving to a new home</a>. Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022002312/http://www.scilogs.com/">SciLogs.com</a> launched as new home for Nature Network bloggers. I have been blogging at Nature Network for three years, starting with my first blog post (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022002312/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2007/08/03/open_access_may_become_mandatory_for_nih_funded_research/">Open access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research</a>) almost exactly 5 years ago to the day. My blog moved to PLOS BLOGS in September 2010 and all my old Nature Network content can be found here at PLOS BLOGS.</p>
<p>Blogging at Nature Network has changed my life in many ways. Thank you Matt and Corie (and later Lou) to make this possible.</p>
