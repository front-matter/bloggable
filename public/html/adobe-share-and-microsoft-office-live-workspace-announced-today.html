<p>Both Adobe and Microsoft today announced free web-based solutions for document sharing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://share.adobe.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Adobe Share <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://share.adobe.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://share.adobe.com/?</strong>)</span></a> uses the Flash technology to display various document formats. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/163539601/adobe_share_document_widget.html" data-cite-meta="{}">Tim O'Reilly <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/163539601/adobe_share_document_widget.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/163539601/adobe_share_document_widget.html?</strong>)</span></a> has a nice writeup of the new service.</p>

<p>Why should a scientist care about all this? Because these are excellent tools to share your presentations and to collaborate on manuscripts you are writing. No more emailing Powerpoint, Excel, Word or PDF files back and forth. And with several major players (Microsoft, Google, Adobe and the smaller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://www.zoho.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Zoho <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://www.zoho.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://www.zoho.com/?</strong>)</span></a>) offering web-based document sharing, this will soon become as commonplace as web-based email.</p>
