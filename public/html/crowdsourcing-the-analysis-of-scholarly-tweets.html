<p>In December Euan Adie and I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/" data-cite-meta="{}">started the CrowdoMeter projec <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/?</strong>)</span></a>t, an analysis of the semantic content of tweets linking to scholarly papers. Because classifying almost 500 tweets is a lot of work, we turned this into a crowdsourcing project. We got help from 36 people, who did 953 classifications, and we discussed the preliminary results (available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://crowdometer.org/ratings" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://crowdometer.org/ratings?</strong>)</span></a>) at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://scienceonline2012.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">ScienceOnline2012 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://scienceonline2012.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://scienceonline2012.com/?</strong>)</span></a> conference.</p>

<p>The figure doesn’t look all that exciting, but there is some calculation involved. There are different numbers of classifications per tweet and sometimes there is disagreement: true means at least 50% of classifications were true. It would be great if we find people willing to help with data analysis, preferably using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://rstudio.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">R <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://rstudio.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://rstudio.org/?</strong>)</span></a> and contributing their scripts to the Github repository.
