<p>Version 2.1 of the reference manager Zotero was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122458/http://www.zotero.org/blog/new-release-zotero-2-1/">released last Friday</a>. The biggest change for me is the support of Citation Style Language (CSL) 1.0. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122458/http://citationstyles.org/">CSL</a> is an open XML-based standard for citations and bibliographies. Older versions of Zotero used CSL 0.8.1, but the improved CSL 1.0 was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122458/http://citationstyles.org/2011/03/18/csl-1-0-first-anniversary/">released</a> a year ago.</p>
<p>With Zotero 2.1, Papers 2 (both released in March) and Mendeley we now have three major reference managers supporting the current version of CSL. Which reference manager will be the next one? And why arenâ€™t more journals providing downloadable citation styles in CSL format in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122458/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">author guidelines</a>?</p>
