<p>Authoring of scholarly articles is a recurring theme in this blog
since it started in 2008. Authoring is still in desperate need for
improvement, and nobody has convincingly figured out how to solve this
problem. Authoring involves several steps, and it helps to think about
them separately:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Writing</bold></bold>. Manuscript writing, including
    formatting, collaborative authoring</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Submission</bold></bold>. Formatting a manuscript
    according to a publisher’s author guidelines, and handing it over to
    a publishing platform</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Revision</bold></bold>. Changes made to a manuscript
    in the peer review process, or after publication</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Although authoring typically involves text, similar issues arise for
other research outputs, e.g research data. And these considerations are
also relevant for other forms of publishing, whether it is
self-publication on a blog or website, or publishing of preprints and
white papers.</p>

<p>For me the main challenge in authoring is to go from human-readable
unstructured content to highly structured machine-readable content. We
could make authoring simpler by either forgoing any structure and just
publishing in any format we want, or we can force authors to structure
their manuscripts according to a very specific set of rules. The former
doesn’t seem to be an option, not only do we have a set of community
standards that have evolved for a very long time (research articles for
example have title, authors, results, references, etc.), but it also
makes it hard to find and reuse scholarly research by others.</p>
<p>The latter option is also not really viable since most researchers
haven’t learned to produce their research outputs in machine-readable
highly standardized formats. There are some exceptions, e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</ext-link>
and other reporting standards in clinical medicine or the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/23/brian-mcmahon-publishing-semantic-crystallography-every-science-data-publisher-should-watch-this-all-the-way-through/">semantic
publishing in Crystallography</ext-link>, but for the most part research
outputs are too diverse to easily find a format that works for all of
them. The current trend is certainly towards machine-readable rather
than towards human-readable, but there is still a significant gap -
scholarly articles are transformed from documents in Microsoft Word (or
sometimes LaTeX) format into XML (for most biomedical research that
means
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">JATS</ext-link>)
using kludgy tools and lots of manual labor.</p>
<p>What solutions have been tried to overcome the limitations of our
current authoring tools, and to make the process more enjoyable for
authors and more productive for publishers?</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Do the conversion manually, still a common workflow.</p>
  </list-item>

    <p>Tools for publishers such as

    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shabash.net/merops/">Merops</ext-link>
    - both commercial - or the evolving Open Source
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/mpach/modules">mPach</ext-link>
    that convert Microsoft Word documents into JATS XML and do a lot of
    automated checks along the way.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Tools for authors that directly generate JATS XML, either as a
    Microsoft Word plugin (the

    (e.g.

    as Wordpress
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annotum.org/">Annotum</ext-link>).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Forget about XML and use HTML5 has the canonical file format,
    e.g. as
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/">Scholarly
    HTML</ext-link> or HTML5 specifications such as
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/blob/master/specification.asciidoc">HTMLBook</ext-link>.
    Please read Molly Sharp’s
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/structured-documents-for-science-jats-xml-as-canonical-content-format/">blog

    alternative to XML.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Use file formats for authoring that are a better fit for the
    requirements of scholarly authors, in particular

  <list-item>
    <p>Build online editors for scientific content that hide the
    underlying file format, and guide users towards a structured format,
    e.g. by not allowing input that doesn’t conform to
    specifications.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p><bold><bold>Solution 1.</bold></bold> isn’t really an option, as it
makes scholarly publishing unnecessarily slow and expensive. Typesetter
Kaveh Bazergan has gone on record at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-a-global-conference/">SpotOn
London Conference 2012</ext-link> by saying that the current process is
insane and that he wants to be “put out of business”.</p>
<p><bold><bold>Solution 2.</bold></bold> is probably the most commonly
used workflow used by larger publishers today, but is very much centered
around a Microsoft Word to XML workflow. LaTeX is a popular authoring
environment in some disciplines, but still requires work to convert
documents into web-friendly formats such as HTML and XML.</p>
<p><bold><bold>Solutions 3. to 5.</bold></bold> have never picked up any
significant traction. Overall the progress in this area has been modest
at best, and the mainstream of authoring today isn’t too different from
20 years ago. Although I have gone on record for saying that
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/tags.html#markdown-ref">Scholarly
Markdown</ext-link> has a lot of potential, the problem is much bigger
than finding a single file format, and markdown will never be the
solution for all authoring needs.</p>
<p><bold><bold>Solution 6.</bold></bold> is an area where a lot of
exciting development is currently happening, examples include
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.writelatex.com/">WriteLateX</ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</ext-link>.
Although the future of scholarly authoring will certainly include online
authoring tools (making it much easier to collaborate, one of the
authoring pain points), we run the risk of locking in users into one
particular authoring environment.</p>
<sec id="going-forward">
  <title>Going Forward</title>
  <p>How can we move forward? I would suggest the following:</p>
  <p>Publishers should accept manuscripts in any reasonable file format,
  which means at least Microsoft Word, Open Office, LaTeX, Markdown,
  HTML and PDF, but possibly more. This will create a lot of extra work
  for publishers, but will open the doors for innovation, both in the
  academic and commercial sector. We will never see significant progress
  in scholarly authoring tools if the submission step requires
  manuscripts to be in a single file format (Microsoft Word) - in
  particular since this file format is a general purpose word
  processsing format and not something designed specifically for
  scholarly content. And we want researchers to spend their time doing
  research and writing up their research, not formatting documents.</p>
  <p>To handle this avalanche of unstructured documents, publishers need
  conversion tools that can transform all these documents into a format
  that can feed into their editorial and publishing workflows. A limited
  number of these tools exist already, but this will require a
  significant development effort. Again, opening up submissions to a</p>
