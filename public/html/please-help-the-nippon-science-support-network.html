<p>The recent tragic events in Japan have made it difficult or impossible for many Japanese scientists to continue their work. The newly launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://nipponsciencesupport.net/" data-cite-meta="{}">Nippon Science Support Network <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://nipponsciencesupport.net/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://nipponsciencesupport.net/?</strong>)</span></a> has therefore established a database of positions and stipends in other countries for Japanese students, research fellows and scientific personnel. The network has started as a cooperation between German and Japanese researchers, but because of overwhelming demand today turned into a global initiative, allowing researchers from all countries help to support Japanese scientists.</p>
<p>Behind this initiative are a lot of people, but most importantly Phil Selenko – a group leader from the Leibniz Institute of Molecular Pharmacology in Berlin. Longtime readers of this blog will remember that Phil helped organize a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/05/24/why-local-hubs-in-nature-network-are-important" data-cite-meta="{}">great effort in 2008 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/05/24/why-local-hubs-in-nature-network-are-important">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120610130607/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/05/24/why-local-hubs-in-nature-network-are-important?</strong>)</span></a> to bring Nobel Laureates and other senior scientists together with graduate students, and <em><em>to give them the same kind of networking opportunities that are usually restricted to seasoned faculty (and often happens behind closed doors).</em></em> I wish him the best of luck with this initiative.</p>
