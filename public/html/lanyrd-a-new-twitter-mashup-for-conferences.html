It integrates with Twitter to allow you to list conferences you are organizing, speaking at, attending, or just following. It is a social directory in the sense that everyone can edit this information (I don’t know who started the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/science-online-london/" data-cite-meta="{}">Science Online London 2010 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/science-online-london/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/science-online-london/?</strong>)</span></a> page), and that you can see the conferences of your Twitter contacts. Future versions of Lanyrd will do a lot more (you can see some of the upcoming features at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/dconstruct/" data-cite-meta="{}">dConstruct 2010 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/dconstruct/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/2010/dconstruct/?</strong>)</span></a> page), but the site is already useful and just looks gorgeous.</p>

<p>The Lanyrd blog launched yesterday and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/blog/2010/welcome/" data-cite-meta="{}">the first post <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/blog/2010/welcome/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://lanyrd.com/blog/2010/welcome/?</strong>)</span></a> contains some interesting background information. Lanyrd is a joint project by web developers and newly-weds Simon Willison and Natalie Downe. They launched Lanyrd from Morocco while on an extended honeymoon and don’t plan to be back to England before the end of next year.</p>
<p>Sites such as <strong><strong>Eventbrite</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>Upcoming</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>Slideshare</strong></strong> have been around for a while. Twitter is becoming an increasingly useful tool for conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/12/lanyrd-a-new-twitter-mashup-for-conferences/The%20Great%20Science%20Online%20London%20Tweetup" data-cite-meta="{}">The Great Science Online London Tweetup <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/12/lanyrd-a-new-twitter-mashup-for-conferences/The%20Great%20Science%20Online%20London%20Tweetup">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041249/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/12/lanyrd-a-new-twitter-mashup-for-conferences/The%20Great%20Science%20Online%20London%20Tweetup?</strong>)</span></a>). And Lanyrd is one of the nicest examples that I have seen so far that integrates Twitter into a service targeted at conference attendees.</p>
