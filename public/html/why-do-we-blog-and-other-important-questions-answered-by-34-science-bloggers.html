<p>What started out as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/groups/nnbloggername/forum/topics/3392">a few questions to science bloggers</a> in the <em><em>Nature Network Bloggers Forum</em></em>, has turned into a collection of more than 30 blog posts not limited to <em><em>Nature Network</em></em> (big thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/the_science_blog_meme.php">Bora</a> and others for spreading the word). The following science bloggers answered a set of 10 questions about their blogging (roughly in chronological order):</p>

<p><em><em>Please contact me if I missed a blog post.</em></em></p>
<p>Reading these blog posts is not only interesting and entertaining, but probably also a very good introduction to the current state of science blogging. Below is a personal summary of some of the answers. Oh, the best title was probably from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/U81B5C465/blog/2008/11/16/la-meme-chose">Frank Norman</a>: <em><em>La meme chose</em></em>.</p>
<h3 id="1-what-is-your-blog-about">1. What is your blog about?</h3>
<p>Most bloggers seem to write about many different science-related topics. And only a minority about the actual science they are doing. Some bloggers gave more specific answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>My blog is about science, in particular evolution and genomes.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important.html">T. Ryan Gregory</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>It</em>'<em>s a sort of a window of transparency over a weird scientific environment, the Italian science jobs and funding market.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/massimopinto/blog/2008/11/15/whats-this-bel-paese">Massimo Pinto</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>Basically the philosophical implications of science.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2008/11/another_goldang_meme.php">John Wilkins</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>Anything releted to Biotechnology in Frederick County, MD.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://fredcobio.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/scientistist-their-desks">Jim Hardy</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>The general theme is how we can bring the worlds of information technology and the life sciences together.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://mndoci.com/blog/2008/11/16/why-do-we-blog/">Deepak Singh</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>I am trying to put the people behind the science into the spotlight: the technicians, operational support, science management and others.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/stuffysour/blog/2008/11/14/its-the-need-to-communicate">Steffi Suhr</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>We write about making sense of medicine and medical science in museums.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://www.corporeality.net/museion/2008/11/17/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important-questions-reply-to-martin-fenner-nature-networks/">Thomas Soderqvist</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>Ostensibly about theoretical population biology.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/mike/blog/2008/11/18/follow-those-lemmings-where">Mike Fowler</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>I am interested in how the internet is changing the way we publish and communicate science.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/14/some-answers-for-henry-gee">me</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-what-will-you-never-write-about">2. What will you never write about?</h3>
<p>Several people mentioned that they would not give out personal information about other people, or comment directly on what's going on in their institution/company. Most people also avoid to talk religious beliefs or politics. Confidential information, including unreleased papers, was mentioned several times. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog/2008/03/05/the-release-of-calcium-from-intracellular-stores-and-other-stuff">release of calcium from intracellular stores</a> is another topic that several people would never blog about. Also:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>Only write about things I actually understand.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/11/why_blog_the_meme_returns.php">Ed Yong</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>I will never ask anyone to give me money via this blog.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://petrona.typepad.com/petrona/2008/11/pinning-ones-hamster-to-the-mast.html">Maxine Clarke</a>)</li>
<li><em><em>I hope that I will not have to write blog posts that are evaluated, measured and put on a resumé.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/14/some-answers-for-henry-gee">me</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-have-you-ever-considered-leaving-science">3. Have you ever considered leaving science?</h3>
<p>Several people said something similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/the_science_blog_meme.php">Bora Zivkovic</a>: <em><em>Leaving research – yes, I already did that. Leaving science – never.</em></em></p>
<h3 id="4-what-would-you-do-instead">4. What would you do instead?</h3>
<p>Some interesting answers. And a science background would be helpful in most of the jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>Zookeeper, or an animal trainer in a circus</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/06/how_to_become_a_biologist.php">Bora Zivkovic</a>)</li>

<h3 id="5-what-do-you-think-will-science-blogging-be-like-in-5-years">5. What do you think will science blogging be like in 5 years?</h3>
<p>This was a difficult question that some didn't answer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important.html">Larry Moran</a> said: <em><em>pretty much the same as it is now.</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important.html">T. Ryan Gregory</a> thinks that <em><em>more professional researchers will join the blogosphere as this becomes socially acceptable.</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://blog.pansapiens.com/2008/11/17/that-science-blog-meme-thing-going-around/">Andrew Perry</a> thinks that <em><em>research groups will be tied together more and more by their blogs.</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/U27CE62BB/blog/2008/11/14/blog-survey">Eva Amsen</a> thinks that <em><em>there will be so many science blogs that we have to specialize.</em></em> And I wrote that <em><em>some science bloggers will be able to make enough money to earn a living from it.</em></em></p>

But I hadn</em>'<em>t expected to get so many interesting contacts with colleagues around the world.</em></em> Many people (including myself) had similar answers. Going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://www.nature.com/nature/meetings/scifoo/index.html">SciFoo</a> is certainly an extraordinary thing an SciFoo invitation was mentioned by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-do-we-blog.html">Pedro Beltrao</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://fredcobio.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/scientistist-their-desks">Jim Hardy</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://duncan.hull.name/2008/11/17/science-blog-meme-why-do-we-blog/">Duncan Hull</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://mndoci.com/blog/2008/11/16/why-do-we-blog/">Deepak Singh</a>. Some other answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><em>The Editor-in-Chief of Nature once told David Attenborough that he should read my blog.</em></em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/11/why_blog_the_meme_returns.php">Ed Yong</a>)</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="7-did-you-write-a-blog-post-or-comment-you-later-regretted">7. Did you write a blog post or comment you later regretted?</h3>
<p>For most people that was not a big issue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/11/why_blog_the_meme_returns.php">Ed Yong</a> regrets to have written nice things about studies that later turned out to be rubbish not so good.</p>
<h3 id="8-when-did-you-first-learn-about-science-blogging">8. When did you first learn about science blogging?</h3>
<p>Many different answers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://www.nodalpoint.org/">Nodalpoint</a> was mentioned by several bloggers, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://duncan.hull.name/2008/11/17/science-blog-meme-why-do-we-blog/">Duncan Hull</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://blindscientist.genedrift.org/2008/11/16/the-science-blog-meme/">Paolo Nuin</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-do-we-blog.html">Pedro Beltrao</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important.html">T. Ryan Gregory</a> was introduced to science blogging by his graduate student. The most hilarious answer is from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog/2008/11/14/that-martin-fenner-effect">Henry Gee</a> and involves a garage, an old washing-machine motor and heavier-than-air flight.</p>
<h3 id="9-what-do-your-colleagues-at-work-say-about-your-blogging">9. What do your colleagues at work say about your blogging?</h3>
<p>The standard answer seems to be that most of them don't know or don't care. I would hope that in the future we will have more answers like the one from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003123037/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/the_science_blog_meme.php">Bora Zivkovic</a>: <em><em>That's what they are paying me for and I hope they are happy.</em></em></p>
<h3 id="10-how-the-heck-do-you-have-time-to-blog-and-do-research-at-the-same-time">10. How the heck do you have time to blog and do research at the same time?</h3>
