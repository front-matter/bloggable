I am helping organize this conference since 2009, and I again look forward to the sessions, and - more importantly - the discussions with people in and between sessions this year.</p>
<p>The name (ScienceBlogging London, ScienceOnline London, SpotOn London), the location (Royal Institution, British Library, Wellcome Conference Center), the people organizing (too many to mention, but Nature Publishing Group always at the core), and the fringe events (lots of cool things from <a href="http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-life/science-blogging-2008-part-i/" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://blog.mendeley.com/2008/09/09/science-blogging-2008-part-i/&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;My jetlag is in full swing as I’m writing this from my room at the lovely Walper Terrace Hotel in Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario.

The biggest change is obviously that <a href="https://twitter.com/louwoodley" data-cite-meta="{}">Lou Woodley <span class="citation" data-cites="https://twitter.com/louwoodley">(<strong>https://twitter.com/louwoodley?</strong>)</span></a> is no longer an organizer (as she announced at last year’s conference), but this is also the first SpotOn conference with a theme:</p>
<blockquote>
The challenges of balancing the public and the private in the digital age
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously a very broad topic, but nicely encompasses many important issues that we are dealing with in scholarly communication today. The draft program is posted <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/13/spoton-london-2014-draft-programme" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/13/spoton-london-2014-draft-programme">(<strong>http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/13/spoton-london-2014-draft-programme?</strong>)</span></a>, and I’m helping organize the sessions on <strong><strong>sharing sensitive data</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>open peer review</strong></strong>. More details will follow for all these sessions.</p>
<p>The second day of the conference will be in unconference (or barcamp) format and the program drafted by the delegates in the morning. This format is popular in the science communications community (I first heard about the project that became my current job at <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/" data-cite-meta="{}">SciBarCamp in 2009 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">(<strong>https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/?</strong>)</span></a>), and SpotOn London has used this format in the first conference in 2008 (and again in 2009):</p>

<p>For people not familiar with this format the idea of a conference (day) without predetermined topics or speakers sounds scary. As it turns out, the problem is usually not the lack of ideas or people wanting to talk, but rather how to coordinate this in a way that everyone who wants to get involved can do so, and it doesn’t become a discussion among those with the loudest voices (and biggest egos). My experience with SpotOn London and other conferences I enjoyed is that the best sessions are usually those that allow for a good discussion, and not those with the most polished PowerPoint slides. Some suggestions for when you attend an unconference for the first time:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to sessions with topics you know little about, but want to learn more</li>
<li>when suggesting a session, do this together with others</li>
<li>suggest topics that are focussed and unusual, not the obvious ones we always talk about</li>
<li>don’t even think about doing a PowerPoint presentation</li>
<li>when moderating a session, be a good moderator, not a good speaker</li>
</ul>

The event is based on the spirit and format of Foo Camp, an unconference focused on emerging technology, and is designed to encourage collaboration between scientists who would not typically work together. As such, it is particularly unusual among scientific conferences in three ways; it is invitation-only, the invitees come from many different areas of science rather than one subject (such as physics, chemistry or biology), and the meeting has no fixed agenda; the invited scientists, technologists and policy makers set the conference program during the conference itself, based on their shared professional interests and enthusiasms. The first event in 2006 was held under the Chatham House Rule. The policy at the second event was to allow open reporting by default; attendees were expected to indicate if their comments were off the record. Science Foo Camp has taken place annually at the Googleplex campus in Mountain View, California, United States. It is currently organized by Tim O’Reilly of O’Reilly Media, Daniel Hook of Digital Science and Cat Allman of Google. A twelve-minute YouTube video made at SciFoo 2009 is available.&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Wikipedia&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,1]]},&quot;note&quot;:&quot;Page Version ID: 998544140&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Science Foo Camp&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Wikipedia: SciFoo <span class="citation" data-cites="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp">(<span>“Science Foo Camp,”</span> 2021)</span></a></li>
