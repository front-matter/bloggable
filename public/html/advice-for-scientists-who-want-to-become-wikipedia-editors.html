<p>This week <em><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></em> published another helpful editorial in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090759/http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pcol.v03.i01">10 Simple Rules</a> collection (Logan 2010): <em>Ten Simple Rules for Editing Wikipedia.</em></p>
<p>I have very rarely edited Wikipedia articles myself, and I suspect this behavior is the rule and not the exception among science bloggers. And this always puzzled me, as editing Wikipedia articles should be a natural thing to do for those familiar with blogs and other online tools.</p>
<p>The editorial not only gives good advice for the beginning Wikipedia editor, there are many other places where you can also find this information. But the editorial is written with the scientist as Wikipedia editor in mind and clarifies some of the issues that can arise.</p>
