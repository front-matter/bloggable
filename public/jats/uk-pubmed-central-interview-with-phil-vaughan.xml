Central</ext-link> was launched in February 2000 by the U.S. National
Institutes of Health (NIH) as a free digital archive of journal
articles. Just as PubMed, PubMed Central covers research in the life
sciences, but not other areas of research, e.g. engineering, physical
sciences or astronomy.</p>
<p>Some journal articles are available as full text as soon as they are
published, and most journals provide free access to full text articles
within a year of publication. Some journals only provide the full text
of some articles, including research funded by the NIH under the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">NIH
Public Access Policy</ext-link>. The majority of fulltext articles in
PubMed Central are not Open Access, but are protected by copyright.
These articles are often made available under a license that allows
redistribution and reuse.</p>
<p>All articles are deposited using the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM-DTD</ext-link>
XML format, which is a standard text format suitable for text mining and
long-term archiving. Most articles are deposited directly by the
journals, so that authors do not have to get involved in the technical
aspects of article deposition.</p>
<p>PubMed Central is a centralized archive of full text papers and not
simply an interface to search these articles at the websites of the
participating journals. Neither is PubMed Central an interface to search
the various institutional repositories at universities and institutions.
The NIH thinks that this centralized approach makes it easier to develop
additional functionality, including the integration with other databases
(e.g. the protein or nucleotide databases) hosted at the NIH.</p>
<p>UK PubMed Central was launched in 2007 as the first PubMed Central
outside the United States

launched this week). In January 2010 UK PubMed Central will launch a
number of new services, and I used the opportunity to ask UK PubMed
Central Programme Manager Philip Vaughan a few questions.</p>

  PubMed Central</ext-link> offers free access to 1.6 million full text
  journal articles in the fields of Life Sciences, Biomedicine and
  Health. Our content is free to read, print off and download. There is
  no registration process required: users can simply visit our site and
  start searching!It has been developed in consultation with the UK
  biomedical and health research community, and is about to launch some
  exciting new services in January 2010. Usage of our service has been
  growing steadily; we average 300,000 downloads a month currently.</p>

  <title>2. Why do we need more than one PubMed Central, and how are

  <p>UKPMC gives the UK research community access to all the content of
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PMC</ext-link>,
  but with added value specifically for the UK. For example, it offers
  Grant Reporting features, whereby users can search for current grants
  from all of our 8 Funders, can link the publications they produce to
  the grants they originated from, and view the impact of their work
  through access to citations. UK researchers can also
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110953/https://ukmss.mimas.ac.uk/ukmss">deposit
  their manuscripts directly</ext-link> into UKPMC.We will also be
  accessing additional content not in PMC; around 475,000 extra
  articles, reviews, guidelines and theses. Through the involvement of
  our funders, we are capturing around 90% of recently published journal
  articles from biomedical research conducted in the UK.We are therefore
  increasing the visibility of UK research in the field.</p>
  <p>Our colleagues at NCBI in the US have been very supportive of our
  activities: they have been keen for the PMC “project” to expand beyond
  the US. A Canadian version

  <title>3. Why does a search use PubMed Central and not the UK
  version?</title>
  <p>The current UKPMC site searches PMC as it “mirrors” its content.
  But this about to change; from January UKPMC will be a “stand alone”
  service with its own up to date archive of content, as well as access
  to all the content of PubMed and PubMed Central.</p>

  <title>4. What is the relationship between UK PubMed Central and
  institutional repositories?</title>
  <p>UKPMC is a subject repository and as such receives content from
  researchers at Higher Education institutions across the UK. Deposition
  in UKPMC is mandatory if a researcher has a grant from any of our 8
  Funders:

  content from other repositories. However, institutional repositories
  are welcome to harvest our content; we have an OAI-PMH interface to
  enable this. On the other hand, there are no plans to develop of
  institutional repositories from within UK PubMed Central.</p>

<sec id="5-what-is-the-material-that-can-t-be-put-into-uk-pubmed-central">
  <title>5. What is the material that can't be put into UK PubMed
  Central?</title>
  <p>If the material is not peer-reviewed research published in a
  recognized journal by a known publisher, it would not be deposited
  into UK PubMed Central. One aspect of our development programme has
  been to identify what further content we could provide links to, for
  example published research theses and NHS clinical guidelines. But, we
  have rigid quality control procedures in place even to provide links
  to material. That said, we do remain open minded, in terms of what
  material we may consider linking to in the future. And who knows what
  might arise in the future. For example, there does seem to be an
  appetite to include images.</p>

  <title>6. Can I submit my accepted manuscript if it was not funded by

  <p>Unfortunately not at this time. We are hopeful that other UK
  research councils and funders of life sciences research will come on
  board in due course. The more funders that come on board, the stronger
  our service will become and the stronger our message on the importance
  of OA.</p>
