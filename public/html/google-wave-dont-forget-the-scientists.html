Google Wave is not only a product, but also an open protocol that anyone can use to build his own wave server.</p>
<p>Google Wave is already very interesting by itself, but can also be extended further:</p>
<ul>
<li>by <em><em>robots</em></em> that automate common tasks and run on the server, and</li>
<li>by <em><em>gadgets</em></em> that allow new ways of user interactions and run on the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds all rather geeky, but why should a scientist care about <em><em>Google Wave</em></em>? Part of the job of every scientist is to communicate and collaborate, and email is by far the most widely used tool to do that. Email has many shortcomings, some of which can be overcome by blogs, wikis, and a constantly growing number of other Web 2.0 tools from Twitter to FriendFeed. But Google Wave goes one step further. The basic idea of a wave is a document (and this can be everything from text to pictures) combined with the discussion about that document, and that is a very natural design for many scientific communications.</p>
<p>Google Wave will be publicly available later this year. I hope that by that time it will also have the first extensions designed specifically for scientists, e.g. for</p>
