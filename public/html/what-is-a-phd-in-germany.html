<p>Nature News this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090323/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080312/full/452138a.html">reports</a> that</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This extremely embarrassing story is fortunately no longer possible. The German Kultusministerkonferenz decided on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090323/http://www.kmk.org/aktuell/pm080306c.htm">March 6</a> (text in German) to allow U.S. PhDs to call themselves Dr. in Germany. Until this story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090323/http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/03/07/who-are-you-calling-doctor/">evolved</a>, I didn't even know that this is an issue.</p>
