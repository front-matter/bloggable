<p>The U.S. senate yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152845/http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm">passed</a> the FY2008 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Bill. The bill includes provisions that make public access of all papers from NIH-funded research mandatory. Peter Suber <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152845/http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2007/10/oa-mandate-at-nih-passes-senate.html">reports</a> that last-minute amendments to weaken these provisions were not included (the official U.S.Senate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152845/http://www.senate.gov/">website</a> hasn't been updated yet to include that information). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152845/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research">House of Representatives</a> passed this bill in July, and we now have to wait for the likely presidential veto.<br />
