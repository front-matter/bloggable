<p>Yesterday PLOS Biology published an essay by me: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">What Can Article Level Metrics Do for You?</a> (Fenner, 2013). I had help from many others in writing the essay, in particular PLOS Biology editor Emma Ganley. I hope that the essay can help researchers get introduced to article-level metrics, and I am honored that the essay is part of the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001688">PLOS Biology 10th anniversary collection</a>.</p>
<p>The essay is an Open Access article published under a CC-BY license, so not only can everyone read it, but the text and figures can be freely reused, as long as proper attribution is provided, e.g. Fig. 5:</p>

<p>Although this is an essay and not a research article, Iâ€™ve added the data and R scripts used to generate the figures (1, 3-5) as <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.s001">supporting information</a>. As I <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/10/20/the-complete-article/">have said earlier</a>, I think it is important that an article contains more than the text. With the open source software <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> or <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> everyone can recreate the figures, and can look at the data underlying the figures in the essay. One can for example look into the data behind Fig. 5 to better understand how articles with F1000Prime recommendations <strong><strong>and</strong></strong> Wikipedia mentions differ from those <strong><strong>only</strong></strong> recommended in F1000Prime. Feel free to ask for help getting started in the comments.</p>
<p>Incidentally this is also my first PLOS article (my wife is way ahead of me with 5 research articles), so that I can finally look at PLOS article-level metrics as an author - after being the technical lead for this project since May 2012.</p>
