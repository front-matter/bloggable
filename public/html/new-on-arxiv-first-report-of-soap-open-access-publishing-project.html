<p>Practically all papers in high-energy physics (&gt; 90% since the late 1990s) are first published on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> preprint server. Several related disciplines also have a long ArXiv tradition. But ArXiv is also an excellent source of interesting papers about scientific publishing, including this one from last Monday:</p>
<p><strong><strong>Dallmeier-Tiessen S, Darby R, Goerner B, Hyppoelae J, Igo-Kemenes P, Kahn D, et al.</strong></strong> First results of the SOAP project. Open access publishing in 2010. 2010 Oct; Available from: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0506">http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0506</a>.</p>
<p>The paper is a comprehensive report on the current state of open access publishing â€“ and deserves a separate blog post. <strong><strong>Salvatore Mele</strong></strong> (one of the coauthors) pointed me to this paper in a very interesting dinner conversation last night. Follow the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://www.citeulike.org/group/13987/library">Gobbledygook reading list</a> for more interesting ArXiv papers, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5418">gem</a> from 2009 on the citation behavior in high-energy physics.</p>
