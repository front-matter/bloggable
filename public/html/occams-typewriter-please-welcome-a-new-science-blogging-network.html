<p>Last Friday the latest science blogging network officially launched: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://occamstypewriter.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Occam’s Typewriter <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://occamstypewriter.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://occamstypewriter.org/?</strong>)</span></a>.

Most of the bloggers have moved their blog from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://network.nature.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Nature Network <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://network.nature.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://network.nature.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, where I wrote next to them from 2007 until September this year.</p>
