<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.academicproductivity.com/2010/readermeter-crowdsourcing-research-impact/" data-cite-meta="{}">blog post last week <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.academicproductivity.com/2010/readermeter-crowdsourcing-research-impact/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.academicproductivity.com/2010/readermeter-crowdsourcing-research-impact/?</strong>)</span></a>, Dario Taraborelli officially announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://readermeter.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ReaderMeter <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://readermeter.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://readermeter.org/?</strong>)</span></a>. ReaderMeter takes the usage data from reference managers (starting with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.mendeley.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Mendeley <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.mendeley.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.mendeley.com/?</strong>)</span></a>) to analyze the impact of publications by a particular author.</p>
<p>ReaderMeter is a welcome addition to other metrics of researcher impact, most of which are citation-based. And ReaderMeter was hacked together in a few nights, so the service should improve over time. Dario mentions some of the current limitations in his blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Usage data only from Mendeley</strong></strong>. We don’t know whether the reading patterns of users from other reference managers (e.g. CiteULike, Zotero, Endnote Web and Refworks) differ. Dario is working on adding more services.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Author disambiguation</strong></strong>. This is a critical component, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/" data-cite-meta="{}">ORCID <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/?</strong>)</span></a> initiative is probably the best tool to overcome this limitation, especially when data from several reference managers have to be integrated.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Article disambiguation</strong></strong>. Multiple copies of the same reference are common in reference manager databases. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://dx.doi.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">DOI <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://dx.doi.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://dx.doi.org/?</strong>)</span></a> can solve this problem for those publications that have a DOI, but consequent use of the DOI by journals, citation databases and reference managers has yet to become standard practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>ReaderMeter is visually pleasing and fun to use. And the data are also provided in JSON format, which allows integration into other web pages, e.g. the researcher’s home page.</p>
