<p>Last week the German Max Planck Society (MPG) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152549/http://www.mpg.de/english/illustrationsDocumentation/documentation/pressReleases/2007/pressRelease20071022/index.html">cancelled</a> their licensing agreement with Springer. Starting January 1st, MPG scientists no longer have access to the 1200 Springer journals through the <em><em>SpringerLink</em></em> interface.</p>
<p>This is an important announcement, because the MPG is one of the largest research organizations in Germany and Springer the second largest STM (Science, Technology, Medicine) publisher after Elsevier. Just a few weeks before this announcement, both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152549/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/09/27/howard-hughes-medical-institute-pays-for-open-access-in-springer-journals">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152549/http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_2/oa_journals/springer.html.en">University of GÃ¶ttingen</a> announced that they will pay their authors for Open Access in Springer journals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152549/http://www.springer.com/dal/home/open+choice">Springer Open Choice</a>).</p>
<p>Time will tell whether these announcements are coincidences or the part of a larger trend from a <em><em>subscriber-pays</em></em> to an <em><em>author-pays</em></em> model.</p>
