<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/">I posted a document</a> that should help define a set of principles for scientific attribution. These principles will be presented and discussed at the National Science Foundation workshop <strong><strong>Changing the Conduct of Science in the Information Age</strong></strong> on November 12. Many people helped me with this document (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://cameronneylon.net/">Cameron Neylon</a> in particular), and I welcome comments and suggestions.</p>
