is a community effort to standardize researcher identification. The
initiative was first announced last December, and is supported by a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.orcid.org/gallery.php">growing
number</ext-link> of publishers, scholarly societies and academic
institutions.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/">Thomson
Reuters</ext-link> is not only one of the founding members of the
initiative, but will also provide the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</ext-link>
technology as a starting point for building the
<italic><italic>ORCID</italic></italic> platform.</p>
<p>I asked <italic><italic>Renny Guida</italic></italic> from Thomson
Reuters a few questions about his thoughts on unique author identifiers
in general, and <italic><italic>ResearcherID</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>ORCID</italic></italic> in particular.</p>

  <title>1. What is ResearcherID?</title>
  <p><italic><italic>ResearcherID</italic></italic> is a freely
  available system that helps the research community overcome the issues
  of individual name ambiguity and attribution. The system is available
  to everyone and allows a researcher to establish, maintain and control
  a biographic and bibliographic profile.</p>
  <fig>
    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015im_/http://images.isiknowledge.com/WOK48B3/images/RID/rid_logo.gif" xlink:title="" />
  </fig>
  <p>The system is the result of research that found that individual
  identity touches many parts of scholarly communications and that
  researcher’s and academic institutions were ready to take some
  ownership of the issue to ensure proper attribution of
  scholarship.</p>
  <p>The Registry is composed of biographical and bibliographic
  components which are accessible at the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/">researcherid.com</ext-link>
  web site. A web services API makes it possible for an institution or
  organization to create and use this information in their systems.</p>
  <p>The biographical component of the registry creates a unique
  identifier and persistent web location for each user. The system is
  designed to allow a researcher to control privacy and access to the
  information in their profile, even if the information was uploaded by
  the researcher’s institution. Researchers can enter and manage
  information about themselves, their work and their affiliations
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.researcherid.com/rid/C-3246-2009">example
  record</ext-link>).</p>
  <p>The bibliographic component of
  <italic><italic>ResearcherID</italic></italic> allows researchers to
  connect articles, patents and other scholarly items to their profile.
  Items can be loaded from
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</ext-link>,
  the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.isiwebofknowledge.com/">Web
  of Science</ext-link> or in a text format into one of three lists.</p>
  <p>As I mentioned, a web service makes it possible for organizations
  to create and manage both biographic and bibliographic information for
  their faculty and researchers. Upload, download and search services
  make this possible. For example, David Palmer at the University of
  Hong Kong uses ResearcherID to create
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://hub.hku.hk/rp/rp00023">identifiers
  for HKU researchers</ext-link>.</p>

  <title><italic><italic>2. What is ORCID, and how does it relate to
  ResearcherID?</italic></italic></title>
  <p>Open Researcher Contributor ID (ORCID) is an initiative to better
  understand how the issue of individual name ambiguity can be solved.
  Currently a cross section of the research community is discussing ways
  to overcome the issue with the hopes of establishing an open registry
  that will be used by the global research community.</p>
  <p>One of the lessons learned from Thomson Reuters’ development of
  <italic><italic>ResearcherID</italic></italic> is that issues of name
  ambiguity and attribution are problems bigger than any one
  organization can address. And, having multiple solutions to the
  problem will not meet the needs of researchers or the scholarly
  community. Based on <italic><italic>ResearcherID’s</italic></italic>
  innovation and success in addressing these issues, Thomson Reuters
  plans to offer <italic><italic>ORCID</italic></italic> the technology
  and infrastructure for managing the biographic registry.</p>
  <p>The initiative has grown from early 2009 conversations between
  <italic><italic>Thomson Reuters</italic></italic> and
  <italic><italic>Nature Publishing Group</italic></italic> into a
  global collaboration of academic institutions, research centers,
  funding agencies, scholarly societies and publishers. To date,
  everyone involved in the effort is volunteering their time and work is
  focused on the business and technical implications of creating an
  independent organization to manage an identity registry system. More
  information on the initiative can be found at the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>

  <title>3.There are numerous other initiatives for unique researcher
  identifiers. What is unique about ResearcherID?</title>
  <p>What is unique about <italic><italic>ResearcherID</italic></italic>
  is that it is a global initiative and not focused on any one
  organization, consortia, country or application. The system also
  ensures privacy and allows researchers to control their information.
  The <italic><italic>ResearcherID</italic></italic> is portable and can
  be included in authored works and used as a dynamic link on the
  researcher’s website.</p>

  <title>4. How does ResearcherID integrate with other Thomson Reuters
  products and outside tools?</title>
  <p>The system was designed to allow all users, independent of any
  Thomson Reuters subscriptions, to benefit from the application. All
  users have the ability to establish an identifier, create and manage a
  biographical profile, and manage a list of scholarly works.</p>
  <p>The <italic><italic>ResearcherID</italic></italic> system is
  closely coupled with EndNote and by May 2010, all ResearcherID users,
  independent of any Thomson Reuters subscriptions, will have access to
  the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611094015/http://www.endnoteweb.com/">web
  version of EndNote</ext-link>.</p>
  <p>For users having access to the <italic><italic>Web of
  Knowledge</italic></italic> there are a number of additional
  integration points:</p>
