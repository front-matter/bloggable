<p>Uwe Hossfeld and Lennart Olsson have just added a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630155127/http://www.nature.com/nature/history/full/nature06242.html">story</a> from a dark time in German science to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630155127/http://www.nature.com/nature/history/index.html">History of Nature</a> website. This article extends an earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630155127/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7109/full/443271a.html">report</a> from September 2006 that uncovered the story of how <em><em>Nature</em></em> was banned in Germany in November 1937.</p>
<p>The arguments used by the German science minister Bernhard Rust at the time are not worth repeating â€“ they are ideological rather than scientific arguments. But the story is interesting for today's scientists because it serves as a reminder that free access to scientific knowledge means much more than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630155127/http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/">open access vs. closed access</a> debate.</p>
