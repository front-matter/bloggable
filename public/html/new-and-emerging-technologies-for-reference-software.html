<p>Jason Rollins gave a presentation with that topic at the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=58" data-cite-meta="{}">STM Innovations Seminar <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=58">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=58?</strong>)</span></a> in London.

<p>Jason talks about some recent trends in reference management software. For him one important new trend is APIs/extensions. I fully agree with him, but we haven’t really seen many tools based on these APIs. Reference managers that provide APIs include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://dev.mendeley.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Mendeley <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://dev.mendeley.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://dev.mendeley.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/api/" data-cite-meta="{}">Endnote <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/api/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/api/?</strong>)</span></a>, Refworks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://developer.mekentosj.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Papers <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://developer.mekentosj.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://developer.mekentosj.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/" data-cite-meta="{}">Zotero <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.connotea.org/wiki/WebAPI" data-cite-meta="{}">Connotea <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.connotea.org/wiki/WebAPI">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.connotea.org/wiki/WebAPI?</strong>)</span></a>. The availability of an API has done a lot for the success of Web 2.0 tools such as Twitter and Flickr.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic was brought up in the discussion: should reference managers track difference versions of an article (e.g. pre-print, post-print, publisher PDF)? According to Jason many Endnote users request this feature. Jason is leading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Endnote <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/?</strong>)</span></a> development team, but also mentions Mendeley, CiteULike and Papers in his presentation.
