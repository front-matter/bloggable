<p>The overall online coverage far exceeds what I see at my usual science meetings, but following the sessions live (including the ability to ask questions) is far more difficult. For that you need video and microblogging (or the two combined in <em><em>Second Life</em></em>). Video of sessions from two rooms was streamed live at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/scienceonline2010" data-cite-meta="{}">Ustream <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/scienceonline2010">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/scienceonline2010?</strong>)</span></a> and <em><em>Second Life</em></em>, but Ustream didn't always work for me (didn't try Second Life, all sessions were recorded and will appear on <em><em>YouTube</em></em> next week).</p>
<p>For me and many others <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> is the perfect microblogging tool for conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263" data-cite-meta="{}">Microblogging the ISMB: A New Approach to Conference Reporting <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263?</strong>)</span></a>). But the use of <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em> in Science 2.0 conferences seems on the decline during the last 12 months because of <em><em>Twitter</em></em>, and at <em><em>ScienceOnline2010</em></em> it was no longer possible to follow sessions using <em><em>FriendFeed</em></em>. <em><em>Twitter</em></em> is wonderful for many things, but makes it very difficult to create a connected discussion around a particular topic such as a conference session. But the <em><em>Twitter</em></em> board was cool:</p>

The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://blog.f1000.com/2010/01/15/on-the-run&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;15jan10/" data-cite-meta="{}">first planning meeting <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://blog.f1000.com/2010/01/15/on-the-run&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;15jan10/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://blog.f1000.com/2010/01/15/on-the-run&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;15jan10/?</strong>)</span></a> took place last Friday. We hope to announce the location and date in the coming weeks, but we are aiming for a bigger (with enough room for at least 250 people) and longer (two days) meeting with enough parallel sessions to cover all the topics that we care about.</p>
<p>One personal goal I have for <em><em>Science Online London 2010</em></em> is to provide an even better experience for those unable to attend in person. <em><em>Second Life</em></em> worked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://network.nature.com/people/joannascott/blog/2009/09/07/science-online-london-links" data-cite-meta="{}">pretty well <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://network.nature.com/people/joannascott/blog/2009/09/07/science-online-london-links">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://network.nature.com/people/joannascott/blog/2009/09/07/science-online-london-links?</strong>)</span></a> for us last year, and we even had one speaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/telepresent_at_the_future/" data-cite-meta="{}">giving his presentation <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/telepresent_at_the_future/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/telepresent_at_the_future/?</strong>)</span></a> this way. But maybe we can do better. Livestreaming of good quality audio is probably the most important thing, the video quality seems less critical. Alternatively, we can synchronize the audio with the slides from the presentation, something <em><em>SlideShare</em></em> calls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast" data-cite-meta="{}">SlideCast <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast?</strong>)</span></a>. We might also find better ways to use <em><em>Twitter</em></em> for microblogging, e.g. by using separate hashtags for every session and a <em><em>Twitter</em></em> board in the sessions.</p>
