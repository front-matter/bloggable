<p>F1000 Research is a <em>publishing program</em> rather than a journal. The format for F1000 Research hasn’t been finalized, and F1000 welcomes comments at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://f1000research.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">blog <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://f1000research.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://f1000research.com/?</strong>)</span></a> or via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/https://twitter.com/#!/F1000Research" data-cite-meta="{}">Twitter <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/https://twitter.com/#!/F1000Research">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/https://twitter.com/#!/F1000Research?</strong>)</span></a> account.</p>
<p>My main question about F1000 Research: is this a preprint archive similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://arxiv.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ArXiv <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://arxiv.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://arxiv.org/?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://precedings.nature.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Nature Precedings <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://precedings.nature.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://precedings.nature.com/?</strong>)</span></a>? I’m a big fan of preprint archives, and I think that – contrary to what most people think – they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/" data-cite-meta="{}">should work particularly well <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/?</strong>)</span></a> for clinical trial data.</p>
