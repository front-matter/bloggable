<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://datacite.labs.orcid-eu.org/">new service</a> allows researchers to add research datasets – and other content with DataCite DOIs, including all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://figshare.com/">figshare</a> content – to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://about.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> profile by integrating with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://search.datacite.org/ui">DataCite Metadata Store</a>. The tool is an adaption (or fork) of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef Metadata Search</a> developed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/https://twitter.com/karlward">Karl Ward</a>, and was developed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/https://twitter.com/gthorisson">Gudmundur Thorisson</a> and myself as part of work in the EU-funded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://odin-project.eu/">ODIN project</a>. More details can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://odin-project.eu/2013/05/13/new-orcid-integrated-data-citation-tool/">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are many things I like about this new DataCite/ORCID integration tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes it easier for researchers to get credit for their research outputs.</li>
<li>it shows the value of persistent identifiers for data, publications and people, and linking them together</li>
<li>it shows the Creative Commons licenses for DataCite content where this info is available, facilitating reuse of content</li>
<li>it demonstrates the power of open source (thanks CrossRef!), open collaboration, standard REST APIs, and lightweight programming (Sinatra/Ruby) and deployment (Vagrant, Amazon EC2, Rackspace) tools</li>
<li>it shows that we don’t need a single – often closed – system, but open services that build on top of each other using accepted community standards. Tools using the ORCID API can immediately reuse the new DataCite content, altmetrics provided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> are a good example</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to explore some of these ideas in the panel <strong>Attribution: Managing Provenance, Ethics, and Metrics</strong> at the combined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013">ORCID/Dryad Meeting</a> in Oxford next Thursday.</p>
