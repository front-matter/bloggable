<p>On Wednesday the NCBI released an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191025/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/images">Images database</a>, compiled from full text resources at the NCBI â€“ initially PubMed Central articles. The images can be searched by several parameters, e.g. figure caption or author.</p>

<p>Using this database, images are now displayed together with the PubMed abstract for PubMed Central articles. More info about these changes can be found in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191025/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so10/so10_pm_display_ncbi_images.html">NLM Bulletin</a>.</p>
