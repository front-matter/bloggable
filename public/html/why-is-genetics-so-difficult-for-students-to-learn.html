<p>This Sunday morning at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/">International Congress of Genetics</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.botany.ubc.ca/people/griffith.htm">Tony Griffiths</a> gave an interesting presentation with the above title. He identified 12 possible reasons why students have problems learning genetics. His main argument: students should learn concepts and principles and apply them creatively in novel situations (the <em><em>research mode</em></em>). Instead, too many details are often crammed into seminars and textbooks. In other words, students often stay at the lowest level of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Bloom%27s_Taxonomy">Bloom's taxonomy</a>, the remembering of knowledge. The highest level, the creation of new knowledge, is seldom reached, although these skills are of course critical for a successful researcher.</p>
<p>Andrew Moore from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.embo.org/scisoc/index.html">EMBO</a> talked about the teaching of genetics in the classroom. He was concerned that a survey found that molecular evolution (or molecular phylogeny) was taught in not more than 30% of European classrooms. He gave some examples of how principles of genetics can be integrated into high school teaching.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Nellen explained his successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.siriuswork.de/sciencebridge.net/tmp/">Science Bridge</a> project of teaching genetics in the classroom, using biology students as teachers. Interestingly, they have not only taught high school students, but also journalists and â€“ priests (German language link <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/artikel/770/134514/">here</a>). Politicians were the only group of people that weren't interested in his offer of a basic science course.</p>
