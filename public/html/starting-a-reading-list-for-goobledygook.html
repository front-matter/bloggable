<p>All science bloggers do a lot of reading for background information, or write blog posts based on a (newly published) paper, blog post or news item. So I thought that it would be a good idea to collect those references in a single place.</p>

<p>Reading lists are perfect for this, and they are easy to create and maintain with web-based reference managers. Reading lists are used in teaching, e.g. to provide a list of required reading material for a class. But I can also see a number of benefits for science blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>they help the blogger to organize his background material for writing</li>
<li>they help the reader find and keep referenced material</li>
<li>they can provide additional reading not mentioned in the blog post</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several good tools for reading lists. I decided to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">CiteULike <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/?</strong>)</span></a>, because what I really want here is a social bookmarking tool that understands references. My Goobledygook reading list is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/group/13987/library" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/group/13987/library">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/group/13987/library?</strong>)</span></a>, the RSS feed is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/rss/group/13987/library" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/rss/group/13987/library">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/rss/group/13987/library?</strong>)</span></a>, and the most recent items in the reading list are also shown in a new sidebar to the right. I started with references to papers, but plan to also include blog posts and other web resources.</p>
