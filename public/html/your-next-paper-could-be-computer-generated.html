<p>Are you tired of writing a paper, based on real experiments? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103729/http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/">SciGen</a> could come to the rescue, at least if you do computer science research. SciGen is a program that creates random papers, complete with results, discussion, graphs and references. Some of these random papers have been accepted at conferences or even for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103729/http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/sharif_paper.pdf">publication</a>.</p>
<p>SciGen is of course a hoax. There are other famous hoaxes in science, including the 1996 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103729/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/index.html">Alan Sokal</a> paper “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity”.</p>
<p>What do these hoaxes have in common? They randomly generate pseudo-scientific language. Important ingredients are buzzword frequently used in the field and standard phrases. If we look carefully, we find examples of this random-talk in our own work as well.</p>
