<p>There are many things I like about this new DataCite/ORCID integration tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes it easier for researchers to get credit for their research outputs.</li>
<li>it shows the value of persistent identifiers for data, publications and people, and linking them together</li>
<li>it shows the Creative Commons licenses for DataCite content where this info is available, facilitating reuse of content</li>
<li>it demonstrates the power of open source (thanks CrossRef!), open collaboration, standard REST APIs, and lightweight programming (Sinatra/Ruby) and deployment (Vagrant, Amazon EC2, Rackspace) tools</li>
<li>it shows that we don’t need a single – often closed – system, but open services that build on top of each other using accepted community standards. Tools using the ORCID API can immediately reuse the new DataCite content, altmetrics provided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://impactstory.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ImpactStory <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://impactstory.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://impactstory.org/?</strong>)</span></a> are a good example</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to explore some of these ideas in the panel <strong>Attribution: Managing Provenance, Ethics, and Metrics</strong> at the combined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013" data-cite-meta="{}">ORCID/Dryad Meeting <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013?</strong>)</span></a> in Oxford next Thursday.</p>
