<p>This blog occasionally does interviews with people providing interesting tools for scholars. These <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/category/interviews/" data-cite-meta="{}">interviews <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/category/interviews/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/category/interviews/?</strong>)</span></a> have always been among my favorite blog posts. This now is obviously an interview with myself, but I felt this is the best format to explain some important news.</p>

<p>Starting May 16 I will be working full-time as technical lead for the PLoS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Article Level Metrics <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/?</strong>)</span></a> (ALM) project. I will help with development of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/" data-cite-meta="{}">PLoS ALM application <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/?</strong>)</span></a>, and will do community developer outreach for this project.</p>

The ALM project was launched in 2009, and I first learned about ALM in a July 2009 presentation by Pete Binfield at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/" data-cite-meta="{}">SciBarCamp Palo Alto <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/?</strong>)</span></a>. A month later I did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/" data-cite-meta="{}">interview with Pete <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/10/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/?</strong>)</span></a> about Article Level Metrics and PLoS ONE.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-article-level-metrics">What is Article Level Metrics?</h3>
<p>Article Level Metrics <em>place transparent and  comprehensive information about the usage and reach of published articles onto the articles themselves, so that the entire academic community can assess their value</em> (from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">PLoS ALM website <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/?</strong>)</span></a>).

<p>Article Level Metrics is part of the larger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/" data-cite-meta="{}">altmetrics <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/?</strong>)</span></a> movement, which also looks at metrics for other scholarly works besides journal articles.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-mean-that-you-will-be-moving-to-san-francisco">Does this mean that you will be moving to San Francisco?</h3>
<p>For personal reasons I will continue to live in Hannover, Germany and work from home as a contractor with occasional trips to San Francisco.</p>
<h3 id="will-you-miss-treating-cancer-patients-and-doing-cancer-research">Will you miss treating cancer patients and doing cancer research?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. This has not been an easy decision. To make the transition easier, I will continue to spend 10% of my time at Hannover Medical School. I will no longer be seeing patients, but this will allow me to conclude the RADIT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242631" data-cite-meta="{}">clinical trial <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242631">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242631?</strong>)</span></a> for testicular cancer patients where I am the principal investigator.</p>
<p>I hope to continue doing research in the new position, but with a focus on information science. There are for example still a lot of things we don’t know about altmetrics. A more detailed analysis of our recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/19/crowdsourcing-the-analysis-of-scholarly-tweets/" data-cite-meta="{}">CrowdoMeter <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/19/crowdsourcing-the-analysis-of-scholarly-tweets/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/19/crowdsourcing-the-analysis-of-scholarly-tweets/?</strong>)</span></a> project (a crowdsourced analysis of tweets linking to scholarly papers) would be a good start.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-happen-with-sciencecard">What will happen with ScienceCard?</h3>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://sciencecard.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ScienceCard <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://sciencecard.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://sciencecard.org/?</strong>)</span></a> is a website that collects author level metrics and was my entry into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/" data-cite-meta="{}">Mendeley/PLoS Binary Battle API contest <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/?</strong>)</span></a> last fall. ScienceCard is based on the PLoS ALM code (which is open source and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/" data-cite-meta="{}">available via Google Code <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/?</strong>)</span></a>). I will decide in the coming months what to do with ScienceCard. This depends mainly on how much author level metrics make sense in the PLoS ALM project.</p>
<h3 id="and-what-will-happen-to-your-other-scholarly-communication-activities">And what will happen to your other scholarly communication activities?</h3>
<p>There is no reason not to continue my other activities, including involvement in the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://about.orcid.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ORCID <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://about.orcid.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://about.orcid.org/?</strong>)</span></a>) initiative, and using WordPress as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/" data-cite-meta="{}">tool to write and publish manuscripts <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/?</strong>)</span></a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-your-future-plans-for-this-blog">What are your future plans for this blog?</h3>
<p>I plan to continue this blog in a very similar format, and I will have more time for more in-depth articles. And of course I will indicate a conflict of interest when I write about Article Level Metrics.</p>
