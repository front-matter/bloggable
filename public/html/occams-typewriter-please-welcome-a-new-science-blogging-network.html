<p>Last Friday the latest science blogging network officially launched: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://occamstypewriter.org/">Occam’s Typewriter</a>. The independent blogging network started out with eight bloggers and one guest blog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://scientopia.org/blogs/thisscientificlife/2010/12/12/occams-typewriter-here-at-last/">all of them well characterized</a> by Bob O’Hara. Most of the bloggers have moved their blog from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092936/http://network.nature.com/">Nature Network</a>, where I wrote next to them from 2007 until September this year.</p>
