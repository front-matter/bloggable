<p>Regular readers of this blog know about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/" data-cite-meta="{}">my current interest in WordPress <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/?</strong>)</span></a> as a tool to create scholarly content. In the last few weeks I have released several WordPress plugins for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/" data-cite-meta="{}">reference management <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/?</strong>)</span></a> and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/" data-cite-meta="{}">create ePub <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/?</strong>)</span></a> files. Obviously I’m not the only person having this idea. Some interesting projects are:</p>

<p>WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, and many science bloggers (including us here at PLoS Blogs) use WordPress. And science bloggers have some specific requirements, e.g. easy to use tools for linking to scholarly papers or aggregators of blog posts about a particular paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.researchblogging.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ResearchBlogging <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.researchblogging.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.researchblogging.org/?</strong>)</span></a>) or science blogging in general (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/" data-cite-meta="{}">ScienceSeeker <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/?</strong>)</span></a>). A number of people use WordPress as a lab notebook (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.carlboettiger.info/" data-cite-meta="{}">Carl Boettinger <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.carlboettiger.info/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.carlboettiger.info/?</strong>)</span></a>). There is no clear difference between WordPress as a scholarly writing tool and WordPress as a blogging tool, and I expect that the amount of scholarly writing done with WordPress will only increase.</p>
<p>Two days ago Ed Yong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/02/02/research-into-reprogrammed-stem-cells-an-interactive-timeline/" data-cite-meta="{}">published an interactive timeline <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/02/02/research-into-reprogrammed-stem-cells-an-interactive-timeline/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/02/02/research-into-reprogrammed-stem-cells-an-interactive-timeline/?</strong>)</span></a> of research into reprogrammed stem cells. John Rennie yesterday cited Ed Yong and this post as a wonderful example of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/02/03/why-ed-yong-is-the-future-of-science-news-and-you-could-be-too/" data-cite-meta="{}">future of science news <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/02/03/why-ed-yong-is-the-future-of-science-news-and-you-could-be-too/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/02/03/why-ed-yong-is-the-future-of-science-news-and-you-could-be-too/?</strong>)</span></a>. The future of science news depends on many things (not least brilliant writers such as Ed and John), but I think we also need better tools to make science writing fun and exciting.</p>
<p>In the hope that this will improve WordPress as a science writing platform, Mark Hahnel from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.science3point0.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Science 3.0 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.science3point0.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.science3point0.com/?</strong>)</span></a> blogging network and me today created the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/wordpress-for-scientists" data-cite-meta="{}">WordPress for Scientists <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/wordpress-for-scientists">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/wordpress-for-scientists?</strong>)</span></a> Google Group.
