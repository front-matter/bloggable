<blockquote>
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday 60 years ago the first volume of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy by <em>J.R.R. Tolkien</em> was published. The quote above obviously doesn’t quiet apply to scholarly publishing, but one recurring theme that I have often heard in the last few years is that of a need for a canonical digital document format for scholarly content that rules all other formats.</p>

<p>A few years ago almost everyone you would have said that <code>xml</code> is that format, with the NLM Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite - which has evolved into <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;jats.nlm.nih.gov&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;JATS: Journal Publishing Tag Set&quot;,&quot;title-short&quot;:&quot;JATS&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">JATS <span class="citation" data-cites="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/">(<span>“JATS,”</span> n.d.)</span></a> - probably the most commonly used Document Type Definition (DTD). <code>xml</code> does many things really well, but also has important shortcomings, most importantly that it is probably not a good format for authors (and don’t tell me that <code>docx</code> and <code>odt</code> are XML-based). We therefore don’t really expect authors to submit manuscripts in JATS <code>xml</code>, but rather convert documents into this format after a manuscript has been accepted for publication. This conversion step is often time-consuming and labor-intensive.</p>
<p>More recently <code>html</code> has become the most interesting candidate for a canonical scholarly document format. The big advantage over <code>xml</code> is that <code>html</code> - or at least <code>html5</code> which is most popular today - is an attractive format for online authoring tools (that is why <code>html</code> is listed both as input and output format) The downside of this flexibility is that it is much harder to embed structure and metadata into <code>html5</code> compared to <code>xml</code>. There are initiatives such as <a href="http://schema.org/" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://schema.org/&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Schema.org is a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages for use by search engines and other applications.&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;schema.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;http://schema.org/&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Schema.org - Schema.org&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">schema.org <span class="citation" data-cites="http://schema.org/">(<span>“Schema.org - Schema.org,”</span> n.d.)</span></a> and <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook" data-cite-meta="{}">HTMLBook <span class="citation" data-cites="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook">(<strong>https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook?</strong>)</span></a> that hope to change that, but we aren’t quiet there yet.</p>
<p>Or maybe we should learn from Tolkien and give up on the idea of a canonical document format and rather spend our energy on building tools that make it easier to transition from one format to another. <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" data-cite-meta="{}">Pandoc <span class="citation" data-cites="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">(<strong>http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/?</strong>)</span></a> is such as tool, but can’t do all the required conversions, e.g. it can’t yet use <code>docx</code> as input. The downside here is that every file conversion runs the risk of loosing important information. But the increase in flexibility hopefully outweights these shortcomings.</p>
