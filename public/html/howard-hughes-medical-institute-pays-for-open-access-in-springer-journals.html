<p>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101248/http://www.hhmi.org/news/springer20070927.html">announced</a> that it will support Open Access in Springer journals through the Springer Open Choice program. HHMI earlier this year made a similar deal with Elsevier and last month became a BiomedCentral member (I wrote about this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101248/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/20/howard-hughes-medical-institute-hhmi-becomes-biomed-central-member">here</a>).</p>
<p>In contrast to articles in Elsevier journals (which become freely available after 6 months and Elsevier holds the copyright), articles in Springer journals will be available immediately and the author will retain the copyright.</p>
<p>I'm glad to see this agreement happen. It probably makes sense for Springer, HHMI and, most importantly, the involved scientists. Even more so now with the charged discussion about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101248/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/26/prism-lobbying-against-open-access">PRISM</a>.</p>
