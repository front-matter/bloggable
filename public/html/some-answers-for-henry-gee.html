<h3 id="1-what-is-your-blog-about">1. What is your blog about?</h3>
<p>I am interested in how the internet is changing the way we publish and communicate science. I write from the perspective of someone that consumes and sometimes produces science. Journal publishers, science librarians, patients and others will look at this topic from a different angle. This blog started as <em><em>Publish or Perish 2.0</em></em>, but I later changed the name to Gobbledygook. Mainly because I liked the word.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-will-you-never-write-about">2. What will you never write about?</h3>
<p>Of course I don't know. But I hope that I will not have to write blog posts that are evaluated, measured and put on a resum√© similar to scientific papers now.</p>
<h3 id="3-have-you-ever-considered-leaving-science">3. Have you ever considered leaving science?</h3>
<p>As a medical doctor in a university hospital I spend part of the day treating patients. I very much like the combination, but sometimes it is very exhausting. And research, both basic and clinical research, can lead into many dead ends. I've been there more than once.</p>
<h3 id="4-what-would-you-do-instead">4. What would you do instead?</h3>
<p>Start a Web 2.0 company. Become a professional chef. Not really.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-do-you-think-will-science-blogging-be-like-in-5-years">5. What do you think will science blogging be like in 5 years?</h3>
<p>I wrote down some of my thoughts on this in the post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053046/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/08/31/science-blogging-is-the-new-email">Science blogging is the new email</a>. Science blogging will be very common and at the same time very specialized. Some science bloggers will be able to make enough money to earn a living from it.</p>
<h3 id="6-what-is-the-most-extraordinary-thing-that-happened-to-you-because-of-blogging">6. What is the most extraordinary thing that happened to you because of blogging?</h3>
<p>Many, many things. Most importantly, meeting a lot of very interesting people both online and in real life.</p>
<h3 id="7-did-you-write-a-blog-post-or-comment-you-later-regretted">7. Did you write a blog post or comment you later regretted?</h3>
<p>Fortunately not too often. When I sounded patronizing.</p>
<h3 id="8-when-did-you-first-learn-about-science-blogging">8. When did you first learn about science blogging?</h3>
<p>From an article in <em><em>Cell</em></em> by Laura Bonetta: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053046/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.04.032">Scientists enter the blogosphere</a>.</p>
<h3 id="9-what-do-your-colleagues-at-work-say-about-your-blogging">9. What do your colleagues at work say about your blogging?</h3>
<p>Most of them don't know about my science blogging. The rest doesn't really care. I hope that will change in 5 years (see #5).</p>
<h3 id="10-how-the-heck-do-you-have-time-to-blog-and-do-research-at-the-same-time">10. How the heck do you have time to blog and do research at the same time?</h3>
<p>Only because blogging means something else to me and doesn't really count as work. I don't blog during work hours. And I blog for fun and not money.</p>
<h3 id="11-extra-credit-are-you-able-to-write-an-entry-to-your-blog-that-takes-the-form-of-a-poem-about-your-research">11. Extra credit: are you able to write an entry to your blog that takes the form of a poem about your research?</h3>
<p>There once was a doctor from Hannover,<br />
it was cancer he tried to uncover.<br />
Doing a mouse model was all the hype,<br />
but instead of a phenotype,<br />
all he got was a hangover.</p>
