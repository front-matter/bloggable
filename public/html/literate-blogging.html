<blockquote>
Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the World Wide Web.
</blockquote>
<p>Literatue Programming by <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/" data-cite-meta="{}">Donald Knuth <span class="citation" data-cites="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/">(<strong>http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/?</strong>)</span></a> (1983) is a seminal book that introduces the concept of literate programming. Using technology available in 2014 we can make a small but important change to the last sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
The program is also viewed as a hypertext document on the World Wide Web.
</blockquote>
<p>This blog post is an example for such a document. The page is written in <strong><strong>markdown</strong></strong> (markdown file available <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/mfenner.github.io/blob/source/_posts/2014-04-04-literate-blogging.Rmd" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://github.com/mfenner/mfenner.github.io/blob/source/_posts/2014-04-04-literate-blogging.Rmd">(<strong>https://github.com/mfenner/mfenner.github.io/blob/source/_posts/2014-04-04-literate-blogging.Rmd?</strong>)</span></a>), and all embedded code was executed when this page was generated, i.e. when the markdown was converted to HTML and the blog post was published. To demonstrate this I have embedded code in three different languages below - the output is the second code block.</p>
<p>In R you have</p>
<pre><code>cat(&#39;Hello, R world!\n&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hello, R world!</code></pre>
<p>Or Python</p>
<pre><code>print &quot;Hello, Python world!&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hello, Python world!</code></pre>
<p>Or Ruby</p>
<pre><code>puts &#39;Hello, Ruby world!&#39;</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hello, Ruby world!</code></pre>
<p>You can also embed code within text blocks (inline), so that <code>3.48 * 723</code> becomes <strong><strong>2516.04</strong></strong>. Another important option is to generate figures using the embedded code, e.g. the following figure taken from a recent publication.</p>
<pre><code># code for figure 1: density plots for citation counts for PLOS Biology
