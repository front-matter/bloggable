<p>A March 13 Nature News article (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080313/full/news.2008.670.html" data-cite-meta="{}">Six degrees of messaging <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080313/full/news.2008.670.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080313/full/news.2008.670.html?</strong>)</span></a>) talks about a study on Microsoft Messenger chat users. Any random two Microsoft Messenger users (out of about 240 million) could be connected two each other via an average of 6 users that have chatted with each other.</p>
<p>This study is just another confirmation of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation" data-cite-meta="{}">six degrees of separation <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation?</strong>)</span></a> concept. A 2001 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/98/2/404.pdf" data-cite-meta="{}">PNAS paper <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/98/2/404.pdf">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/98/2/404.pdf?</strong>)</span></a> found the same for scientific collaboration networks, using common authorship for a paper as connector. The mean distance of two random authors in the MEDLINE database was 4.6.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, you can almost expect the same connections through joint authorship between two random Nature Network members. Now if I could only find a tool that would help with that task. Not everybody is a mathematician and can simply calculate his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html" data-cite-meta="{}">Erdös number <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612094211/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html?</strong>)</span></a> right from the American Mathematical Society website.</p>
