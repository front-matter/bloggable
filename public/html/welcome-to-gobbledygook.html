For me personally it all started a few weeks ago with a phone call one Friday evening from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.php#pbinfield" data-cite-meta="{}">Pete Binfield <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.php#pbinfield">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.php#pbinfield?</strong>)</span></a>, Publisher of PLoS ONE and the PLoS Community Journals.</p>
<p>Since August 2007 and until today I was blogging over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner" data-cite-meta="{}">Nature Network <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner?</strong>)</span></a>. The focus of that blog was how the internet is changing scientific publishing. This is obviously a very broad topic. A lot of my blog posts looked at rather technical aspects, including new products and services (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/29/elsevier-launches-sciverse-integrates-sciencedirect-scopus-more" data-cite-meta="{}">last post <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/29/elsevier-launches-sciverse-integrates-sciencedirect-scopus-more">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/29/elsevier-launches-sciverse-integrates-sciencedirect-scopus-more?</strong>)</span></a> was about Elsevier’s SciVerse that launched last weekend).</p>
<p>I will continue to write about the same topics. I particularly like to continue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/31/bye-bye-nature-network" data-cite-meta="{}">interviews <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/31/bye-bye-nature-network">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/31/bye-bye-nature-network?</strong>)</span></a>, and I want to write more recipes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club" data-cite-meta="{}">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club?</strong>)</span></a>). Of course I also want to try different things, e.g. shorter blog posts of interesting stuff I find (something I currently post on Twitter). Please contact me if you have something related to scientific publishing that you want me to write about.</p>
<p>PLoS Blogs is not the only new science blogging network. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/aug/31/blogging-digital-media" data-cite-meta="{}">Guardian Science Blogs <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/aug/31/blogging-digital-media">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/aug/31/blogging-digital-media?</strong>)</span></a> launched just yesterday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scientopia.org/blogs/" data-cite-meta="{}">Scientopia <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scientopia.org/blogs/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scientopia.org/blogs/?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.science3point0.com/blogs/" data-cite-meta="{}">Science 3.0 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.science3point0.com/blogs/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.science3point0.com/blogs/?</strong>)</span></a> in the last few weeks.

<p>This is a good week for science blogging for another reason.

Most relevant to the launch of PLoS Blogs is the panel discussion Friday afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel2" data-cite-meta="{}">The state of science blogging? <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel2">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel2?</strong>)</span></a></p>

<p>There will of course be other exciting sessions.

And a number of sessions focus on open data, a trending topic I’m personally very interested in.
