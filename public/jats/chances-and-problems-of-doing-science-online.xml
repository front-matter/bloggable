<p>The blog post is required reading for everybody interested in science
and Web 2.0 and has attracted a lot of thoughtful comments (on the blog

Museion in Copenhagen</ext-link> reminded me that there are limitations
of what can be done online. My blog focusses on talking about science
rather than doing science, but this post is about doing science online.
My research focusses on clinical cancer research, and in this field the
advantages and limitations of doing science online are obviously
different from other subject areas (bioinformatics for example obviously
looks very different). It probably makes sense to ask yourself the
following questions:</p>

  <p>Electronic medical records

  patient care and reduce costs</ext-link>. But for now, often only some
  clinical information (particularly lab and radiology results) is
  available electronically and paper-based patient records are still
  commonly used. And both electronic and paper-based records have to be
  adapted to be useful for clinical research, e.g. by allowing a
  detailed documentation of adverse events.</p>
  <p>The raw clinical data of a patient in a trial (called
  <italic><italic>source data</italic></italic> in clinical research)
  are entered into a case-report form
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report_form">CRF</ext-link>).
  The purpose of this two-step process is to make sure that all required
  data are collected and that they are entered correctly. Many clinical
  trials now use electronic CRFs or electronic data capture (EDC). But
  these tools are still surprisingly difficult to use and more expensive
  than paper-based solutions, so that many trials stick to paper CRFs
  and enter the data into a computer at a later stage. It also doesn't
  help that the EDC market is very fragmented, so that institutions have
  to learn to use several different tools.</p>

  <title>Do you regularly collaborate with scientists in other
  locations?</title>
  <p>Most clinical trials are multi-center trials that are conducted in
  different locations, often even in different countries or continents.
  The coordination of the different trial locations uses email and web
  conferencing, but often relies more on human resources than on modern
  Web 2.0 tools.</p>

  <title>Is information about ongoing research projects publicly
  available?</title>
  <p>Clinical research is one of only a few research areas where
  information about (almost) all ongoing research project is publicly
  available. Clinical trial registries serve two purposes. They make it
  much easier for patients and their treating physicians to find
  relevant clinical trials. And they allow clinical researchers to
  understand what clinical research is going on in their field, and to
  avoid publication bias.

  <p>An article in the <italic><italic>BMJ</italic></italic> last month

  tries to provide guidance on how to provide raw clinical data for
  publication. The main focus of the paper is patient privacy.
  Publication of raw clinical data either as dataset or as part of a
  research paper is still very uncommon. The meta-analysis of individual
  patient
  data<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances_and_problems_of_doing_science_online/#fn2">2</ext-link></sup>

  of the required effort is probably underused.</p>

  <p>Patient privacy is a major concern when publishing raw clinical
  data, and it's therefore critical to remove all identifying
  information from the dataset. This not only includes
