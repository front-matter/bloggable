I am again one of the organizers (together with <em><em>Lou Woodley</em></em> from Nature.com and <em><em>Kaitlin Thaney</em></em> from Digital Science), and I’m getting both excited and nervous the closer we get to September.</p>

<p>We have recently posted a first draft of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.html" data-cite-meta="{}">conference program <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.html?</strong>)</span></a>, and you can see that we are trying something new. In addition to the keynotes, panel discussions and breakout sessions we had the last few years we have also scheduled four workshops for the second day of the conference. I’m doing a workshop called <strong><strong>Beyond scholarly publication</strong></strong> together with <em><em>Eva Amsen</em></em> (The Node) and <em><em>Mark Hahnel</em></em> (FigShare). The idea is to really have a hands-on experience, and in this workshop we will focus on blogs and related tools. We will try to do something interesting both for someone who wants to start a science blog, but also for more experienced writers (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scholarlyhtml.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Scholarly HTML <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scholarlyhtml.org/?</strong>)</span></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/" data-cite-meta="{}">ePub <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/?</strong>)</span></a>). We haven’t work out the details, so please drop us a note if there is a particular topic that you want to see covered. All workshops will focus on <strong><strong>Spinal Muscular Atrophy</strong></strong> as a theme, and we hope that everybody has learned a few tricks by the end of the day.</p>
<p>We are still looking for breakout session suggestions for the first day of the conference. If you have a good idea, please add it to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">wiki <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, as we hope to have a program that is (close to) final by July.</p>
