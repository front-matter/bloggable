<p>In November 2008 I wrote a blog post called
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/02/how-do-you-read-papers">How
do you read papers?</ext-link> The blog post was actually about
different strategies to <italic><italic>find</italic></italic>
interesting papers, e.g. browsing journal tables of content (TOC),
different search strategies, filtering by papers others read, or
filtering by experts (e.g. <italic><italic>Faculty of
1000</italic></italic>). A paper by

(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000204">Defrosting
the Digital Library: Bibliographic Tools for the Next Generation
Web</ext-link>) also talked about finding strategies and the best tools
for this.</p>
<p>In this blog post I want to talk about the actual reading of
scientific papers that you found with one of the strategies mentioned
above. There are some interesting recent developments, and I think we
will see some significant changes in how we read papers in 2010.</p>
<sec id="printed-journal">
  <title>Printed journal</title>
  <p>Holding the printed journal in your hands is probably still the
  most satisfying reading experience because of professional typesetting
  and color reproduction. But unless you have a personal journal
  subscription, it is not convenient as you would have to go to the
  library to read the paper. Plus, many journals no longer produce a
  printed version, or the library has only an electronic
  subscription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="photocopy">
  <title>Photocopy</title>
  <p>This used to be the most common way to read papers 20 years ago.
  But the quality of photocopies is usually worse than a printout of an
  electronic version, and photocopies are far more inconvenient to
  obtain. Reading photocopied papers will only be necessary for the
  small number of journals that produce no electronic version, or for
  older
  papers.<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="pdf-printout">
  <title>PDF printout</title>
  <p>This is the way most people read scientific papers today, unless
  they just want to look up small parts of it. Quality color printers
  have become affordable, and the reading experience is similar to the
  printed journal with the added convenience of electronic distribution.
  Most people use PDF printouts for reading, and later discard the paper
  copy, sometimes even the same day. This is not only more expensive
  than reading on an electronic device, but also not very friendly to
  the
  environment.<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/#fn2">2</ext-link></sup></p>

<sec id="reading-pdfs-on-a-computer">
  <title>Reading PDFs on a computer</title>
  <p>This approach appears to be very common for reading just parts of a
  paper, e.g. to look up experimental details, a figure or reference.
  Most people now store papers as PDF (hopefully with an intelligent
  program such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</ext-link>)
  and not the PDF printouts. Looking at the PDF on the screen is
  therefore often the first step, and then the decision is made whether
  or not to print out the paper to read it in more detail. Reading PDFs
  on screen is possible, but not really convenient for longer texts.
  Screen sizes are often too small for the PDF format (A4 or US letter).
  Many people don't like the eye strain from looking at a screen for
  longer periods of time, although this is probably more relevant for
  reading books rather than reading a scientific paper.</p>

  that enhances PDF files of the <italic><italic>Semantic Biochemical

  <title>Reading on a mobile device</title>
  <p>Many mobile devices such as the iPhone can open PDFs and

  or US letter format are almost impossible to read on a small
  screen.</p>

  format</ext-link> is more suitable for smaller screens found on mobile
  devices. ePub is usually used for e-Books, but the Open Access
  publisher Hindawi
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111551/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">since
  2008 provides papers also in that format</ext-link>. Although ePub is
  more suitable than PDF for mobile devices, it doesn't solve the
  problem that figures and tables are simply difficult to show on a
  small screen. Mobile devices are probably great for reading journal
  table of contents or the abstract of a paper (and an RSS reader such
  as

  <p>The screen of an e-Reader uses

  ink</ext-link> which not only means a much longer battery life, but
  also a very pleasing reading experience, including reading in direct
  sunlight. Electronic ink is black &amp; white, which is not a problem
  for fiction books, but limits the use for scholarly papers (and
  scientific textbooks). Ideally an e-Reader should have a 10â€³ screen,
  similar in size to A4 or US letter paper.</p>
