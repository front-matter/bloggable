<p>This is the last <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner">Gobbledygook</a> post on PLOS Blogs, and at the same time the first post at the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/">new Github blog location</a>. I have been blogging at PLOS Blogs since the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/blogosphere/">PLOS Blogs Network</a> was launched in September 2010, so this step wasn’t easy. But I have two good reasons.</p>
<p>In May 2012 I started to work as technical lead for the <a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLOS Article-Level Metrics</a> project. Although this is contract work, and I also do other things - including spending 5% of my time as clinical researcher at Hannover Medical School - this created the awkward situation that I was never quite sure whether I was blogging as Martin Fenner or as someone working for PLOS. This was all in my head, as I never had any restrictions in my blogging from PLOS. With the recent launch of the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/">PLOS Tech Blog</a> there is now a good venue for the kind of topics I like to write about, and I have started to work on two posts for this new blog.</p>
<p>There will always be topics for which the PLOS Tech Blog is not a good fit, and for these posts I have launched the new personal blog at Github. But the main reason for this new blog is a technical one: I’m moving away from blogging on Wordpress to writing my posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> (a lightweight markup language), that are then transformed into static HTML pages using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>. Last weekend I co-organized the workshop <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki"><strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong></a> together with <a href="http://twitter.com/houshuang">Stian Håklev</a>. A full workshop report will follow in another post, but the discussions before, at and after the workshop convinced me that <strong><strong>Scholarly Markdown</strong></strong> has a bright future and that it is time to move more of my writing to markdown. At the end of the workshop each participant suggested a <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki/Todo-list-from-workshop">todo item</a> that he/she would be working on, and my todo item was “Think about document type where MD shines”. Markdown might be good for writing scientific papers, but I think it really shines in shorter scientific documents that can easily be shared with others. And blog posts are a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The new site is work in progress. Over time I will copy over all old blog posts from PLOS Blogs, and will work on the layout as well as additional features. Special thanks to <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettiger</a> for helping me to get started with Jekyll and Github pages.</p>
