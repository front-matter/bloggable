<p>This blog entry is primarily intended for science educators that are interested in starting a blog for their teaching activities. Some of them will not be familiar with blogging and other web 2.0 tools. Not the typical audience of this blog, but I would greatly appreciate feedback, as I'm in the process of writing an article about this topic (in German).</p>

<p>A good starting point is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://plcmclearning.blogspot.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Learning 2.0 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://plcmclearning.blogspot.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://plcmclearning.blogspot.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, a self-learning program originally intended to teach librarians about blogs, wikis, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.flickr.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Flickr <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.flickr.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.flickr.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, RSS, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.technorati.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Technorati <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.technorati.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.technorati.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.youtube.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">YouTube <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.youtube.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.youtube.com/?</strong>)</span></a> and other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0" data-cite-meta="{}">Web 2.0 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0?</strong>)</span></a> tools.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-i-start-a-blog">Why should I start a blog?</h3>
<p>Because a blog could help with teaching students. A blog can serve as a simple noticeboard for lecture topics, homework assignments, etc. It is also a great place to post additional material. But more importantly, students can comment, ask questions or make suggestions. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://ncwcbio101.wordpress.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">This class <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://ncwcbio101.wordpress.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://ncwcbio101.wordpress.com/?</strong>)</span></a> by Bora Zivkovic is one example. Oliver Obst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.slideshare.net/obsto/science-blogs-and-online-forums-as-teaching-tools-the-library-view-presentation/" data-cite-meta="{}">pointed out <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.slideshare.net/obsto/science-blogs-and-online-forums-as-teaching-tools-the-library-view-presentation/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.slideshare.net/obsto/science-blogs-and-online-forums-as-teaching-tools-the-library-view-presentation/?</strong>)</span></a> that blogs (and other online tools) can save time (and money) compared to one-by-one interactions in person or via email. The motivation for students is nicely explained in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/2008/08/17/teaching-online-with-drupal/" data-cite-meta="{}">this blog post <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/2008/08/17/teaching-online-with-drupal/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/2008/08/17/teaching-online-with-drupal/?</strong>)</span></a> by Meredith Farkas: blogging or posting comments on blogs is a great way for students to reflect what they have learned and to discuss it with fellow students. Tony Griffith recently talked about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.sciencebridge.net/uploads/akt-ver-attatchments/Griffiths_icg_08.pdf" data-cite-meta="{}">why do students find genetics so difficult to learn? <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.sciencebridge.net/uploads/akt-ver-attatchments/Griffiths_icg_08.pdf">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.sciencebridge.net/uploads/akt-ver-attatchments/Griffiths_icg_08.pdf?</strong>)</span></a>. He emphasized that students typically are not taught the <em><em>research mode</em></em>, where thinking and problem-solving are more important than learning facts.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-host-the-blog">Where do I host the blog?</h3>
<p>Most teaching blogs will be hosted at a university server. The university IT department will probably offer a blogging platform such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://movabletype.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">MovableType <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://movabletype.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://movabletype.org/?</strong>)</span></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://wordpress.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">WordPress <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://wordpress.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://wordpress.org/?</strong>)</span></a>. If the university IT department doesn't offer such a service, blogs can also be hosted somewhere else. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.edublogs.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Edublogs <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.edublogs.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.edublogs.org/?</strong>)</span></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.21classes.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">21classes <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.21classes.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.21classes.com/?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.classblogmeister.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Class Blogmeister <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.classblogmeister.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://www.classblogmeister.com/?</strong>)</span></a> not only offer blog hosting, but offer additional features such as a central portal for all blogs, class blogs, access restricted to students, control of student entries.</p>
<h3 id="where-can-i-find-other-people-interested-in-edublogging">Where can I find other people interested in edublogging?</h3>
<p>Many science bloggers are also involved in edublogging, and you find interesting discussions about edublogging both here in Nature Network or in many other science blogs (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://search.technorati.com/edublog" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://search.technorati.com/edublog">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://search.technorati.com/edublog?</strong>)</span></a>). The Edublogs magazine (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://magazine.edublogs.org/2008/01/28/who-are-the-top-edubloggers/" data-cite-meta="{}">this post <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://magazine.edublogs.org/2008/01/28/who-are-the-top-edubloggers/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://magazine.edublogs.org/2008/01/28/who-are-the-top-edubloggers/?</strong>)</span></a> on popular edubloggers) is another good starting point.</p>
