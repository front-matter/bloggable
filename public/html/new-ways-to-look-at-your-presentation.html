<p>Presentations can also be created online. Google Docs and Zoho Show have been around for a while now, but 280Slides<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn7" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>7</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn7">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn7?</strong>)</span></a></sup> is a fairly new offering with a very slick interface. The advantages of these programs: slides can be created by several authors working together and slides can be easily shared. But presentations created with Powerpoint can also be shared online. Slideshare and Scribd are the most popular tools for this, and since last week these presentations can be embedded into Nature Network blog posts. By default, these presentations are public and can be seen by everybody. But they can also be uploaded as private presentations and only those that know the secret URL can see them. Presentations in the life sciences can also be uploaded to Nature Preceedings<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn8" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>8</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn8">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn8?</strong>)</span></a></sup>. This way the scientific presentation receives a DOI and becomes citable. But Nature Preceedings has still a long way to go with currently only about 50 presentations available. Which is a bit suprising, since it looks like the perfect platform to host conference presentations.</p>
<p>YouTube videos or podcasts are probably the preferred format to share presentations that also include the recorded audio. Having the audio available is especially important for those presentations that have little text on their slides. Many presentations from the TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn9" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>9</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn9">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn9?</strong>)</span></a></sup> have been made available as TEDTalks, including this one by Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor:</p>
