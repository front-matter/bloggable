<p><em><em>Cellular Therapy and Transplantation</em></em> today published my paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090740/http://dx.doi.org/10.3205/ctt-2010-en-000087.01" data-cite-meta="{}">Reference Management meets Web 2.0 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090740/http://dx.doi.org/10.3205/ctt-2010-en-000087.01">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090740/http://dx.doi.org/10.3205/ctt-2010-en-000087.01?</strong>)</span></a>. Regular readers of this blog probably know about most of the things I talk about in the paper, but I hope it is a good introduction for those new to reference management.</p>
<p>The paper wouldn’t be possible without FriendFeed, because Claudia Koltzenburg – the Managing Editor of the journal and regular contributor to FriendFeed – contacted me after one of our discussions there.</p>
