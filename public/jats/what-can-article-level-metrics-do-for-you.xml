<p><italic>Article-level metrics (ALMs) provide a wide range of metrics
about the uptake of an individual journal article by the scientific
community after publication. They include citations, usage statistics,
discussions in online comments and social media, social bookmarking, and
recommendations. In this essay, we describe why article-level metrics
are an important extension of traditional citation-based journal metrics
and provide a number of example from ALM data collected for PLOS
Biology.</italic></p>

<p>The scientific impact of a particular piece of research is reflected
in how this work is taken up by the scientific community. The first
systematic approach that was used to assess impact, based on the
technology available at the time, was to track citations and aggregate
them by journal. This strategy is not only no longer necessary â€” since
now we can easily track citations for individual articles â€” but also,
and more importantly, journal-based metrics are now considered a poor
performance measure for individual articles (Campbell, 2008; Glänzel
&amp; Wouters, 2013). One major problem with journal-based metrics is
the variation in citations per article, which means that a small
percentage of articles can skew, and are responsible for, the majority
of the journal-based citation impact factor, as shown by Campbell (2008)
for the 2004 <italic>Nature</italic> Journal Impact Factor.
<bold><bold>Figure 1</bold></bold> further illustrates this point,
showing the wide distribution of citation counts between <italic>PLOS
Biology</italic> research articles published in 2010. <italic>PLOS
Biology</italic> research articles published in 2010 have been cited a
median 19 times to date in Scopus, but 10% of them have been cited 50 or
more times, and two articles (Dickson, Wang, Krantz, Hakonarson, &amp;
Goldstein, 2010; Narendra et al., 2010) more than 300 times.
<italic>PLOS Biology</italic> metrics are used as examples throughout
this essay, and the dataset is available in the supporting information
(<bold><bold>Data S1</bold></bold>). Similar data are available for an
increasing number of other publications and organizations.</p>

<p>Scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be
adequately measured by any single indicator (Bollen, Sompel, Hagberg,
&amp; Chute, 2009; Glänzel &amp; Wouters, 2013; Schekman &amp;
Patterson, 2013). To this end, PLOS has collected and displayed a
variety of metrics for all its articles since 2009. The array of
different categorised article-level metrics (ALMs) used and provided by
PLOS as of August 2013 are shown in <bold><bold>Figure 2</bold></bold>.
In addition to citations and usage statistics, i.e., how often an
article has been viewed and downloaded, PLOS also collects metrics
about: how often an article has been saved in online reference managers,
such as Mendeley; how often an article has been discussed in its
comments section online, and also in science blogs or in social media;
and how often an article has been recommended by other scientists. These
additional metrics provide valuable information that we would miss if we
only consider citations. Two important shortcomings of citation-based
metrics are that (1) they take years to accumulate and (2) citation
analysis is not always the best indicator of impact in more practical
fields, such as clinical medicine (Eck, Waltman, Raan, Klautz, &amp;
Peul, 2013). Usage statistics often better reflect the impact of work in
more practical fields, and they also sometimes better highlight articles
of general interest (for example, the 2006 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>
article on the citation advantage of Open Access articles (Eysenbach,
2006), one of the 10 most-viewed articles published in <italic>PLOS
Biology</italic>).</p>

<p>A bubble chart showing all 2010 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>
articles (<bold><bold>Figure 3</bold></bold>) gives a good overview of
the year’s views and citations, plus it shows the influence that the
article type (as indicated by dot color) has on an article’s performance
as measured by these metrics. The weekly <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>
publication schedule is reflected in this figure, with articles
published on the same day present in a vertical line. <bold><bold>Figure
3</bold></bold> also shows that the two most highly cited 2010
<italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research articles are also among the most
viewed (indicated by the red arrows), but overall there isn’t a strong
correlation between citations and views. The most-viewed article
published in 2010 in <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> is an essay on
Darwinian selection in robots (Floreano &amp; Keller, 2010). Detailed
usage statistics also allow speculatulation about the different ways
that readers access and make use of published literature; some articles
are browsed or read online due to general interest while others that are
downloaded (and perhaps also printed) may reflect the reader’s intention
to look a</p>
