<p>In his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.plos.org/blog/2010/08/31/the-niche-blog-network-lessons-from-the-past-visions-for-the-future/">introductory post</a>, PLoS community manager Brian Mossop talks about how PLoS Blogs came to life, and the lessons learned from other blogging networks. For me personally it all started a few weeks ago with a phone call one Friday evening from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.php#pbinfield">Pete Binfield</a>, Publisher of PLoS ONE and the PLoS Community Journals.</p>
<p>Since August 2007 and until today I was blogging over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner">Nature Network</a>. The focus of that blog was how the internet is changing scientific publishing. This is obviously a very broad topic. A lot of my blog posts looked at rather technical aspects, including new products and services (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/29/elsevier-launches-sciverse-integrates-sciencedirect-scopus-more">last post</a> was about Elsevier’s SciVerse that launched last weekend).</p>
<p>I will continue to write about the same topics. I particularly like to continue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/31/bye-bye-nature-network">interviews</a>, and I want to write more recipes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe: Distributing papers for a journal club</a>). Of course I also want to try different things, e.g. shorter blog posts of interesting stuff I find (something I currently post on Twitter). Please contact me if you have something related to scientific publishing that you want me to write about.</p>
<p>PLoS Blogs is not the only new science blogging network. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/aug/31/blogging-digital-media">Guardian Science Blogs</a> launched just yesterday, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scientopia.org/blogs/">Scientopia</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.science3point0.com/blogs/">Science 3.0</a> in the last few weeks. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://scienceblogging.org/2010/08/19/some-thoughts-about-science-blog-aggregation/">Scienceblogging.org</a>, an aggregator of science blogs (to keep track of all those great blog posts), was launched by Anton Zuiker, Bora Zivkovic and Dave Munger two weeks ago.</p>
<p>This is a good week for science blogging for another reason. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science Online London Conference</a> takes place this Friday and Saturday. Most relevant to the launch of PLoS Blogs is the panel discussion Friday afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel2">The state of science blogging?</a></p>

<p>There will of course be other exciting sessions. The panel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel1">“Rebooting” (aka the future of) science journalism</a> with David Dobbs, Ed Yong, Martin Robbins and Alice Bell should be a lot of fun. The closing panel discussion on Saturday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel3">If you build it, will they come?</a> will look at the adoption (or lack thereof) of  Web 2.0 tools for scholarly communication, based on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.rin.ac.uk/our-work/communicating-and-disseminating-research/use-and-relevance-web-20-researchers">recent report</a> by the Research Information Network. And a number of sessions focus on open data, a trending topic I’m personally very interested in. Together with Geoff Bilder and Gudmundur Thorisson I will moderate a session <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#breakout11">ORCID as unique author identifier: what is it good for and should we worry or be happy?</a></p>
<p>Most importantly, Science Online London is a great opportunity to meet many of my fellow science bloggers in person, and this includes Brian Mossop, the PLoS Blogs community manager.
