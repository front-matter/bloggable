It is time to revisit the topic, in particular since our approach to citing data associated with a publication has changed since 2011.</p>
<p>Component DOIs are explained in the <a href="http://help.crossref.org/components" data-cite-meta="{}">CrossRef Help System <span class="citation" data-cites="http://help.crossref.org/components">(<strong>http://help.crossref.org/components?</strong>)</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
DOIs may be assigned to items that are part of a journal article, book chapter, or any other content item. A component would typically be a figure, table, or image which is part of or referred to by the parent item. Assigning a DOI to a component allows direct linking to the component item.
</blockquote>
<p>Component DOIs are DOIs, i.e. persistent identifiers that link directly to the resource in question, e.g. a figure in a publication. The component DOI for a figure in a PLOS paper used in the 2011 post still <a href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002" data-cite-meta="{&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1371/journal.pone.0006022&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;1932-6203&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006022&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Background The impact of scientific publications has traditionally been expressed in terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. Methodology We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. Conclusions Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;PLOS ONE&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;6&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2009,6]]},&quot;page&quot;:&quot;e6022&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Principal Component Analysis of 39 Scientific Impact Measures&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;}">works as expected <span class="citation" data-cites="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002">(<span>“A Principal Component Analysis of 39 Scientific Impact Measures,”</span> 2009)</span></a>, despite changes to the URL of the journal landing page.</p>
<p>The problem with component DOIs is the problem with DOIs in general: there is basic functionality common to all DOIs, and there are additional services specific to subgroups of DOIs. This confuses users - in particular since there is no easy way to immediately see what kind of DOI they have in front of them - and in the case of component DOIs there is one important feature missing.</p>
<p>DOis are assigned by registration agencies (CrossRef and DataCite are the most relevant ones for scholarly content), and these RAs have built different services around DOIs, e.g. different ways to describe and search the metadata (title, authors, etc.) associated with a DOI. Component DOIs are again different, the most important difference is that in the CrossRef implementation they they are not discoverable by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv22n3.2010.06" data-cite-meta="{&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.3789/isqv22n3.2010.06&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;1041-0031&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv22n3.2010.06&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,21]]},&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Feeney&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Patricia&quot;}],&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Information Standards Quarterly&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv22n3.2010.06&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2010]]},&quot;page&quot;:&quot;27&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;DOIs for Journals: Linking and Beyond&quot;,&quot;title-short&quot;:&quot;DOIs for Journals&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;}">querying the CrossRef system <span class="citation" data-cites="https://doi.org/10.3789/isqv22n3.2010.06">(Feeney, 2010)</span></a>. Component DOIs are also always associated with a parent DOI (for the article, book, etc.). Although this is the expected behaviour, we shouldn’t expect component DOIs to always look like an extension of the parent DOI, as in <code>10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.g002</code> used in the example above.</p>
<p>In essence, a component DOI is a <strong><strong>DOI light</strong></strong>. We can use them for persistent linking, but we can’t use them for discovery via the CrossRef Metadata Search (and by extension other indexing services). A common use case for component DOIs is supplementary information in a journal article. Content in supplementary information files is already much harder to find than content in the body of an article, using component DOIs instead of regular DOIs makes the content again harder to find.</p>
<p>All of this might not have been much of an issue when I wrote the 2011 post, but making the data underlying a publication publicly available and discoverable is increasingly becoming something that funders, publishers and institutions expect. Most of these data are not deposited in dedicated data repositories, but in supplementary information files (for PLOS articles published since March 2014 this is true for more than 50% of papers). Using regular DOIs for supplementary information files with proper metadata and proper inclusion in indexing services will make it easier to find, access and reuse these data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that still leaves us with the problem that the supplementary information files then will have CrossRef DOIs, whereas data repositories typically use DataCite DOIs, so that we need to search for these datasets in two different places. But that is material for another post.</p>
