<p>Last week the first public beta (version 0.5) of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092613/http://paperpile.com/">Paperpile</a> was released (available for Mac and Linux). Paperpile is a desktop reference manager with typical features: search in PubMed, Google Scholar or ArXiv, import PDF files, support for BibTex and other standard file formates, etc. Paperpile currently doesn’t sync with a web-based version, and Paperpile doesn’t insert citations into manuscripts.</p>

<p>What is interesting about Paperpile is that the source code is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092613/https://github.com/wash/paperpile">github</a> (using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092613/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">GNU Affero General Public License</a>).
