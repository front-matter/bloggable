<p>On Wednesday the NCBI released an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191025/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/images" data-cite-meta="{}">Images database <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191025/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/images">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191025/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/images?</strong>)</span></a>, compiled from full text resources at the NCBI – initially PubMed Central articles. The images can be searched by several parameters, e.g. figure caption or author.</p>
