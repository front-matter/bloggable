<p>A year ago today I wrote my first blog post on Nature Network (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Open access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research?</strong>)</span></a>). This is blog post #84 one year later and a good time to reflect on the experience. In May of last year I started the science blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://blog.xartrials.com/" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>in a nutshell</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://blog.xartrials.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://blog.xartrials.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, hosted on my own server and written just for fun. I discovered Nature Network in July and started <strong>Publish or Perish 2.0</strong>. In November 2007 I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/11/11/a-case-for-goobledygook" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>changed the blog name</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/11/11/a-case-for-goobledygook">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/11/11/a-case-for-goobledygook?</strong>)</span></a> to <strong>Gobbledygook</strong>.</p>
<p>I try to write about the paper writing process from the perspective of a researcher. I’m interested in the technical changes in paper writing thanks to Web 2.0. Open access is another important topic and the perspective of a researcher is obviously very different from a journal publisher, science library or the interested public. I am sometimes not comfortable to write about open access, as this is a very political topic and the discussion can move away from arguments and into something about doing the right thing. That’s why I would never write about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design or some of the other hotly debated topics in science blogging.</p>
<p>The blog post that received the most comments is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/06/14/my-paper-writing-dream-machine-1-0" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>My Paper Writing Dream Machine 1.0</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/06/14/my-paper-writing-dream-machine-1-0">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/06/14/my-paper-writing-dream-machine-1-0?</strong>)</span></a>. That was also one of my favorite blog posts as I would love to see more of the potential of Web 2.0 technologies in our paper writing tools. I also enjoyed the dicussion on posters at scientific meetings (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/03/01/are-posters-worth-the-effort" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Are posters worth the effort?</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/03/01/are-posters-worth-the-effort">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/03/01/are-posters-worth-the-effort?</strong>)</span></a>) and on blogging from conferences (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/05/17/scientific-meetings-need-more-bloggers" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Scientific meetings need more bloggers</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/05/17/scientific-meetings-need-more-bloggers">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/05/17/scientific-meetings-need-more-bloggers?</strong>)</span></a>).</p>
<p>I participated in a wonderful SynchroBlogging effort on April Fools Day (organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Jonathan Eisen</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/?</strong>)</span></a> and with “help” from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://homepage.mac.com/jonathan_eisen/Wabda/Wabda.html" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>World Anti-Brain Doping Authority</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://homepage.mac.com/jonathan_eisen/Wabda/Wabda.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://homepage.mac.com/jonathan_eisen/Wabda/Wabda.html?</strong>)</span></a>) with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/01/what-can-erythopoetin-do-for-you" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>What can Erythopoetin do for you?</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/01/what-can-erythopoetin-do-for-you">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/01/what-can-erythopoetin-do-for-you?</strong>)</span></a>. I think we should do more SynchroBlogging, and not just on April 1st. <strong>Public Access Week</strong> was another SynchroBlogging effort and I learned a lot about access to my own papers in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/11/public-access-week-who-could-read-my-papers" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Public Access Week: Who could read my papers?</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/11/public-access-week-who-could-read-my-papers">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/11/public-access-week-who-could-read-my-papers?</strong>)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Only two blog posts are about scientific research. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/02/07/using-rna-interference-to-identify-genes-that-protect-from-cancer" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Using RNAinterference to identify genes that protect from cancer</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/02/07/using-rna-interference-to-identify-genes-that-protect-from-cancer">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/02/07/using-rna-interference-to-identify-genes-that-protect-from-cancer?</strong>)</span></a> was my contribution to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.justscience.net/2008/?page_id=1368" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Just Science 2008</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.justscience.net/2008/?page_id=1368">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.justscience.net/2008/?page_id=1368?</strong>)</span></a>.

<p>Thanks to this blog I have met a number of very interesting and intelligent people with similar interests (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/eurotrip_08_berlin_part_iii_we.php" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>this blog entry</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/eurotrip_08_berlin_part_iii_we.php">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/05/eurotrip_08_berlin_part_iii_we.php?</strong>)</span></a> by Bora Zivkovic and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/london/news/blog/matt/2008/07/12/dinner-with-the-nobel-prize-winners" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>this blog entry</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/london/news/blog/matt/2008/07/12/dinner-with-the-nobel-prize-winners">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/london/news/blog/matt/2008/07/12/dinner-with-the-nobel-prize-winners?</strong>)</span></a> by Matt Brown). That’s why I’m very much looking forward to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Science Blogging 2008: London</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html?</strong>)</span></a> conference at the end of this month. My goal for the next year: help to make reading and writing science blogs part of the everyday life at more universities and reseach institutions.</p>
