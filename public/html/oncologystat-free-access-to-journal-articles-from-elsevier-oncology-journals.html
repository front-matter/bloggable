<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101437/http://www.oncologystat.com/">OncologySTAT</a> is a new (it launched September 7) web portal by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101437/http://http//us.elsevierhealth.com/">Reed Elsevier</a> that offers, among many other things, full access to journal articles in Elsevier oncology journals.</p>
<p>Elsevier hopes to generate enough revenue from selling advertising on the web site to compensate for (potentially) lost journal sales. This approach has long become a business model for many newspapers and magazines, but I haven't seen this before in scientific and medical publishing.</p>
<p>As I work in the field of oncology, I will have a closer look at OncologySTAT in the coming weeks.</p>
