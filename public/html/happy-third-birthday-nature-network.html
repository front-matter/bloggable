I wasn't around when Nature Network started, but posted by first Gobbledygook blog post (the blog had a different name back then) in August 2007. We passed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031820/http://network.nature.com/people/U6E5B2CE1/blog/2010/01/26/nature-network-blogs-receives-50-000th-comment" data-cite-meta="{}">50.000 comments milestone <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031820/http://network.nature.com/people/U6E5B2CE1/blog/2010/01/26/nature-network-blogs-receives-50-000th-comment">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031820/http://network.nature.com/people/U6E5B2CE1/blog/2010/01/26/nature-network-blogs-receives-50-000th-comment?</strong>)</span></a> just a few weeks ago. And we were told that big changes to the blogging platform underneath are imminent.</p>

<p>I have had many, many positive experiences in these 2 1/2 years. I learned a lot about science publishing and met a large number of very nice and very clever people both online and offline. I wrote about 160 blog posts and an uncounted number of comments during that time, and writing blog posts is still a lot of fun and something I like doing on a regular basis (I decided a while ago to aim for one blog post per week). I am also excited about the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031820/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Science Online London 2010 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031820/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031820/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/?</strong>)</span></a> meeting, although the exact date and location have not yet been set.</p>
<p>Happy birthday.</p>
