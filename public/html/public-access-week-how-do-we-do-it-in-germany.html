<p>Starting this week, papers submitted from NIH-funded research have to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">made publicly available</a> no later than 12 months after publication. But what is the current situation in Germany, especially mandatory Open Access?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://oa.mpg.de/openaccess-berlin/berlindeclaration.html">Berlin Declaration</a> from October 2003 was a strong statement of support for Open Access and was signed by all major research and funding organizations, including <em><em>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</em></em>, <em><em>Max Planck Gesellschaft (MPG)</em></em>, <em><em>Helmholtz-Gesellschaft</em></em>, <em><em>Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft</em></em> and <em><em>Leibniz-Gemeinschaft</em></em>. In contrast to the new NIH public access policy (and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Open-access/Policy/index.htm">Welcome Trust</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.hhmi.org/about/research/journals/main?action=search">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>), there is no mandatory Open Access in any of these organizations.</p>
<p>The German Publisher <em><em>Springer</em></em>, one of the largest STM (Science, Technology and Medicine) publishers, has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110754/http://www.springer.com/open+choice?SGWID=0-40359-0-0-0">Springer Open Choice</a> option. Authors who pay for this option will retain the copyright of their paper and the article will be made available with full Open Access.</p>
