<p>This is my last post for this Nature Network blog. Later today, I will start a new blog somewhere else – also called Gobbledygook and covering the same topics.</p>
<p>Writing this blog here on Nature Network since August 2007 has been an incredible experience, something that can't be covered in a single blog post. I simply want to say thank you to all the people I interacted with over the years – both online and in person. And a particular thanks for Matt, Corie, Anna and Lou from Nature Network who made all this possible.</p>

<p>There are several of my posts I particularly like – and some I like a little less. Something I really enjoyed doing – and something that I think works very well in the blog format – is interviews. I did around 20 interviews in the last two years (the last two on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055619/http://lindau.nature.com/">Lindau Laureate Meeting</a> blog), and I've listed them all below.</p>
