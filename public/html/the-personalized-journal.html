<p>Earlier this week I wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234447/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/02/09/more-tweets-more-citations/">guest post</a> for the <strong>Impact of Social Sciences</strong> blog. In the post I talk about a recent paper correlating tweets and citations (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026234447/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">also discussed on this blog</a>). But the main argument I try to make is that tweets are a powerful filter for personalized scholarly content:</p>
