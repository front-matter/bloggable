<p>I recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101340/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/09/09/could-you-write-your-next-paper-with-google-docs">wrote about</a> the potential of Google Docs and Zoho Writer als online writing tools for scientists. <em><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101340/http://www.virtub.com/">Buzzword</a></em></em> is another web-based writing tool and last week was opened for new users. Buzzword is different, because it is based on Adobe Flash, which makes for a much nicer user interface.</p>
<p>As expected, Buzzword doesn't handle references as flexible as Microsoft Word. But you can at least get similar functionality with endnotes. I expect many small changes before version 1.0, most importantly support for the Symbol font.</p>
<p>You should give Buzzword a try if online document sharing with a slick user interface is important to you.</p>
