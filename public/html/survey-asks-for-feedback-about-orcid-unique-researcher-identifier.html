<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</a> initiative for unique researcher identifiers yesterday started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://survey.euro.confirmit.com/wix/p501806648.aspx">survey</a> that everybody interested in ORCID should fill out.</p>

<p>The survey asks questions about the main services that users expect from ORCID, and how the ORCID service should be paid for (e.g. membership fees or fee-for service).</p>
<p>In quick response to the announcement of the survey on Twitter, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://friendfeed.com/researchremix/d5611278/rt-orcid_org-please-help-us-move-orcid-forward">interesting discussion</a> started on <strong><strong>FriendFeed</strong></strong>. Several commenters were worried that ORCID tries to be too much. Their thoughts were nicely summarized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://twitter.com/#!/CameronNeylon/status/27158241887">this tweet</a> by <strong><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>Agree with @ReaderMeter + @mrgunn: @ORCID_Org will be a success when it does amazing things for me and I barely notice itâ€™s there.</em></em>
</blockquote>
<p>The survey is open until October 28, the results will be reported in November.</p>
