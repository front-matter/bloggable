<p>Last Tuesday <em><em>Nucleic Acids Research</em></em> published a nice paper describing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/" data-cite-meta="{}">UK PubMed Central <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/?</strong>)</span></a> (UKPMC) database (McEntyre 2010). UKPMC was started in 2007, the enhanced version described in the paper was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=14754" data-cite-meta="{}">launched January 2010 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=14754">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=14754?</strong>)</span></a>. In November 2009 I published an <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org//uk_pubmed_central_interview_with_phil_vaughan/" data-cite-meta="{}">interview with Phil Vaughan <span class="citation" data-cites="https://blog.martinfenner.org//uk_pubmed_central_interview_with_phil_vaughan/">(<strong>https://blog.martinfenner.org//uk_pubmed_central_interview_with_phil_vaughan/?</strong>)</span></a>, the senior author of the paper. The paper talks about the specific enhancements done to PubMed Central, including an integrated search of PubMed and PubMed Central, “Cited by information” and semantically enriched content generated by text mining.</p>

<p>Thanks to Duncan Hull we know that PubMed currently contains information about 20 million papers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://duncan.hull.name/2010/07/27/pubmed-20-million/" data-cite-meta="{}">Twenty million papers in PubMed: a triumph or a tragedy? <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://duncan.hull.name/2010/07/27/pubmed-20-million/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://duncan.hull.name/2010/07/27/pubmed-20-million/?</strong>)</span></a>). About 10% of these papers are available as fulltext from PubMed Central. What wasn’t clear to me and what I learned from the paper is that only 194,000 papers, or 1% of PubMed content, are from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/openftlist.html" data-cite-meta="{}">PMC Open Access Subset <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/openftlist.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/openftlist.html?</strong>)</span></a> (and that includes papers with a non-commercial OA license).
