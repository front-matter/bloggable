One of several articles talking about the problem of disambiguation of author names (especially Asian author names) appeared in <em><em>Nature News</em></em> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/451766a" data-cite-meta="{}">February 2008 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/451766a">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/451766a?</strong>)</span></a>. A December 2009 <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a" data-cite-meta="{}">editorial <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a?</strong>)</span></a> emphasized that a unique identifier for researchers will be especially valuable to track scientific contributions that are not related to authoring a paper. Phil Bourne and J. Lynne Fink also wrote about this in PLoS Computational Biology in December 2008: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000247" data-cite-meta="{}">I Am Not a Scientist, I Am a Number <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000247">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000247?</strong>)</span></a>. A number of tools have tried to solve this problem, but it is not possible to link the researcher identities in the many systems.</p>

He emphasized that ORCID is about <em><em>Knowledge Discovery</em></em> and not <em><em>Access Control</em></em>, and explained the terminology for <em><em>subject</em></em>, <em><em>identifier</em></em>, <em><em>profile</em></em>, <em><em>persona</em></em> and <em><em>credential</em></em>. <em><em>Access Control</em></em> is a related problem that is sometimes mixed in, but there is no requirement that a unique researcher identifier also has to provide secure access via whatever mechanism (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/" data-cite-meta="{}">Open ID <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/?</strong>)</span></a> is one solution to that problem).</p>
<h3 id="3-win-support-of-stakeholders">3. Win support of stakeholders</h3>
<p>Founding members of the ORCID initiative can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/orcid/gallery.html" data-cite-meta="{}">found on the ORCID homepage <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/orcid/gallery.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://science.thomsonreuters.com/orcid/gallery.html?</strong>)</span></a> and include publishers, funders, universities, organizations and software companies. A number of important stakeholders are already part of the initiative, support by more funders (besides the Wellcome Trust) and software companies (particularly those that build reference managers or social networking sites for scientists) would be great. Probably the biggest name not on the list is the U.S. National Library of Medicine that runs the <em><em>PubMed</em></em> database of biomedical literature (the ORCID members Wellcome Trust and British Library are involved in UK PubMed Central).</p>
<h3 id="4-make-decisions-about-the-general-design-of-the-system">4. Make decisions about the general design of the system</h3>
<p>Some of the design decisions obviously are not set in stone at this stage. One continuing discussion is <em><em>centralized vs. federated</em></em>, and it looks like ORCID will be a centralized system similar to the DOI. Geoff Bilder has some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder" data-cite-meta="{}">good arguments <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder?</strong>)</span></a> for a centralized system. Another recurring theme is <em><em>how much control an individual researcher has</em></em> over his ORCID record. Although external assertion from publishers or funders will certainly be part of ORCID, the individual researcher will have an important role, not only because of privacy concerns, but also because this is the easiest way to fix errors that even the best automated algorithms for author assignment will produce. And it looks as if ORCID will be an extensible system that will for example allow publishers or social networking sites to add functionality they require. The discussion at the STM Innovations meeting in early December touches some of these issues and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://river-valley.tv/how-researcherid-will-resolve-name-ambiguity-in-the-scholarly-ecosystem/" data-cite-meta="{}">recorded as video <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://river-valley.tv/how-researcherid-will-resolve-name-ambiguity-in-the-scholarly-ecosystem/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://river-valley.tv/how-researcherid-will-resolve-name-ambiguity-in-the-scholarly-ecosystem/?</strong>)</span></a> (after the talk by David Kochalko).</p>
<h3 id="5-pick-a-name">5. Pick a name</h3>
<p>The name <em><em>Open Researcher and Contributor ID</em></em> (ORCID) is obviously a combination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.researcherid.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">ResearcherID <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.researcherid.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.researcherid.com/?</strong>)</span></a> (Thomson Reuters) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Bilder_CrossRef_Contributor_ID.pdf" data-cite-meta="{}">Contributor ID <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Bilder_CrossRef_Contributor_ID.pdf">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Bilder_CrossRef_Contributor_ID.pdf?</strong>)</span></a> (CrossRef). I would have preferred a simpler name, but I guess we have to get used to ORCID.</p>
<h3 id="6-build-on-available-tools">6. Build on available tools</h3>
<p>ORCID will be based on the ResearcherID software from Thomson Reuters. From what I’ve seen, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/" data-cite-meta="{}">Open ID <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/?</strong>)</span></a> system will not be a central part of ORCID. But ORCID certainly will be designed to work together with Open ID and other authentication mechanisms. I don’t know what Elsevier and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Weertman_Taking_the_guesswork_out_of_author_searching.pdf" data-cite-meta="{}">Scopus Author ID <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Weertman_Taking_the_guesswork_out_of_author_searching.pdf">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Weertman_Taking_the_guesswork_out_of_author_searching.pdf?</strong>)</span></a> will contribute to ORCID.</p>
<h3 id="7-form-an-independent-organization">7. Form an independent organization</h3>
<p>In order to be adopted widely, ORCID must be run by an independent organization, and not by a single publisher, software company, research organization or funder. With the experience of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder" data-cite-meta="{}">running the DOI system <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder?</strong>)</span></a> to identify digital objects such as scientific papers, CrossRef would be one obvious candidate, but the ORCID founding members have yet to decide on that.</p>
<h3 id="8-secure-financing">8. Secure financing</h3>
<p>Starting and maintaining ORCID will obviously cost money. In my little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/04/26/a-few-questions-about-author-identifiers-the-answers" data-cite-meta="{}">survey about author identifiers back in April 2009 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/04/26/a-few-questions-about-author-identifiers-the-answers">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/04/26/a-few-questions-about-author-identifiers-the-answers?</strong>)</span></a>, the opinions were split about who should pay for this. Journal publishers and database maintainers (referring to such databases as PubMed, Scopus or Web of Science) were the two most common answers. ORCID will make it easier for funding agencies to evaluate scientists and they might therefore also contribute to the system. Individual researchers hopefully will not have to pay for any of this, but their input in time is obviously required.</p>
<h3 id="9-promote-orcid">9. Promote ORCID</h3>
<p>A <em><em>Nature</em></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a" data-cite-meta="{}">editorial <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a?</strong>)</span></a> in December was a good start to promote ORCID to a wider audience. A unique identifier for scientists will only become accepted if widely used. That’s why it is important that publishers and funders quickly adopt this service. Software companies that build interesting tools around ORCID are also critical, e.g. integration of ORCID into manuscript submission systems (including the use of ORCID for the peer reviewers) and social networking sites (including of course Nature Network). My experience with the DOI for papers (e.g. the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/11/thoughts-on-the-pubmed-redesign" data-cite-meta="{}">limited support in PubMed <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/11/thoughts-on-the-pubmed-redesign">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/11/thoughts-on-the-pubmed-redesign?</strong>)</span></a>) tells me that adoption of ORCID will be a long process.</p>
<h3 id="10-involve-individual-researchers">10. Involve individual researchers</h3>
<p>Individual researchers currently have no way to get directly involved in ORCID. But some level of involvement is critical for an author identifier to work. The best place is currently probably the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1807278" data-cite-meta="{}">LinkedIn Group <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1807278">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1807278?</strong>)</span></a> Unique Identifiers for Researchers started by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile" data-cite-meta="{}">Cameron Neylon <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/U42E63119/profile?</strong>)</span></a>.
