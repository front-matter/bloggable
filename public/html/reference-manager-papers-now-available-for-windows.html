<p>Regular readers of this blog know that I’m a big fan of the reference manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235642/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> – three years ago we even had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235642/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/19/papers_for_iphone_released_time_for_more_poetry">poetry contest</a> when the iPhone version was first released. The strength of Papers has always been the very nice user interface, and Papers 2 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235642/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/08/papers-2-the-reference-manager-made-with-love/">released last March</a> was a major update that added many more reference types, collaboration and a word processor plugin.</p>
<p>The first five years Papers has been only available for Mac and iPhone/iPad, but this week mekentosj.com released a pre-release version for Windows. Papers for Windows is a collaboration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235642/http://www.scimatic.com/node/386">Scimatic Software</a>, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235642/http://pfw.mekentosj.com/kb/roadmap/mac-vs-windows-comparison-compatibility">comparison of the Mac and Windows</a> versions is here. A 30 day trial version is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235642/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">available for download</a> from mekentosj.com.</p>
