<p>Practically all papers in high-energy physics (&gt; 90% since the late 1990s) are first published on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ArXiv <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/?</strong>)</span></a> preprint server. Several related disciplines also have a long ArXiv tradition. But ArXiv is also an excellent source of interesting papers about scientific publishing, including this one from last Monday:</p>
<p><strong><strong>Dallmeier-Tiessen S, Darby R, Goerner B, Hyppoelae J, Igo-Kemenes P, Kahn D, et al.</strong></strong> First results of the SOAP project. Open access publishing in 2010. 2010 Oct; Available from: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0506" data-cite-meta="{}">http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0506 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0506">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051257/http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0506?</strong>)</span></a>.</p>
<p>The paper is a comprehensive report on the current state of open access publishing – and deserves a separate blog post. <strong><strong>Salvatore Mele</strong></strong> (one of the coauthors) pointed me to this paper in a very interesting dinner conversation last night.
