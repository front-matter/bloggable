<p>The survey asks questions about the main services that users expect from ORCID, and how the ORCID service should be paid for (e.g. membership fees or fee-for service).</p>
<p>In quick response to the announcement of the survey on Twitter, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://friendfeed.com/researchremix/d5611278/rt-orcid_org-please-help-us-move-orcid-forward" data-cite-meta="{}">interesting discussion <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://friendfeed.com/researchremix/d5611278/rt-orcid_org-please-help-us-move-orcid-forward">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://friendfeed.com/researchremix/d5611278/rt-orcid_org-please-help-us-move-orcid-forward?</strong>)</span></a> started on <strong><strong>FriendFeed</strong></strong>. Several commenters were worried that ORCID tries to be too much. Their thoughts were nicely summarized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://twitter.com/#!/CameronNeylon/status/27158241887" data-cite-meta="{}">this tweet <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://twitter.com/#!/CameronNeylon/status/27158241887">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101013051207/http://twitter.com/#!/CameronNeylon/status/27158241887?</strong>)</span></a> by <strong><strong>Cameron Neylon</strong></strong>:</p>
