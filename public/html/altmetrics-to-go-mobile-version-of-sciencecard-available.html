<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://sciencecard.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">ScienceCard <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://sciencecard.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://sciencecard.org/?</strong>)</span></a> is a web service that collects all scientific articles published by an author and displays their aggregate article-level metrics. Yesterday I added a mobile version to ScienceCard, simply browse to ScienceCard with your mobile phone or go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">http://mobile.sciencecard.org <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/?</strong>)</span></a>. This is a first version based on my work with jQuery Mobile on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/01/04/crowdometer-goes-mobile/" data-cite-meta="{}">CrowdoMeter <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/01/04/crowdometer-goes-mobile/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/01/04/crowdometer-goes-mobile/?</strong>)</span></a>, but I think ScienceCard works really well on a small screen.My ScienceCard looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/mfenner" data-cite-meta="{}">this <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/mfenner">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/mfenner?</strong>)</span></a>. Further down the screen are the articles I have published and the collective metrics of these papers.</p>

<p>Other ScienceCard users have much more impressive metrics, both in traditional citations, and in altmetrics such as PDF downloads of papers published with PLoS:</p>

<p>Metrics of an individual paper (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://doi.org/dm9" data-cite-meta="{}">http://doi.org/dm9 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://doi.org/dm9">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://doi.org/dm9?</strong>)</span></a>), with links to the journal and metrics (e.g. CiteULike bookmarks) look like this:</p>

<p>One idea behind ScienceCard is to make the collection and display of this kind of information as simple as possible. I hope this is another small step in the right direction.</p>
