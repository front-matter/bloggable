<p>Thanks to a lot of hard work both at <strong><strong>Nature Network</strong></strong> and here at <strong><strong>PLoS Blogs</strong></strong>, all blog posts and comments from my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185441/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/">former blog at Nature Network</a> (August 2007 to August 2010) are now also available here. Special thanks go to Lou Woudley and Brian Mossop who made all this happen. There are of course a few formatting glitches here and there, but I will try to fix them over time.</p>
