I've mentioned several times that I like the program and I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053123/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/10/03/interview-with-alexander-griekspoor" data-cite-meta="{}">interviewed <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053123/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/10/03/interview-with-alexander-griekspoor">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053123/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/10/03/interview-with-alexander-griekspoor?</strong>)</span></a> the author Alex Griekspoor back in October.

<p>As a thank you for beta testing the iPhone version, Alex Griekspoor is giving me three copies of Papers for Mac (or rather three serial numbers, Papers can be downloaded and used for 30 days without registration). As I already own Papers, and in the spirit of some recent poetry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053123/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/30/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important-questions-answered-by-34-science-bloggers" data-cite-meta="{}">here on Nature Network <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053123/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/30/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important-questions-answered-by-34-science-bloggers">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053123/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/11/30/why-do-we-blog-and-other-important-questions-answered-by-34-science-bloggers?</strong>)</span></a> (and elsewhere in the blogosphere, answers to question #11), I'm giving these serial numbers away to the best poetry about using the iPhone for finding, reading or writing science papers.
