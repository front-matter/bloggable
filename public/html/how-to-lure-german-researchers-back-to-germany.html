The implied intention is to lure German researchers back to Germany. GAIN project director Katja Simons explains:</p>
<p><em>Many german researchers abroad are highly interested in returning but they need support creating networks and receiving information on career opportunities in Germany. Germany has invested a great deal in their education and is in need of these bright minds and their experience they gained abroad.</em></p>
<p>GAIN is a joint initiative by the <strong>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AvH)</strong>, the <strong>German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)</strong> and the <strong>German Research Foundation (DFG)</strong>. Their 8th annual meeting took place two weeks ago in Boston<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn2" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>2</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn2">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn2?</strong>)</span></a></sup>.

Representatives from business and politics (members of the parliament) were also present.</p>
<p>To get a more personal perspective, I talked to two researchers that attented the meeting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/profile/avmaier" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>Alexander Maier</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/profile/avmaier">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/profile/avmaier?</strong>)</span></a>, a research fellow at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/affiliations/735" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>NIH</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/affiliations/735">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/affiliations/735?</strong>)</span></a>, thinks that the GAIN meeting was a success. Sceptical at the beginning of the conference, he acknowledges that things have changed and that doing reseach in Germany has become much more attractive. The <strong>excellence initiative</strong> by the German Government is one big reason for that change<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn5" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>5</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn5">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn5?</strong>)</span></a></sup>. The most rewarding part of the program for him was the workshop on how to apply for professorhips.</p>
<p>Florian Jaeger, an assistant professor from the University of Rochester (his blog is here<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn6" data-cite-meta="{}"><strong>6</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn6">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn6?</strong>)</span></a></sup>) is on the GAIN advisory board. He also got the impression that the German reseach system is changing, and that</p>
<p><em>Many institutions in Germany seem to be inspired to learn from the positive aspects of the American system (and maybe even to improve on it).</em></p>
<p>But both Alexander and Florian felt that the research environment in Germany is still far from perfect, and the German research organizations should not think that all problems have been solved. Startup grants are often relatively low and junior research groups are usually not as independent as in the United States. And Florian thinks that the research atmosphere – the way people interact and approach problems – is still more stimulating in the United States.</p>
