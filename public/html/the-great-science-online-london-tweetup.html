<p>The 3rd Annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Science Online London Conference <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/?</strong>)</span></a> took place last Friday and Saturday. For me it was again a fantastic event. Matt Brown is collecting all blog posts, pictures, videos, etc. over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/09/05/science-online-london-2010-index-of-blog-posts-videos-photos-and-stuff" data-cite-meta="{}">this Nature Network post <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/09/05/science-online-london-2010-index-of-blog-posts-videos-photos-and-stuff">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/09/05/science-online-london-2010-index-of-blog-posts-videos-photos-and-stuff?</strong>)</span></a>. As one of the organizers of the conference (mainly helping with the program) I was pretty nervous, and I have to admit that I didn’t sleep well Thursday and Friday. And much better Saturday.</p>

<p>One important reason to go to a conference is of course to meet the members of your community in real life. It was great to talk to many old friends again, and to meet for the first time in person people I knew from online interactions (Alex Knoll, Brian Mossop, David Dobbs, Matt Cockerill, Jen Mellinn, William Gunn and Jim Caryl and many others not mentioned here). Of course I also missed several friends that came to the first two conferences.</p>
<p>Of the many impressions of the conference I want to focus on one: <strong><strong>Twitter</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Twitter has of course become a mainstream tool to follow conferences. Microblogging for the 2008 conference happened mainly on FriendFeed (the much better tool for conference microblogging and described in this <em><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263" data-cite-meta="{&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;1553-7358&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,23]]},&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Saunders&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Neil&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Beltrão&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Pedro&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jensen&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lars&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jurczak&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Daniel&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Krause&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Roland&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Kuhn&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Michael&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Wu&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Shirley&quot;}],&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;PLoS Computational Biology&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2009,1]]},&quot;page&quot;:&quot;e1000263&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Microblogging the ISMB: A New Approach to Conference Reporting&quot;,&quot;title-short&quot;:&quot;Microblogging the ISMB&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;5&quot;}">PLoS Comp Biol <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">(Saunders et al., 2009)</span></a></em></em> paper).

People not attending the conference were starting to drop in the conversation.

Also interesting: more than 700 people used the #solo10 hashtag in their tweets, even though the conference had only 250 attendees (at least 140 of them with Twitter accounts, listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://twitter.com/LouWoodley/solo10-attendees" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://twitter.com/LouWoodley/solo10-attendees">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://twitter.com/LouWoodley/solo10-attendees?</strong>)</span></a>).

<p>Twitter several times was also mentioned as an important discovery tool, and I agree that it has become of the best tools to discover interesting stuff, blog posts, papers, etc. I couldn’t attend the <strong><strong>Recommendation Tools for Scientists</strong></strong> session (with Kevin Emamy and Jason Hoyt), so I don’t know whether Twitter as recommendation tool was discussed there.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to do a more detailed analysis of the #solo10 tweets, e.g. by analyzing which sessions were the most tweeted, what were the most popular keywords and links, or by categorizing tweets into different categories. This could make an interesting session at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/2011_Program_Suggestions" data-cite-meta="{}">ScienceOnline2011 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/2011_Program_Suggestions">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/2011_Program_Suggestions?</strong>)</span></a> Conference next January – of course using some of the cool data visualization tricks that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.davidmccandless.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">David McCandless <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.davidmccandless.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.davidmccandless.com/?</strong>)</span></a> showed us in his session.</p>
