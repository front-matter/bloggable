<p>Reference management is a frequent topic on this blog. The last few
years we have seen both a large increase in the number of

we use reference management software</ext-link>. But for many of us the
first reference management software was Endnote.</p>
<p>I first used Endnote as a medical student in 1990 (Endnote Plus at
that time, published by Niles Software), and I’m still a regular user. I
can’t say that for many other programs (probably also Microsoft Word,
Excel and Powerpoint, Adobe Photoshop, SPSS and until recently
Freehand). The latest version – Endnote X4 – was just released/is about
to be released (Windows in June, Macintosh in August). This is a good
opportunity to look at how Endnote has changed over the years and why it
is still such a popular application. For this I interviewed
<italic><italic>Jason Rollins</italic></italic>, who is leading the
Endnote development team.</p>

  <title>1. What is EndNote?</title>
  <p>Researchers around the world depend on EndNote to simplify
  collaboration, reference collection, and bibliography formatting. It
  is these researchers who have molded the EndNote you see today,
  allowing us to address the pain points as technology evolves. While
  EndNote originated on the Macintosh and Windows desktops, users now
  have the added combination of the Web where they can transfer
  reference groups and share them with colleagues easily. EndNote
  connects to many parts of the research landscape including online
  resources for both basic bibliographic information and full text, word
  processors,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.researcherid.com/">ResearcherID</ext-link>
  for uniquely identifying personal works that will dovetail into the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>
  initiative as well as decreasing time to publish when submitting
  EndNote formatted documents into publishing systems.</p>

<sec id="2-how-is-endnote-different-from-other-reference-managers">
  <title>2. How is EndNote different from other reference
  managers?</title>
  <p>EndNote defined reference management software for generations of
  researchers and continues to offer the highest quality formatting
  available in any tool. Today some variation of the core functionality
  – searching, organizing, sharing, and citing of scholarly reference
  material – is available in many competing tools.</p>
  <p>Two key differences between EndNote and other reference management
  tools include gathering and formatting references. First, EndNote is
  far more accurate and flexible when it comes to the variety of
  publishing styles it supports. EndNote not only provides
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/support/enstyles.asp">over
  4,500 formatting styles</ext-link> but it also allows for the most
  control and customization of this formatting. Our EndNote team works
  closely with leading publishers and editors across many academic
  disciplines to ensure that EndNote offers the formatting control our
  users need to meet exacting publisher specifications. Most of the
  power of this formatting is built-in and achieved automatically by
  EndNote – without the user having to think about it. Of course there
  are many customization options too; these allow users to easily make
  changes and tweaks to the way EndNote formats citations, footnotes,
  and bibliographies.</p>
  <p>Second, EndNote offers the best options for easy import and export
  of user data. The Online Search, Find Full Text, importing, and Web
  capture options are all features that make it easy to obtain accurate
  bibliographic information and manage full text data in EndNote. The
  “RIS Tagged Data” format has become a de facto standard for hundreds
  of databases and software tools. Plus, the EndNote XML specification
  is something that is openly shared with partners and competitors alike
  in hopes of making it easier for our customers to move their data into
  and out of any system they may need to use.</p>

  <title>3. What is new in EndNote X4?</title>
  <p>There’s a
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/enx4wnvid/Whats_New-SD.asp">longer
  list of new and improved features</ext-link>, but a few of the key
  features are new PDF functions, better support for collaborative
  writing and more robust footnote handling.</p>
  <fig>
    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/endnote_screenshot.jpg" xlink:title="" />
  </fig>
  <p>EndNote X4 can create records from PDFs using metadata and a DOI,
  attaching the original file to the newly created reference. Then, PDFs
  are further incorporated into users’ libraries by indexing the
  attached files and making them searchable along with the reference
  data.</p>
  <p>The connection between EndNote and a word processor is more visible
  by incorporating cited references from documents right into the
  EndNote interface. This way, users can work with their references in a
  word processor, and focus on the references in a particular paper
  while managing things in EndNote. Editing and managing individual
  citations in Word now combines all the functionality in one place
  which is a big help for people working on large projects, or
  collaboratively. The “Traveling Library” sharing feature in Word has
  also been significantly improved to help people work together. The APA
  6th style is fully supported and EndNote X4 offers much more
  customization and intelligence to the way footnote formatting styles
  are handled.</p>
  <p>The full list of features, online videos, and a free trial version
  of EndNote X4 are available at
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnote.com/">www.endnote.com</ext-link>.
  EndNote version X4 was released in June for Windows with the Macintosh
  version available by the end of this summer.</p>

  <title>4. How does EndNote handle PDF management? Can you share PDF
  files with other users?</title>
  <p>With version X4, we have added more PDF-related functionality to
  EndNote. Now, you can import PDF meta-data and search the full text of
  attached PDF files. You can share EndNote library files that contain
  PDF attachments easily – or any other file type. EndNote Web does not
  currently support direct file attachments but this is something we are
  currently working on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="5-what-is-endnote-web-how-does-it-relate-to-endnote">
  <title>5. What is EndNote Web, how does it relate to EndNote?</title>
  <p>EndNote provides
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201927/http://www.endnoteweb.com/">EndNote
  Web</ext-link> to users for easy sharing and collaboration features.
  Transferring references up to the web provides extra flexibility to
  work with EndNote references anywhere. There’s a browser plug-in
  available with EndNote Web, that captures and saves references from
  web pages and allows users to send references to a desktop or
  web-based library. The web version has some features that the desktop
  doesn’t, and vice versa; each is complimentary to the other. EndNote
  Web is also integrated into the Web of Knowledge database platform and
  a limited version of EndNote Web is provided to ResearcherID users for
  managing their personal publication list.</p>
