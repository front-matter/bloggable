<p>Just four weeks ago I wrote a blog post titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2010/01/10/how-do-you-read-papers-2010-will-be-different" data-cite-meta="{}">How do you read papers? 2010 will be different <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2010/01/10/how-do-you-read-papers-2010-will-be-different">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2010/01/10/how-do-you-read-papers-2010-will-be-different?</strong>)</span></a>. Not only have we since seen the announcement of the Apple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.apple.com/ipad/" data-cite-meta="{}">iPad <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.apple.com/ipad/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.apple.com/ipad/?</strong>)</span></a>, but last Monday the free Nature.com iPhone app was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html" data-cite-meta="{}">launched <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html?</strong>)</span></a>. The application gives access to the full text of all <em><em>Nature</em></em> and <em><em>Nature News</em></em> content (through until 30 April 2010, how access is handled afterwards hasn't been announced yet). A version for the <em><em>Android</em></em> platform was promised for April, and the app will work with the just-announced <em><em>iPad</em></em>. I included a few screenshots for those without an iPhone or iPod Touch. A free Nature.com personal account is needed to use the app.</p>

<p>The iPhone app doesn't use HTML or PDF but rather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html" data-cite-meta="{}">the ePub format <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html?</strong>)</span></a>. The Nature.com website will soon offer downloads in ePub format (an example article is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/article.epub" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/article.epub">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/article.epub?</strong>)</span></a>). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/" data-cite-meta="{}">Adobe Digital Editions <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.lexcycle.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Stanza <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.lexcycle.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.lexcycle.com/?</strong>)</span></a> are examples of ePub readers. In contrast to PDF, ePub adapts to the screen size and is therefore a much better format for the iPhone.</p>

<p>References are links in the text, clicking on them opens a new window.</p>

</figure>
<p>Figures are also links in the text that open in a new window. The figures can be saved to the iPhone Photos application.</p>

</figure>
<p>The iPhone app also gives access to the full text of <em><em>Nature News</em></em>. In contrast to <em><em>Nature</em></em> papers, images are rendered within the text.</p>

<p><em><em>Nature</em></em> and <em><em>Nature News</em></em> content, as well as PubMed search results can be saved for later reading. This content (or rather the <em><em>DOI</em></em>) is also available from the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/mobileapps/web/bookmarks" data-cite-meta="{}">Nature.com mobile apps <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/mobileapps/web/bookmarks">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/mobileapps/web/bookmarks?</strong>)</span></a> page. Because the <em><em>Nature.com mobile apps</em></em> page stores only the <em><em>DOI</em></em>, a <em><em>Nature</em></em> subscription is required to access the full-text article from there. From the <em><em>Nature.com mobile apps</em></em> page you can also export the citation in <em><em>RIS</em></em> format.</p>
<p>The Nature.com iPhone app also searches both Nature.com and PubMed. Regular searches can be saved.</p>

<p>PubMed searches will retrieve abstracts, with a link to the full-text article via the <em><em>DOI</em></em>.</p>

You can also search for the latest <em><em>Nature</em></em> content, but the fulltext content is available only with a subscription and only as HTML or PDF.</p>

<p>Support for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.web-books.com/Publishing/epub.htm" data-cite-meta="{}">ePub <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.web-books.com/Publishing/epub.htm">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.web-books.com/Publishing/epub.htm?</strong>)</span></a> is the most exiting feature for me, as it opens the door for many interesting mobile applications. I hope that more scientific journals will start to use the format (Hindawi was one of the first publishers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html" data-cite-meta="{}">to support ePub <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html?</strong>)</span></a>), and that we then start to see mobile apps for more than a single journal.</p>
