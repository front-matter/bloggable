In the paper Natasha de Vere <em>et al.</em> describe a DNA barcode resource that covers the 1143 native Welsh flowering plants and conifers.</p>
<p>My new job as technical lead for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">PLoS Article Level Metrics (ALM) project <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/?</strong>)</span></a> involves thinking about how we can best display the ALM collected for this and other papers. We want these ALM to tell us something important and/or interesting, and it doesn’t hurt if the information is displayed in a visually appealing way. There are many different ways this can be done, but here I want to focus on <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>CiteULike</strong>, the only two data sources where PLoS is currently storing every single event (tweet or CiteULike bookmark) with a date. Usage data (HTML and XML views, PDF downloads) are aggregated on a monthly basis, and PLoS doesn’t store the publication dates of citations.</p>
<p>We know from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/" data-cite-meta="{}">work of Gunter Eysenbach <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/?</strong>)</span></a> and others that most tweets linking to scholarly papers are written in the first few days after publication. It therefore makes sense to display this information on a timeline covering the first 30 days after publication, and the tweets about the de Vere paper follow the same pattern.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I like the simplicity of sparklines. It would be interesting to also map the 274 Facebook <strong>Likes, Comments</strong> and <strong>Shares</strong>, but we don’t have date information for them. The same is true for the 9 Mendeley readers and groups.</p>
<p>Another way to display the time course of tweets (or bookmarks) is to use a calendar heat map (the paper was published June 6).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2012/07/calendarPlot.png" title="calendarPlot" class="kg-image" />
</figure>
<p>The chart looks a little bit empty, a calendar heat map probably works better for information with many daily data points. I would appreciate feedback on how these visualizations can be improved.</p>
