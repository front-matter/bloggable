<p>This has been another week working on visualizations. I have summarized some of the results in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528080207/http://api.plos.org/2012/07/20/example-visualizations-using-the-plos-search-and-alm-apis/" data-cite-meta="{}">blog post <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528080207/http://api.plos.org/2012/07/20/example-visualizations-using-the-plos-search-and-alm-apis/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20160528080207/http://api.plos.org/2012/07/20/example-visualizations-using-the-plos-search-and-alm-apis/?</strong>)</span></a> over at the PLoS API website. One of my current favorites is the dot chart.

<p>On Wednesday I gave a presentation about Article-Level Metrics, using many of the same visualizations. You can find the slides over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528080207/https://speakerdeck.com/u/mfenner/p/article-level-metrics" data-cite-meta="{}">Speaker Deck <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528080207/https://speakerdeck.com/u/mfenner/p/article-level-metrics">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20160528080207/https://speakerdeck.com/u/mfenner/p/article-level-metrics?</strong>)</span></a> (my new favorite to upload presentation slides).</p>
