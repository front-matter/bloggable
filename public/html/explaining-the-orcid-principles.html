<p>On Monday I gave a presentation about ORCID, based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610125808/http://www.orcid.org/principles">ORCID Principles</a>. The slides are hopefully a good introduction to ORCID and the current status of the initiative.</p>

<p>A good in-person update of the ORCID initiative is the next ORCID Participant Meeting that takes place May 18 in Boston. Registration is free and everybody interested in unique identifiers for scholarly authors is invited to attend. More information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610125808/http://www.orcid.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&amp;id=1">at the ORCID website</a>.</p>
