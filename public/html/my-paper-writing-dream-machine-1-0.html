<p>Iâ€™ve written a similar post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/03/31/pubmed-and-other-annoyances-in-the-paper-writing-process"><strong>before</strong></a>, put I would like to talk about some of the features that I would like to see in an ideal paper writing application.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent Formatting</strong><br />
Content and formatting should be separated from each other. A manuscript should require as little formatting as possible, and that formatting (including the format of references) should be defined in a Journal style that is automatically applied to the manuscript. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.wolfram.com/products/publicon/index.html"><strong>Publicon</strong></a> by Wolfram Research tried to achieve this, but unfortunately appears to be a dead product.</p>
<p><strong>References</strong><br />
A reference database should be integrated into the paper writing application. Ideally this would be a web-based database such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.connotea.org/"><strong>Connotea</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.citeulike.org/"><strong>CiteULike</strong></a>. Both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.refworks.com/"><strong>Refworks</strong></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.endnoteweb.com/enwebinfo.asp"><strong>EndNote Web</strong></a> already offer some level of integration.</p>
<p><strong>Versioning</strong><br />
Storing all versions of a manuscript is very important for obvious reasons: backup, keeping track of revisions and coordinating the input from more than one author. Version control is standard practice in software development, using tools like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://subversion.tigris.org/"><strong>Subversion</strong></a> or the newer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://git.or.cz/index.html"><strong>Git</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with Online Submission Systems</strong><br />
Submitting a manuscript to an online manuscript submission system such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/home.htm"><strong>EditorialManager</strong></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.topazproject.org/trac/"><strong>Topaz</strong></a> is too complicated. This process could and should be automated.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
My Paper Writing Dream Machine will in all likelihood turn out to be a web-based application, using on one of the more advanced platforms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://gears.google.com/"><strong>Google Gears</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://silverlight.net/"><strong>Microsoft Silverlight</strong></a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.adobe.com/de/products/flex/"><strong>Adobe Flex</strong></a>. And the data will be in XML using a standard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition"><strong>DTD</strong></a>. Some of the pieces of the puzzle already exist, but nobody has yet put them together in a way that it creates a compelling alternative to the currently used systems.</p>
