<p>This Friday and Saturday the <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london2013/">SpotOn London Conference</a> will take place at the British Library in London. I am very excited, as I have come to this conference since the <a href="https://twitter.com/McDawg/status/397068628102610945">first one in 2008</a>, and have helped organize the event since 2009. The conference is about science communication in the broadest sense, and has three strands that focus on <em>science communication, science policy and tools</em>. Equally important as the sessions are of course the many highly engaging informal discussions of the 250 participants that take place between and after the sessions.</p>

<p>SpotOn London sessions are also more conversations than presentations, as they usually have 2-4 panelists with ample time for discussion with the audience. I will take part in two panels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-what-the-hack-part-one-hackdays-session/">What the hack?!</a> (Friday 10:30 AM, hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23solo13hack">#solo13hack</a>), with Peter Murray-Rust, Ross Mounce and Helen Jackson</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-whats-your-number-altmetrics-session/">What’s your number? - Altmetrics session</a> (Saturday 10:30 AM, hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23solo13alt">#solo13alt</a>), with Marie Boran, David Colquhoun, Jean Liu and Stephen Curry</li>
</ul>
<p>I will summarize my thoughts regarding the altmetrics session in another post, but want to talk about the first session in more detail. According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">English Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
A <strong><strong>hackathon</strong></strong> (also known as a <strong><strong>hack day</strong></strong>, <strong><strong>hackfest</strong></strong> or <strong><strong>codefest</strong></strong>) is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects.

<p>It is too bad that we will have no hackathon at year’s SpotOn London for logistical reasons, but the session is a great opportunity to reflect on the value of science hackdays. It is clear that hackdays for scientific software have become popular, with almost too many opportunities to participate.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-like">What I like</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do stuff. And have plenty of time to do stuff instead sessions in short intervals</li>
<li>Hackdays let you do great team work</li>
<li>Learn about other interesting projects and meet people doing cool work</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-i-don-t-like">What I don’t like</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hackdays are very much targeted at intermediate to advanced software developers, and it is sometimes not easy for beginners to participate</li>
<li>Too much time spent setting up stuff</li>
<li>Some of the work done at hackdays can be better done in virtual collaborations over weeks or months</li>
<li>Not many projects make it beyond the hackday and actually turn into a useable product. One example where this is not true are the visualizations started at the ALM 2012 hackathon that were implemented by OJS in 2013 (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v6i0.19283">see article for more</a>), and of course <a href="http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</a> that started at a hackathon at the <a href="http://beyond-impact.org/">Beyond Impact</a> conference in May 2011.</li>

<h3 id="some-of-the-challenges">Some of the challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coming up with projects where progress can be made in a day or two</li>
<li>Technology: WiFi access, access to servers for code deployment, collaboration tools, etc.</li>
<li>Come up with a good unifying theme, so that the various projects during the hackday relate to each other. The theme at <a href="http://hack4ac.com/">#hack4ac</a> was to demonstrate the value of the CC-BY license within academia.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-ideas-to-improve-science-hackdays">Some ideas to improve science hackdays</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go beyond software development. We <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/alm-data-challenge-metrics-for-a-standard-set-of-dois/">recently tried a data challenge using Altmetrics data</a>, and at a <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/02/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">hackathon between IGSN, DataCite, PANGAEA and ORCID in July</a> we focussed on a high-level discussion of technical issues. There is a continuum towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> format, although I don’t like to drift too much from <em>doing</em> to <em>talking</em>. A good example of a workshop open to everyone and not just software developers is the SpotOn London workshop this Saturday on <a href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-wikipedia-editing-workshop/">Wikipedia Editing</a> run by Brian Kelly and Toni Sant.</li>
<li>Meet before and after the hackathon. This can be done online, but it helps to focus on what can be achieved in the limited time available for a hackathon, and to follow up on projects that have just been started. But a hackathon is also a great opportunity to meet new people and new ideas, so meeting afterwards is more important than before.</li>
<li>Involve remote people. A lot of the fun of hackdays comes from sitting around a table and doing something together. But sometimes this is not possible for everyone, so think about remote participation where it makes sense.</li>
</ul>
