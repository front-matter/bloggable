<p>Jason Rollins gave a presentation with that topic at the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=58">STM Innovations Seminar</a> in London. The video of his presentation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://river-valley.tv/new-and-emerging-technologies-for-reference-software/">has now been made available</a> by River Valley TV, and his slides are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2010_12_03_Innovations_Rollins_Bibliographic_Management_Software.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Jason talks about some recent trends in reference management software. For him one important new trend is APIs/extensions. I fully agree with him, but we havenâ€™t really seen many tools based on these APIs. Reference managers that provide APIs include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://dev.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/api/">Endnote</a>, Refworks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://developer.mekentosj.com/">Papers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.zotero.org/blog/zoteros-next-big-step/">Zotero</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.connotea.org/wiki/WebAPI">Connotea</a>. The availability of an API has done a lot for the success of Web 2.0 tools such as Twitter and Flickr.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic was brought up in the discussion: should reference managers track difference versions of an article (e.g. pre-print, post-print, publisher PDF)? According to Jason many Endnote users request this feature. Jason is leading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114551/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> development team, but also mentions Mendeley, CiteULike and Papers in his presentation. I <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/endnote_interview_with_jason_rollins/">interviewed</a> Jason about Endnote back in August.</p>
