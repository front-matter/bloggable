<p>It’s very unusual for me to post two blog posts in a single day, and even more so when both posts are based on press releases by the same organization. But this is important news for everybody interested in scholarly publishing.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html" data-cite-meta="{&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120618155709/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html&quot;,&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2021,2,23]]},&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;web.archive.org&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html&quot;,&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[2012,6]]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Press release archive: About NPG&quot;,&quot;title-short&quot;:&quot;Press release archive&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">press release <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html">(<span>“Press Release Archive,”</span> 2012)</span></a> earlier today, the Nature Publishing Group announced a new journal that</p>
<ul>
<li>is covering biology, chemistry, earth sciences and physics,</li>
<li>is an open access journal, giving the authors the choice of two Creative Commons non-commercial licenses,</li>
<li>will publish all papers that are judged to be technically valid and original, and</li>
<li>uses article-level metrics to put the emphasis on the individual article rather than the journal as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new journal is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html" data-cite-meta="{}"><em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html?</strong>)</span></a>, and obviously resembles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.plosone.org/" data-cite-meta="{}"><em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.plosone.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.plosone.org/?</strong>)</span></a> in many ways, down to the article-processing charges which are $1350 for both journals (but will go up to $1700 for <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> in 2012). The journal is open for submissions and will publish the first papers this summer. With <em><em>Nature</em></em>, <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> (also see my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/11/26/nature_communications_interview_with_lesley_anson/" data-cite-meta="{}">interview <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/11/26/nature_communications_interview_with_lesley_anson/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/11/26/nature_communications_interview_with_lesley_anson/?</strong>)</span></a> with Chief Editor Lesley Anson) and <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> the Nature Publishing Group now publishes three journals covering all areas of the natural sciences.</p>
<p>The launch of <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> is a good sign that <em><em>PLoS ONE</em></em> is doing something right. It will be interesting to watch whether the two journals will only be competitive – they are aiming for the same manuscript submissions – or will also collaborate on projects such as article-level metrics.</p>

<p>In another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/statement.html" data-cite-meta="{}">press release <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/statement.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/statement.html?</strong>)</span></a> today, David Hoole explains the position of the Nature Publishing Group on open access publishing. He argues that journals such as <em><em>Nature</em></em> with a 90% rejection rates are better served by a subscription model, and that he feels that journal submission fees (as discussed in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/" data-cite-meta="{}">recent report <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/?</strong>)</span></a>) are not an attractive option. The press release also mentions that 40% of the content of the hybrid journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/" data-cite-meta="{}">Nature Communications <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/?</strong>)</span></a> is currently open access.</p>
<p>Although I can follow the arguments made in the press release, I disagree that we need different “tiers” of journals. The <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em> FAQ makes it clear that the journal doesn’t expect authors to submit their best works, but rather papers that require “speed of publication”, promise “no conceptual advance in the field” and show “negative results”. Let’s see how authors will respond to this and whether it will be possible 10 years from now to distinguish papers published in <em><em>Nature,</em></em> <em><em>Nature Communications</em></em> and <em><em>Scientific Reports</em></em>.</p>
