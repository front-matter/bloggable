<p>A real Web 2.0 application needs a serious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110207/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_">mashup</a>(web_application_hybrid). At least the folks at ResearcherID thought so. You might <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110207/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/01/21/thomson-scientific-launches-researcherid-to-uniquely-identify-authors">remember</a> that ResearcherID creates a unique author ID for each interested scientist and was launched by Thomson Scientific (recently renamed to Thomson Reuters) earlier this year.</p>
<p>The new ResearcherID features include a mashup with Yahoo Maps that shows the location of your collaborators. Here are some examples from fellow Nature Networkers:</p>

<p>Wentworthville, Australia is the furthest I can go to find a paper coauthor.</p>
<p>Now the really interesting question would be: when do we see mashups with Nature Networkers? For a start we have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110207/http://www.flickr.com/groups/nnl/pool/map?mode=group">Nature Network London Flickr Mashup</a> created by Matt.</p>
