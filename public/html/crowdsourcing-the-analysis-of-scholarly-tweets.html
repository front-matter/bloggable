<p>In December Euan Adie and I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">started the CrowdoMeter projec</a>t, an analysis of the semantic content of tweets linking to scholarly papers. Because classifying almost 500 tweets is a lot of work, we turned this into a crowdsourcing project. We got help from 36 people, who did 953 classifications, and we discussed the preliminary results (available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">here</a>) at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline2012</a> conference.</p>
<p>There is no reason to stop the crowdsourcing here, so we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://hdl.handle.net/10779/01c28ce592291e7e294ed328208a5869">uploaded the result set</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/16/figshare-interview-with-mark-hahnel/">figshare</a> and invite everybody to help us with the data analysis. For this purpose I have created a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer">public repository</a> on Github which contains not only the source code for the CrowdoMeter website, but also all data – the same dataset made available on figshare. I have written a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer/blob/crowdometer/public/assets/shares_author.R">first R script</a> that produces the following pie chart:</p>

<p>The figure doesn’t look all that exciting, but there is some calculation involved. There are different numbers of classifications per tweet and sometimes there is disagreement: true means at least 50% of classifications were true. It would be great if we find people willing to help with data analysis, preferably using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://rstudio.org/">R</a> and contributing their scripts to the Github repository. Please send me an email or contact me <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://twitter.com/#!/mfenner">via Twitter</a> if you need write access to the repository.</p>
