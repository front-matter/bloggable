<p>I did a little experiment to figure out whether the fulltext versions of my last 15 papers (published between 1997-2008) are available online. The result:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 papers available for everybody</li>
<li>10 papers only available from within my institution (Journal subscription required)</li>
<li>2 papers only available for purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the papers in the two journals with the highest impact factor are both available as full-text. And the third full-text paper is my paper with the most citations (and published in 1998).</p>
<p>Conclusion: Not that anyone would care what I have to say, but you have to work in an institution with a good library budget to read my papers.</p>
