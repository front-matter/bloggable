<p>Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/" data-cite-meta="{}">I posted a document <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/?</strong>)</span></a> that should help define a set of principles for scientific attribution. These principles will be presented and discussed at the National Science Foundation workshop <strong><strong>Changing the Conduct of Science in the Information Age</strong></strong> on November 12. Many people helped me with this document (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://cameronneylon.net/" data-cite-meta="{}">Cameron Neylon <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://cameronneylon.net/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191031/http://cameronneylon.net/?</strong>)</span></a> in particular), and I welcome comments and suggestions.</p>
