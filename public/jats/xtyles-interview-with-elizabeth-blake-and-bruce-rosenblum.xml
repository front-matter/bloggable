<p>Scientific papers are submitted to a journal as word processor files,
usually in Microsoft Word format. After the paper is accepted for
publication, the journal takes the manuscript and translates the text
into a format that is better suited for publication online and/or in
print. XML and the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM
DTD</ext-link> – a set of XML schema modules – have evolved as the
standard data format for this purpose. Files in the NLM DTD format can
in turn be translated into HTML and/or PDF for publication. The NLM DTD
format is also used to transfer journal articles from publishers to
archives (e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed
Central</ext-link>) and for long-term archiving.</p>

is a tool that facilitate the translation between these different
document formats, and in the process also help to clean up broken
references and other errors in the manscript. As paper authors usually
don’t see much of what happens to their manuscript after submission, I
thought I’d ask Elizabeth Blake and Bruce Rosenblum from

  <title>2. What is the difference between eXtyles and the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx#Tools">Microsoft
  Word Article Authoring Add-in</ext-link> ?</title>
  <p><italic><italic>Bruce Rosenblum:</italic></italic> eXtyles makes
  two assumptions. First, eXtyles does not rely on the author to
  complete document structuring tasks – in our experience, journals have
  not succeeded in having authors provide sufficiently accurate styling
  or markup in Word files (the application used by most scholarly
  authors) to allow for automatic creation of high-quality XML. Second,
  eXtyles assumes that authors make other kinds of mistakes, whether
  adding inappropriate formatting, using unsupported fonts for special
  characters, or making informational errors in reference lists, and all
  of these problems must be corrected as part of the publishing
  process.</p>
  <p>eXtyles is designed to overcome the limitations of how authors
  commonly prepare manuscripts by providing the tools that publishers
  need to clean up, rapidly edit, and then convert manuscripts to XML.
  eXtyles has been carefully developed over ten years to accurately
  address the reality of what publishers see in author submissions.</p>
  <p>By contrast, the Microsoft Word Article Authoring Add-in has been
  developed as a content creation tool. It is designed for authors to
  structure articles in Word 2007 as they write. In this model, authors
  must add structural information rather than just submit the text of
  their article. The Add-in assumes authors will create reference lists
  with the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164418/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA100674921033.aspx">Word
  2007 citation manager</ext-link> and will adhere to all requirements
  necessary to successfully save the manuscript to NLM DTD XML when they
  have completed writing their article. Also, the Microsoft Add-in does
  not provide tools to prepare an article for XML conversion if the
  Add-in was not used during creation of the article, which is a key
  feature of eXtyles.</p>
  <p>Fundamentally the target audience differs: the Microsoft Add-in
  assumes use by authors, whereas eXtyles provides tools to publishing
  personnel that allow authors to concentrate on great scientific
  research rather than the technical aspects of article publication.</p>

<sec id="3-what-are-the-most-common-problems-in-submitted-manuscripts-that-can-be-fixed-by-extyles-are-there-problems-that-have-to-be-fixed-manually">
  <title>3. What are the most common problems in submitted manuscripts
  that can be fixed by eXtyles? Are there problems that have to be fixed
  manually?</title>
  <p><italic><italic>Elizabeth Blake:</italic></italic> The most common
  problems range from relatively simple issues such as extraneous
  formatting or misapplied styles to more complex issues such as missing
  data or incorrect or uncited references. Hovering in between these are
  violations of editorial style – for example, British versus American
  spelling or non-standard abbreviations for units of measure – which
  eXtyles can also correct.</p>
  <p>Some problems do have to be fixed manually. eXtyles does not take
  the place of an editor; rather, it automates as much of the low-level
  copy editing as can be reliably automated while drawing the editor’s
  attention to issues that require follow up. An example would be
  eXtyles flagging a callout to a table that is missing from the
  manuscript; this obviously requires human intervention, but the
  warning saves time and flags problems early in the workflow when they
  are easier to resolve.</p>
  <p>On a larger scale, the problem eXtyles is designed to solve is
  getting the accepted author manuscript published as quickly and
  accurately as possible. The fully eXtyled file can be flowed into a
  typesetting system such as InDesign with the paragraph styles aligned
  to the composition template, saving a lot of labor during the
  typesetting stage, or the Word file can be converted directly to NLM
  XML with the push of a button, allowing users to create rich, valid
  XML without any XML knowledge or expertise.</p>

  <title>4. eXtyles helps with editorial tasks such as document cleanup
  and citation checking. Why shouldn’t these tasks be left to the
  authors and checked when a manuscript is submitted?</title>
  <p><italic><italic>Elizabeth Blake:</italic></italic> Theoretically
  these tasks are the authors’ responsibility! In practice it is an
  extremely rare manuscript that doesn’t have errors, particularly
  reference errors. Our goal is not to discourage authors from
  submitting clean and accurate manuscripts; our goal is to facilitate
  the process when that doesn’t happen, which is</p>
