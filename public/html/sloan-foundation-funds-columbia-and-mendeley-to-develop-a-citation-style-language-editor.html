CSL is a XML-based language to format citations and bibliographies, and is used by the reference managers Zotero, Mendeley and Papers, and in many other places.

The CSL editor will be made available as open source software.</p>
<p>Building a dedicated CSL editor will be a tremendous boost to the format.
