<p>Around Christmas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law" data-cite-meta="{}">mandatory open access for NIH-funded research <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law?</strong>)</span></a> was signed into law:</p>
<blockquote>
<em><em>The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall require that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for them to the National Library of Medicine</em>'<em>s PubMed Central an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication, to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication: Provided, That the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with copyright law.</em></em>

<p>Starting April 7, the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm" data-cite-meta="{}">NIH Public Access Policy <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm?</strong>)</span></a> implementing this law will take effect for most NIH grantees. The NIH is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-08-060.html" data-cite-meta="{}">soliciting comments <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-08-060.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-08-060.html?</strong>)</span></a> until May 1st for this new policy. Open Access and this new policy are complicated topics that simply can't be covered in a single blog post. This week will certainly see a lot of discussion on this topic, both on Nature Network and elsewhere. Please state your view on the topic either in blog entries or join the discussion in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/1320" data-cite-meta="{}">Publishing in the New Millenium Forum <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/1320">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/1320?</strong>)</span></a>. I will try to summarize (some) of the discussion at the end of this <em><em>Public Access Week</em></em>.</p>
