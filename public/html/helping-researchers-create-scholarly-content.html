<p>Two weeks ago I gave a presentation at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=56" data-cite-meta="{}">STM Annual Conference 2010 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=56">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=56?</strong>)</span></a> in Frankfurt (STM is the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers). I told the audience that publishers could do a much better job helping researchers create digital content – both by providing better tools and by reconsidering licenses for content reuse.</p>
<p>A video of my presentation is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://river-valley.tv/helping-researchers-create-scholarly-content/" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://river-valley.tv/helping-researchers-create-scholarly-content/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://river-valley.tv/helping-researchers-create-scholarly-content/?</strong>)</span></a>.
