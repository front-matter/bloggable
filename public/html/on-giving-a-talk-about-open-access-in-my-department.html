<p>Earlier this month I gave this talk in my department. It is basically a summary of two blog posts that I wrote in October during <strong><strong>Open Access Week</strong></strong> (Open Access Week: a researcher's perspective <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective" data-cite-meta="{}">part I <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective?</strong>)</span></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/23/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective-part-ii" data-cite-meta="{}">part II <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/23/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective-part-ii">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/23/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective-part-ii?</strong>)</span></a>), and I had given a similar talk in November in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=254" data-cite-meta="{}">Open Access workshop <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=254">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=254?</strong>)</span></a> organized by the Helmholtz Association. But because this time my audience (researchers and clinicians in a university hospital) was less knowledgeable about Open Access, I added a few introductory slides in the beginning.</p>
<p>The discussion is usually the most interesting part, and this topic certainly has a lot of material for discussion. Interestingly, we talked mainly about the problem of <strong><strong>copyright</strong></strong>. Even though anybody who has ever submitted a paper to a (non-Open Access) journal has signed a copyright transfer agreement, the implications of this were not really clear to most people in the audience. Reuse of a figure or table in an academic seminar usually falls under <strong><strong>fair use</strong></strong>, but many journals still require a (free) permission.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/13/on_giving_a_talk_about_open_access_in_my_department/#fn1" data-cite-meta="{}">1 <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/13/on_giving_a_talk_about_open_access_in_my_department/#fn1">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/13/on_giving_a_talk_about_open_access_in_my_department/#fn1?</strong>)</span></a></sup> And using the same figure in a medical conference can cost several hundred dollars, and it doesn't really matter that you are one of the authors of the paper (slides 15-17 in the presentation). Some of my colleagues have run into issues with copyright, usually when the talks of a conference were later redistributed on a CD or website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there wasn't enough time to discuss some of the other issues raised in the talk, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why can't our Medical School Library afford an institutional subscription for <em><em>Cell</em></em>?</li>
<li>Why is there no <strong><strong>institutional repository</strong></strong> at our university?</li>
<li>Why is it very unlikely that we will have a mandate for Open Access in Germany in the near future?</li>
<li>Why has the <strong><strong>Impact Factor</strong></strong> become so important in Medicine?</li>
</ul>
<p>The seminar was also interesting in that this was one of the rare occasions where I talked publicly in my department about some of the topics that I regularly write about on this blog. I always felt that most of my colleagues don't really care about these topics, and that they probably think I should rather spend my time working on the next paper or grant. I haven't gotten much feedback after the talk, but maybe I should reconsider that position.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Many journals use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://www.copyright.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Copyright.com <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://www.copyright.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://www.copyright.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, which makes this process straightforward.</p>
