<p>Faculty 1000 today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://f1000research.com/2012/01/30/f1000-research-join-us-and-shape-the-future-of-scholarly-communication-2/">announced</a> <strong>F1000 Research</strong>, <em>a new fully Open Access publishing program across biology and medicine, that will start publishing later this year</em>. The default open access license is CC-BY, and CC0 for data.</p>
<p>Important features include:</p>
<ol>
<li>immediate publication</li>
<li>open, post-publication peer review</li>
<li>revisioning of work</li>
<li>raw data repository</li>
<li>article format and content is not predefined</li>
</ol>
<p>F1000 Research is a <em>publishing program</em> rather than a journal. The format for F1000 Research hasn’t been finalized, and F1000 welcomes comments at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://f1000research.com/">blog</a> or via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/https://twitter.com/#!/F1000Research">Twitter</a> account.</p>
<p>My main question about F1000 Research: is this a preprint archive similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>? I’m a big fan of preprint archives, and I think that – contrary to what most people think – they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/16/in-which-i-suggest-a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials/">should work particularly well</a> for clinical trial data.</p>
<p>Update (1/30/12): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/an-arxiv-for-all-of-science-f1000-launches-new-immediate-publication-journal/">RetractionWatch</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161010225753/http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/01/f1000-launches-fast-open-science-publishing-for-biology-and-medicine.html">Nature News</a> also cover this story.</p>
