<blockquote>
There’s a gap between science and technology, and it’s growing.
</blockquote>
<p>Eva argues that – contrary to popular belief – there is actually a divide between science and technology. Scientists are on average not really comfortable using technology, and many computing tools aimed for scientists really miss the point of what scientists really care about.</p>

<p>As a big fan of using technology for science I am looking forward to what Digital Science will do in the coming months. I am particularly interested in their answer to the questions asked by Eva. Have they found a better way to understand what technologies scientists really want? Or are tools for digital science something that the majority of scientists don’t really care about?</p>
