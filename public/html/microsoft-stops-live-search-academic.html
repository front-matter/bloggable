<p>Microsoft yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102727/http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2008/05/23/book-search-winding-down.aspx">announced</a> on the Live Search Blog that their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102727/http://search.live.com/academic/">Academic Search</a> will be closed next week.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102727/http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> still has shortcomings, including the lack of special limitation features that are found in PubMed. A more detailed comparison of PubMed and Google Scholar can be found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611102727/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=17971893">this paper</a>.</p>
<p>Does this announcement simply reflect a shift in strategy at Microsoft, or is academic search no longer interesting to Microsoft, Google, etc.?</p>
