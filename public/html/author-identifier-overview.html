<p>Today I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611042244/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/author-identifier-overview/">posted the pre-print</a> of a paper titled <strong><strong>Author Identifier Overview</strong></strong> that I submitted to the journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611042244/http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/browsing/libreas/index.php">Libreas</a>. This is the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
Unique identifiers for scholarly authors are still not commonly used, but provide a number of benefits to authors, institutions, publishers, funding organizations and scholarly societies. This report gives an overview about some of the popular author identifier systems, and their characteristics. The report also discusses several important issues that need to be addressed by author identifier systems, namely identity, reputation and trust.
