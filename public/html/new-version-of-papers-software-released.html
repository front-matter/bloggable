<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104710/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> is Macintosh-only software to manage the PDF files of all the scientific papers you stored on your computer. I previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104710/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/5/1/papers-itunes-for-your-scientific-papers">wrote</a> about version 1.0 that appeared earlier this year.The new Version 1.5 is compatible with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104710/http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Leopard</a>, the latest release of the Macintosh operating system. The biggest improvement is support for search engine plugins. With previous versions, only PubMed searches were possible, but now you can also search Google Scholar, Web of Science and others.</p>
<p>Papers is a wonderful piece of software that helps to organize the clutter of PDF files on your hard drive. My wish for version 2.0: integration of RSS feeds from journal table of contents or custom PubMed searches.</p>
