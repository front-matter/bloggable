<p>We have been talking a lot about Web 2.0 approaches for scientific papers. Now Elsevier announced an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://article20.elsevier.com/contest/home.htm">Article 2.0 Contest</a>:</p>
<p><em><em>Demonstrate your best ideas for how scientific research articles should be presented on the web and compete to win great prizes!</em></em></p>
<p>The contest runs from September 1st until December 31st. Elsevier will provide 7.500 full text articles in XML format (through a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> API). The contestants that creates the best article presentation (creativity, value-add, ease of use and quality) will win prizes.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting contest, and I plan to participate. I do know enough about programming web pages that I can create something useful in four months. My development platform of choice is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and Rails has great REST support. I will use the next two months before the contest starts to think about the features I want to implement.</p>
<p>I'm sure that other people are also considering to participate in this contest or would like to make suggestions for features. Please contact me by commenting or via Email or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://friendfeed.com/mfenner">FriendFeed</a>. A great opportunity to not only talk about Science 2.0, but actually do something about it.</p>
