<p>I'm a regular reader of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">TechCrunch <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, a popular blog about internet products and companies. But somehow I missed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/22/2007-in-numbers-igoogle-googles-homegrown-star-performer-this-year/" data-cite-meta="{}">article <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/22/2007-in-numbers-igoogle-googles-homegrown-star-performer-this-year/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/22/2007-in-numbers-igoogle-googles-homegrown-star-performer-this-year/?</strong>)</span></a> just before christmas that talks about the popularity of different Google products. In this analysis, traffic for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scholar.google.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Google Scholar <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scholar.google.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scholar.google.com/?</strong>)</span></a> was down 32% compared to 2006.</p>
<p>I haven't seen this information reproduced somewhere else, but the number for most of the other Google products were higher than 2006, as expected. And I don't have the numbers of searches in Google Scholar compared to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez" data-cite-meta="{}">PubMed <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?</strong>)</span></a> (you would have to buy this information from companies like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.comscore.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">comScore <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.comscore.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.comscore.com/?</strong>)</span></a>). But does this indicate that there is something wrong with Google Scholar? As a PubMed user for 15 years, I still like to get search results chronologically and not by (perceived) relevance. And I like the detailed search options and integration with other databases.</p>
<p>Other search engines in this field include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scirus.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Scirus <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scirus.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scirus.com/?</strong>)</span></a> from Elsevier and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://academic.live.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Windows Live Academic Search <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://academic.live.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://academic.live.com/?</strong>)</span></a> from Microsoft.

<p>Some big company names, but for me Pubmed is still the first stop when searching for journal articles. And PubMed will become more important as the NIH now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law" data-cite-meta="{}">requires <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law?</strong>)</span></a> the deposition of all NIH-funded research papers in PubMed Central.</p>
