<p>This Sunday morning at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">International Congress of Genetics <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/?</strong>)</span></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.botany.ubc.ca/people/griffith.htm" data-cite-meta="{}">Tony Griffiths <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.botany.ubc.ca/people/griffith.htm">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.botany.ubc.ca/people/griffith.htm?</strong>)</span></a> gave an interesting presentation with the above title. He identified 12 possible reasons why students have problems learning genetics. His main argument: students should learn concepts and principles and apply them creatively in novel situations (the <em><em>research mode</em></em>). Instead, too many details are often crammed into seminars and textbooks. In other words, students often stay at the lowest level of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Bloom%27s_Taxonomy" data-cite-meta="{}">Bloom's taxonomy <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Bloom%27s_Taxonomy">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Bloom%27s_Taxonomy?</strong>)</span></a>, the remembering of knowledge. The highest level, the creation of new knowledge, is seldom reached, although these skills are of course critical for a successful researcher.</p>
<p>Andrew Moore from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.embo.org/scisoc/index.html" data-cite-meta="{}">EMBO <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.embo.org/scisoc/index.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.embo.org/scisoc/index.html?</strong>)</span></a> talked about the teaching of genetics in the classroom. He was concerned that a survey found that molecular evolution (or molecular phylogeny) was taught in not more than 30% of European classrooms. He gave some examples of how principles of genetics can be integrated into high school teaching.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Nellen explained his successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.siriuswork.de/sciencebridge.net/tmp/" data-cite-meta="{}">Science Bridge <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.siriuswork.de/sciencebridge.net/tmp/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.siriuswork.de/sciencebridge.net/tmp/?</strong>)</span></a> project of teaching genetics in the classroom, using biology students as teachers. Interestingly, they have not only taught high school students, but also journalists and – priests (German language link <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/artikel/770/134514/" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/artikel/770/134514/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091404/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/artikel/770/134514/?</strong>)</span></a>). Politicians were the only group of people that weren't interested in his offer of a basic science course.</p>
