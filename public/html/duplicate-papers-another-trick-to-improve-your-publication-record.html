<p>Nature today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/451397a">published</a> a report on the prevalence of duplicate papers in Medline. In this report Mounir Errami and Harold Garner estimate that there as many as 200.000 duplicate papers in Medline or 1% of all published papers.</p>
<p>The article has already been widely cited, including of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080123/full/news.2008.520.html">Nature News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/954">Nature Network</a>, but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/science/~3/221820549/something-rotten-in-the-state-of-scientific-publishing">Noble Intent</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DigitalKoans/~3/222411428/">DigitalKoans</a>.</p>
<p>The original paper by Errami and Garner was published in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/243"><em>Bioinformatics</em></a>. They used the search engine eTBLAST to find duplicate papers and deposited the results in a database called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/">Deja Vu</a>. When you search Deja Vu for scientists you know, you find scary results.</p>
<p>Nobody likes duplicate papers, but it's just another trick to improve your publication record. Another popular trick is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n11/full/7401095.html">inflation</a> of paper authors. But the basic trick is still the heavy use of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://chronicle.com/jobs/2004/02/2004020901c.htm">least publishable unit</a> or LPU.</p>
<p>Both authors and journals are inclined to publish as many papers as possible. So what will change these practices? If the quality of the work of a scientist isn't simply measured by numerical indices such as number of publications. So it's up to those that decide about grants and jobs to find a better way to pick up the best scientists.</p>
