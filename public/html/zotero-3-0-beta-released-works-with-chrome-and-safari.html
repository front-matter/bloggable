<p>The first beta of the reference manager Zotero 3.0 was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525045252/http://www.zotero.org/blog/announcing-zotero-3-0-beta-release/" data-cite-meta="{}">released <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525045252/http://www.zotero.org/blog/announcing-zotero-3-0-beta-release/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120525045252/http://www.zotero.org/blog/announcing-zotero-3-0-beta-release/?</strong>)</span></a> yesterday. The big news is that Zotero 3.0 no longer only runs within the Firefox browser, but is now also available as a standalone version similar to other reference managers.</p>

<p>Zotero Connectors integrate with the Chrome and Safari browser. They also allow saving directly to your Zotero library at zotero.org.</p>

<p>Zotero does not support Internet Explorer. Users of this blog are not representative of all internet users, and Zotero 3.0 would offer browser support for more than 80% of them.</p>

<p>Zotero 3.0 is beta software and you should expect bugs. One small problem I discovered is that the German translation is incomplete, e.g. in the menus. But overall Zotero looks and feels very similar to the familiar Zotero 2.1 – just as a standalone version. One new feature I like is duplicate detection, an experimental feature of earlier versions.</p>
