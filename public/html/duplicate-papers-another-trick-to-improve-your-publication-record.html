In this report Mounir Errami and Harold Garner estimate that there as many as 200.000 duplicate papers in Medline or 1% of all published papers.</p>

<p>The original paper by Errami and Garner was published in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/243" data-cite-meta="{}"><em>Bioinformatics</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/243">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/243?</strong>)</span></a>.

When you search Deja Vu for scientists you know, you find scary results.</p>
<p>Nobody likes duplicate papers, but it's just another trick to improve your publication record. Another popular trick is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n11/full/7401095.html" data-cite-meta="{}">inflation <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n11/full/7401095.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n11/full/7401095.html?</strong>)</span></a> of paper authors. But the basic trick is still the heavy use of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://chronicle.com/jobs/2004/02/2004020901c.htm" data-cite-meta="{}">least publishable unit <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://chronicle.com/jobs/2004/02/2004020901c.htm">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://chronicle.com/jobs/2004/02/2004020901c.htm?</strong>)</span></a> or LPU.</p>
<p>Both authors and journals are inclined to publish as many papers as possible. So what will change these practices? If the quality of the work of a scientist isn't simply measured by numerical indices such as number of publications. So it's up to those that decide about grants and jobs to find a better way to pick up the best scientists.</p>
