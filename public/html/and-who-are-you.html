<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>two weeks ago I moved this blog from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525131414/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner" data-cite-meta="{}">Nature Network <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525131414/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120525131414/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner?</strong>)</span></a> to <strong><strong>PLoS Blogs</strong></strong>. I hope that most of my old readers have followed me here, and that I might even have a few new readers.</p>

One important strategy he uses is to ask his readers for feedback in regular intervals – he calls it delurking. AJ Cann has picked up the idea, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525131414/http://www.microbiologybytes.com/blog/2010/09/15/you-like/" data-cite-meta="{}">on Wednesday asked the readers of his blog MicrobiologyBytes <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525131414/http://www.microbiologybytes.com/blog/2010/09/15/you-like/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120525131414/http://www.microbiologybytes.com/blog/2010/09/15/you-like/?</strong>)</span></a> a few questions. I like them and have blatantly reused most of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are you and what’s your background?</li>
<li>How long have you been reading Gobbledygook?</li>
<li>Where do you read Gobbledygook – website or RSS?</li>
<li>What do you like best about Gobbledygook?</li>
<li>How could I make Gobbledygook better for you?</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be kind if you could provide some feedback in the comments section below.</p>
