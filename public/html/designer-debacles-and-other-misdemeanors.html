The two papers by biochemist Homme Hellinga delt with rational enzyme design. A second group couldn't reproduce the results, ultimately leading to the paper retractions. Then a third group was able to demonstrate that rational enzyme design is indeed possible.</p>
<p>The research highlight looks at the troubles of the second reseach group led by John Richard. He wasted a lot of time and money trying to reproduce Hellinga's findings and in the end did not gain anything.</p>
<p>Non-reproducible work is a common problem in research, and papers containing this questionable work are rarely retracted. I would guess that most of the time this is unintentional. John P. A. Ioannidis explains this in an PLoS Medicine essay: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124" data-cite-meta="{}">Why most published research findings are false <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124?</strong>)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reasons behind non-reproducible results can be calculated, and this includes drug trials in clinical medicine. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/23/3482" data-cite-meta="{}">Statistical Power of Negative Randomized Controlled Trials Presented at American Society for Clinical Oncology Annual Meetings <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/23/3482">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103129/http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/23/3482?</strong>)</span></a> found that more than half of these randomized controlled trials that showed no benefit for a new treatment did not have enough patients to detect even a medium-sized treatment effect.</p>
<p>What should we do about this? The first step is to accept the fact that a significant number of research findings you read in a paper are not reproducible. We have to be careful to start a PhD thesis or other research project based on a few exciting papers, especially when this work was done by someone else. Thinking about this, I should have taken that advice myself before starting a particular project 5 years ago.</p>
