<p>The iPad owners among the PLoS BLOGs readers can use the free Flipboard application to read all the great content that is written by my fellow ploggers PLoGsters (as suggested by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604164119/http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected/2010/09/03/latest-from-the-plogsters" data-cite-meta="{}">David Kroll <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604164119/http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected/2010/09/03/latest-from-the-plogsters">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120604164119/http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected/2010/09/03/latest-from-the-plogsters?</strong>)</span></a>). In Flipboard simply create a new section and then add content to it by following the @plosblogs Twitter account.</p>

<p>There are of course many other ways Flipboard can be used to follow science blogs, e.g. by following the @researchblogs Twitter account.
