<p>Three days ago I blogged about Yale University <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/05/yale-university-drops-biomed-central-membership" data-cite-meta="{}">dropping <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/05/yale-university-drops-biomed-central-membership">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/05/yale-university-drops-biomed-central-membership?</strong>)</span></a> their Biomed Central (BMC) membership. Matthew Cockerill, the BMC publisher yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/yale_and_open_access_publishing" data-cite-meta="{}">wrote a response <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/yale_and_open_access_publishing">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/yale_and_open_access_publishing?</strong>)</span></a>. Briefly, he argues that the author-pays model is a viable business model for Open Access publishing and that the rising costs cited by Yale are simply a reflection of the increasing number of articles submitted to BMC.</p>
<p>This is an important discussion. I believe that the costs (especially work hours) associated with publishing an article can still be reduced by intelligent use of Web 2.0 technologies (see also my blog post on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/7/9/scientific-publishing-and-microsoft-word-2007" data-cite-meta="{}">document formats <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/7/9/scientific-publishing-and-microsoft-word-2007">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blog.xartrials.com/2007/7/9/scientific-publishing-and-microsoft-word-2007?</strong>)</span></a>). I also believe that the appropriate business model very much depends on the journal type.</p>
