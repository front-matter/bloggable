<p>On August 11, the <em><em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></em> published an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/30/32/10599" data-cite-meta="{}">Announcement Regarding Supplemental Material <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/30/32/10599">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/30/32/10599?</strong>)</span></a> by Editor-in-Chief John Maunsell. In it John Maunsell announces that the journal in November will stop accepting supplementary material in article submissions.

</ul>
<p>The main arguments against supplementary information are that it overburdens reviewers (and in turn authors), and it counteracts the concept of a self-contained research report. The main argument for supplementary information is that sometimes essential information can’t be provided within the context of a journal article (e.g. video, large datasets), especially in those journals that still have print editions. Several blog posts emphasized that supplementary information is particularly important to provide the research data with the article. I think that Heather Piwowar’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/" data-cite-meta="{}">post <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/?</strong>)</span></a> is the best discussion of the relevant issues.</p>
<p>I’m obviously two weeks late with this blog posts, but I have been on vacation, and I’m only slowly catching up with all the interesting discussions that have happened while I was away. I think the discussion of supplementary information is very important, because it really is a discussion of our concept of a scientific paper. And this concept is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like" data-cite-meta="{}">changing rapidly <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like?</strong>)</span></a> for many reasons, including the push to mobile platforms, and the wish by many to publish multimedia files (e.g. 3D structures) and research data with a paper.</p>
<p><em>Phil Bourne: Beyond the PDF.</em></p>
<p>It appears to me that we haven’t talked much about supplementary information, and it really has been something everybody was doing out of necessity, without too much thinking about many of the issues, including standard formats, problems for users finding and storing this supplementary information, and copyright issues.</p>
<p>Most journals have (often similar) instructions regarding supplementary information, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Supplementary Information is peer-reviewed material directly relevant to the conclusion of a paper that cannot be included in the printed version for reasons of space or medium. –</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/submissions/final/suppinfo.html" data-cite-meta="{}">Nature <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/submissions/final/suppinfo.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/submissions/final/suppinfo.html?</strong>)</span></a></li>

<p>The announcement of the <em><em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></em> will hopefully initiate a broader discussion of the usefulness and best format of supplementary information. The most interesting aspect for me and several of the bloggers discussing the announcement is the publication of the research data associated with a paper. For now supplementary information is often the only place these data can be published, but there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/" data-cite-meta="{}">many reasons <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/?</strong>)</span></a> why this is not the best idea in the long run.</p>
