<p>Version 1.0 of the reference manager Mendeley was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041606/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mendeley-rips-beta-label-off-award-winning-research-collaboration-software-with-v10-release-126244103.html">released</a> today. In good Web 2.0 tradition it took three years from the first Beta release to the first “finished” product.

<p>Mendeley has changed reference management in many ways. Most importantly it has added another choice for users, and their constant push for new features has benefitted everybody, including the competition.</p>
<p>The Mendeley software has been downloaded one million times and 100 million papers have been uploaded to the service. Mendeley is no longer the new kid on the blog.
