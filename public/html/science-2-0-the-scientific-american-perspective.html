<p>M. Mitchell Waldrop has posted a draft version of an article called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092539/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=science-2-point-0-great-new-tool-or-great-risk">Science 2.0: Great New Tool, or Great Risk?</a>. The article will appear in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092539/http://www.sciam.com/">Scientific American</a> (which, like the Nature Publishing Group, is owned by Macmillan). In this article he talks about the increasing use of Web 2.0 technologies in research. The largest part of the article is about Open Notebook Science and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092539/http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenWetWare</a> in particular. But he also talks about science blogs and other Web 2.0 efforts such as Nature Network, which is mentioned briefly at the end of the article.</p>
<p>The draft article was posted online last week. In true Web 2.0 spirit, M. Mitchell Waldrop has invited readers to post comments and promised that he will use them for the final print version. I wrote a comment and suggested that the increasing role of Web 2.0 companies such as Google, Microsoft and Adobe in the online creation and distribution of science should be mentioned in the article.</p>
