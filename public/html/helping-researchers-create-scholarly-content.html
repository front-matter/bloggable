<p>Two weeks ago I gave a presentation at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event.php?event_id=56">STM Annual Conference 2010</a> in Frankfurt (STM is the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers). I told the audience that publishers could do a much better job helping researchers create digital content – both by providing better tools and by reconsidering licenses for content reuse.</p>
<p>A video of my presentation is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://river-valley.tv/helping-researchers-create-scholarly-content/">here</a>. The other presentations of the event can be viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/event_presentations.php?event_id=56">here</a> – unfortunately not (yet) the keynote by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101114043831/http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stephendunn">Stephen Dunn</a> from the Guardian (Beyond Publishing: how we open up to our users).</p>
