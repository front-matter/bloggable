<p>We are all familiar with digital object identifiers (DOIs) provided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122411/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> to identify (and link to) journal articles. Some of us are familiar with the DOIs issued by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122411/http://datacite.org/whatisdoi.html">DataCite</a> to link to datasets. But most of us don’t know that CrossRef is also providing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122411/http://www.crossref.org/help/Content/Components.htm">component DOIs</a> that can provide persistent links to a particular table or figure in a paper. The <em><em>PLoS</em></em> journals use component DOIs, for example for this figure:</p>

<p>Linking to component DOIs is straightforward, table 1 of the paper above is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122411/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.t001">10.1371/journal.pone.0006022.t001</a>. Unfortunately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122411/http://www.niso.org/publications/isq/free/Feeney_DOIs_for_Journals_ISQ_v22no3.pdf">only about 300,000</a> of the more than 40 million CrossRef DOIs are compontent DOIs.  There are many good reasons to use a direct (and persistent) link to a specific part of a scholarly journal article. And this becomes an even more important issue once DOIs for datasets are more commonly cited.</p>
