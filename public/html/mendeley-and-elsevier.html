<p>Earlier this week the rumors that started in January became official: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/start-up-life/team-mendeley-is-joining-elsevier/" data-cite-meta="{}">Elsevier is buying Mendeley <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/start-up-life/team-mendeley-is-joining-elsevier/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/start-up-life/team-mendeley-is-joining-elsevier/?</strong>)</span></a> (see also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://elsevierconnect.com/elsevier-welcomes-mendeley/" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://elsevierconnect.com/elsevier-welcomes-mendeley/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://elsevierconnect.com/elsevier-welcomes-mendeley/?</strong>)</span></a>).

<p>I first met Victor and Jan from Mendeley in 2008 and did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/09/05/interview_with_victor_henning_from_mendeley/" data-cite-meta="{}">interview with Victor <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/09/05/interview_with_victor_henning_from_mendeley/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/09/05/interview_with_victor_henning_from_mendeley/?</strong>)</span></a> in September 2008. We worked together in the organization of two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Science Online London conferences <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/?</strong>)</span></a> (2009 and 2010, together with Nature.com and others), and my current job started with an entry for an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/" data-cite-meta="{}">API programming contest <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/?</strong>)</span></a> co-organized by PLOS and Mendeley, with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/" data-cite-meta="{}">first lines of code written <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/?</strong>)</span></a> in the Mendeley offices during the Science Online London 2011 hackathon. I wish Mendeley all the best with their new parent.</p>
<p>What this acquisition signals to me is that commercial publishers are now moving into the software tools for scientists business at full speed. They have always done this, but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.readcube.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">ReadCube <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.readcube.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.readcube.com/?</strong>)</span></a> by Digital Science (a Nature Publishing Group sister company) in 2011, the acquisition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.papersapp.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Papers <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.papersapp.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.papersapp.com/?</strong>)</span></a> by Springer last year and now Mendeley, reference management now often means using a tool owned by a publisher â€“ this market used to be dominated academic software such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.zotero.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">Zotero <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.zotero.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.zotero.org/?</strong>)</span></a> and commercial software vendors such as Thomson Reuters (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://endnote.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">Endnote <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://endnote.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://endnote.com/?</strong>)</span></a>) or ProQuest (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.refworks.com/" data-cite-meta="{}">RefWorks <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.refworks.com/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.refworks.com/?</strong>)</span></a>).</p>
<p>For me this trend signals that publishers have realized that we are moving into an Open Access publishing model, which in contrast to subscription publishing is not about owning the content, but about providing valuable services around content that is free to read and reuse.</p>
