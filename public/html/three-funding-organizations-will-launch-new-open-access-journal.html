<blockquote>
The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and the Wellcome Trust announced today that they are to support a new, top-tier, open access journal for biomedical and life sciences research.
</blockquote>
<p>Some features of the new journal:</p>
<ul>
<li>open access</li>
<li>name of journal to be decided</li>
<li>aims to attract and define the very best research publications</li>
<li>papers will be accepted or rejected as rapidly as possible</li>
<li>first issue expected for summer of 2012</li>
<li>editor-in-chief and editorial team will be active scientists</li>
<li>journal will enable improved data presentation</li>
<li>long-term business model to be developed, the three organisations made a commitment to cover initial costs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an important announcement, as the journal has the potential to have a major impact on publishing biomedical research. Two aspects of the announcement surprise me: many details about the new journal have not been decided, I would have expected at least a decision about the journal name and Editor-in-Chief. And from the few details in the announcement the new journal appears to take a fairly conservative approach to publishing. You could for example compare today’s press release with the editorial explaining the launch of PLoS Biology from October 2003 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036" data-cite-meta="{}">Why PLoS became a Publisher <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036?</strong>)</span></a>). This approach is understandable as most scientists are conservative and don’t care much about new publishing technologies or even open access; they only care about having their research accepted in a journal with high impact. Publishing this kind of journal – which usually means high rejection rates and time-consuming editorial work – is difficult with with an author-pays business model. The deep pockets of the three funding organizations change this equation.</p>
