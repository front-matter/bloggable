<p>In December I am hosting the blog carnival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612112930/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/may-i-introduce-to-you-a-new-name-for-the-medlibs-round/" data-cite-meta="{}">Medical Information Matters <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612112930/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/may-i-introduce-to-you-a-new-name-for-the-medlibs-round/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612112930/http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/may-i-introduce-to-you-a-new-name-for-the-medlibs-round/?</strong>)</span></a>, a blog carnival about â€“ <strong><strong>medical information</strong></strong>. The deadline for submissions is next Tuesday, and I have already received a number of interesting posts. As Christmas is right around the corner, I thought that a good theme for the carnival would be a <strong><strong>wish list for better medical information</strong></strong>. This could mean many different things, e.g. a database that covers a specific area, better access to full-text papers or clinical trial results, etc. Please submit your posts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612112930/http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_6092.html" data-cite-meta="{}">here <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612112930/http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_6092.html">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20120612112930/http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_6092.html?</strong>)</span></a>.</p>
