<p>Now that I can <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/08/04/automatically-list-all-your-publications-in-your-blog/" data-cite-meta="{}">automatically import my publications from my ORCID profile and display them <span class="citation" data-cites="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/08/04/automatically-list-all-your-publications-in-your-blog/">(<strong>http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/08/04/automatically-list-all-your-publications-in-your-blog/?</strong>)</span></a> in this blog, I also want to visualize them. I have started with <a href="https://github.com/mfenner/blog/blob/master/_includes/by_year.js" data-cite-meta="{}">d3.js code <span class="citation" data-cites="https://github.com/mfenner/blog/blob/master/_includes/by_year.js">(<strong>https://github.com/mfenner/blog/blob/master/_includes/by_year.js?</strong>)</span></a> that displays the number of publications per year - using the list of my publications in Citeproc JSON format. The chart is displayed on my <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html" data-cite-meta="{}">About page <span class="citation" data-cites="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">(<strong>http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html?</strong>)</span></a>, but I have also embedded the Javascript here:</p>
<p>I am a big fan of data visualizations because they can highlight something that you would otherwise miss. In this case I was really surprised to see how well my different academic jobs over the years (1991-1993, 1994-1998, 1998-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2012) are reflected in my publication pattern. You clearly see the gaps between the jobs, indicating that I not only switched jobs, but also changed the research focus every time. The publications are listed chronologically on the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html" data-cite-meta="{}">About page <span class="citation" data-cites="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">(<strong>http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html?</strong>)</span></a> page and you can look at the papers I wrote since my first publication in 1993. My publication pattern seems to indicate that I was never really on track for a typical academic career, so it should not be a surprise that I left academia in 2012.</p>
<p>There are at least two other visualizations I want to do: publications by type (journal article, book chapter, dataset, etc.), and author position with number of co-authors. You can reuse the Javascript code with small modifications (CSS and the JSON query) even if you are not running a Jekyll blog.</p>
