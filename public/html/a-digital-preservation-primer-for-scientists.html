<p>As we have moved to digital formats both for primary research data and scientific publications, digital preservation has become critical to secure permanent access to scientific information. Digital preservation turned out to be much more difficult than creating digital content, as preservation requires long-term thinking about many issues including file formats, storage solutions and funding. Digital preservation turned out to be too big for individual libraries, publishers or research disciplines, and large collaborative efforts were started in the last five years.</p>

Before PDF/A, many organizations (including our institution) used the raster graphics format TIFF. The major advantage of the PDF format is the handling text and vector graphics in addition to raster images, allowing full-text search and smaller file sizes. Because the PDFformat is constantly changing, PDF/A was based on a specific PDF version (1.4) with the following specifications:</p>
<ul>

<li>no sound or movies</li>

<h3 id="storage-solutions">Storage solutions</h3>
<p>Hard disks, tape and optical media are possible storage solutions. Tape is the ideal solution for long-term storage of research papers, but the digital preservation of research data in many areas (e.g. sequencing, high-energy physics) can’t be done with tape because of the exponential growth of these data. Hard disk storage has another problem: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/wellcome-trust-sanger-institute-upgrade-sequencing-capacity-unveils-annual-revie" data-cite-meta="{}">energy requirements of data centers <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/wellcome-trust-sanger-institute-upgrade-sequencing-capacity-unveils-annual-revie">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/wellcome-trust-sanger-institute-upgrade-sequencing-capacity-unveils-annual-revie?</strong>)</span></a>.</p>
<p>We live in a digital world, and this of course includes how we do and communicate science. It is surprising that we have barely started to think about digital preservation.</p>
