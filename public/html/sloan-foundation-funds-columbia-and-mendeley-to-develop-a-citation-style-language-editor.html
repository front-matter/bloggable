<p>The Sloan Foundation has awarded a $125,000 grant to Columbia University and Mendeley to fund the development of a <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/" data-cite-meta="{}">Citation-Style Language <span class="citation" data-cites="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">(<strong>https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/?</strong>)</span></a> (CSL) editor. CSL is a XML-based language to format citations and bibliographies, and is used by the reference managers Zotero, Mendeley and Papers, and in many other places. Even though more than 1000 citation styles are available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235632/http://citationstyles.org/" data-cite-meta="{}">CitationStyles.org <span class="citation" data-cites="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235632/http://citationstyles.org/">(<strong>https://web.archive.org/web/20161026235632/http://citationstyles.org/?</strong>)</span></a> (and built into the tools using CSL), it has until now been fairly hard to create new citation styles â€“ editing XML files is not everyones idea of having fun. The CSL editor will be made available as open source software.</p>
<p>Building a dedicated CSL editor will be a tremendous boost to the format.
