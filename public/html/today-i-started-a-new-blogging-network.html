<p>In the last few weeks I haven’t seen any announcement for a new science blogging network (the last one was probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blog.coturnix.org/2010/09/15/alert-some-big-and-important-and-exciting-news/">Scientific American</a> in September). So I thought today would be a good day to start a new one. Earlier today I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blogs.mh-hannover.de/tumorzentrum/2010/10/15/herzlich-willkommen/">the first post</a> on the first blog hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://www.mh-hannover.de/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1">my institution</a>. The blog runs on a WordPress 3.0 installation that I hope will see more blogs in the future – our library will probably be next (they are currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://mhhbibliothek.wordpress.com/">hosted on WordPress.com</a>).</p>

<p>The new blog is the official blog of our Comprehensive Cancer Center (my day job). I will write about various aspects of the work there – something I wanted to do for a while. This is also the first time that I write in German, which will be much easier, but at the same time will reach a smaller audience. Writing for my institution will also be an interesting experience. Although I don’t think that this will start something big at our institution, institutions are in fact a good place for blogging networks. Special thanks go to Stefan Zorn in our PR department for encouraging words, and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/about-the-authors/">Henry Scowcroft</a> from Cancer Research UK for many good tips about blogging for an institution.</p>
<p>The new blog of course doesn’t mean that I stop writing here. I’m too deep into this.</p>
